BEATRICE LAZAR
November 16, 1990

My name before my marriage was Beatrice Leibovich, becoming after marriage Lazar. Iam
from Romania, the town of Galati, born on 30th of October, 1927. My father was an accountant.
My mother was home, housewife. I had a brother older than me with seven years. When I was
six years old my brother told me that Hitler came in power and we'll suffer because we are Jews.
In 1940 my parents...my father worked. My mother was a housewife and I started the
elementary school when I was a kid. I didn't suffer but later in the high school, I started to feel
that I'm Jewish because we were expelled from school. We were not allowed to learn in
Romanian schools, and I had to stay one year at home until a Jewish high school was created
where all the Jewish kids from Galati went to study. And also in 1940, when the Russians
occupied Bessarabia (ph), a strong tendency existed between the _ to leave for Soviet Union
because it was said that anti-Semitism was not so strong there and they could be able to find to
work, which wasn't true. When my fath...brother was in school, he was beaten up twice and
because he suffered so much he decided to leave and he lived in Bessarabia. My father...it wasn't
easy for him but he agreed with this because he thought that he'll save him this way. Being the
younger, I remained with my parents. After that because my father was over fifty years old, he
wasn't taken to forced...he was exempt from forced labor but he was forced to clean up the snow
for five days and then he was taken with all the Jewish men from the town as hostage. He was
interned in a school where he was living on the floor then. We were allowed to bring him a bed
and food. They didn't receive there not ever a glass with water. As hostages they were forced to
work but their food was in charge of the family, of their families. I remember that one day these
people came in the Jewish houses and they confiscated our radios and they and they said that we
are spreading rumors and that we are not allowed to own any more radios. My father remained
there interned and after two months he was set free and allowed to go home, but he wasn't able to
find to work and it was very difficult to live. He tried to work. I finished school and in 1944

after the armistice came, we started to receive news from my brother. It was like an iron curtain.
We didn't know what happened to him, but after a bit we started to have news and we learned
about him. He got married. He had two kids, and in 1946 he wrote that if he could get some
papers he would be able to come back to Romania because many Jews who came from Romania
succeeded to come back. My father worked hard to to get these papers and he had to go twice to
Bucharest. During his second trip, he fall from the tramway and he died, and this way we were
not able to get the papers for my brother and he remained in Soviet Union until 1973 when he
left for Israel with his family and after a few years he died. | finished the school at the Jewish
high school. After 1944, we were allowed to go back to the Romanian school, schools, but not
too many went because we felt that we were expelled and we didn't want to go back, so we
remained in this Jewish school. In 1944 we lived in Galati through hard days because the
Russians came as allies, as friends, and the Germans who were very...in big number, retreated.
They had to flew and they they burned the town. We stayed almost one week hidden because
they were burning everywhere. The whole town was in flames. We escaped and we were able to
return to our homes. I finished the school after that in 194...1 went I went back to school after I
stayed one year at home. But I went to to Jewish school. And I continued this Jewish school
until 1947. It was under the Communists. And in 1947 when I finished, I came to Bucharest.
PAUSE
Life for me was very difficult, very hard because of the sufferences of my parents. I was

still a kid. I wasn't able to do something on my own and my father and my father being interned
in these camps working and being over fifty years old, it was difficult for him to sustain for
himself and we had a difficult family life. I went to school and that was it. But I felt all these
consequences of the Nazis because my father suffered being a Jew so this reflected on my my
life, on our life, and we didn't...we weren't able to do too much. After that he died, so I...after
that I 1 went to Bucharest, but I wanted to...and in Bucharest I wanted to continue my studies but
