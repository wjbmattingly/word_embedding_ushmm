SAUL MERIN

April 19, 2009
Question: Good morning.
Answer: Good morning to you.
Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Professor
Saul Merin, on April 19", 2009. We are very, very pleased that you have agreed to
come and speak with us today. The interview is about your life story, and we’ ll
start, as we always do, at the beginning. Can you tell us some details about your
birth, about your family, about the world that you were born into?
A: And, thank you very much. I-I was born in a township, what they called shtetl,
the small towns where most Jewish people lived in Eastern Europe. This township
was called Bendzin. It had a — between 50 and 60,000 people — population. And it
was similar to so many other places like this. It was in southwest Poland, very close
to the German border, of more than maybe five miles.
Q: Was it a contested territory with Germany?
A: Yes, it was, always they were fighting about it. It was in Silesia, Silesia.
Schilesia in — in German. And the Germans thought that this is their country. The
Poles thought that this is their country. Before the war, all of Lower Silesia was
next to Germany, and Upper Silesia, most of it belonged to Germany. A small part
rem-remained Polish.

Interview with Saul Merin ‘
April 19, 2009
Q: In Bendzin, was it a multi-cultural town? Were there Germans living there, and
Poles living there and Jews living there?
A: That’s right, but really, the majority were Jewish people, in the town itself.
Q: How large was —
A: About 60 percent. About 60 percent of the people living in Bendzin were — were
Jewish people. And they — their language mostly was Jewish.
Q: Yiddish.
A: Yiddish.
Q: Yiddish.
A: Was Yiddish. While a — in addition, they learned Polish, and knew Polish, but
Yiddish was the major language. And there were people who lived there and spoke
German.
Q: What about you?
A: We spoke Yiddish. And — at home, it was Yiddish. I knew, of course, very well,
Polish. And I knew a little of German, not much. But I learned German during the
war, and after the war, as a child.
Q: And how is it — how was the town’s structure in social classes, for example?
Were — were Jews in a certain merchant class, or a certain class and Poles in another
and Germans in another? How was that split up?

April 19, 2009
A: The whole town was poor. Poverty was probably the characteristic finding in
town. Poverty among all classes. It was among Germans and among — among Poles,
and among the Jewish people. The — the poverty was manifested by — by the houses,
which were terrible dwellings. Many of them, there were no washrooms in the
house, they have to go out to the courtyard. Sometimes this was seen even in — in
houses which had four floors, and 20 - 30 families lived there. They had to go down
and — life was not easy, not nice. Jewish people lived there probably for longer than
many other places, because in Bendzin there was a castle, which was built by King
Casimir. Casimir, or Kazimierz in Polish. Kazimierz the Great. He was the Polish
king in the 14" century who united Poland. This is why they called him the Great.
After he united it, usually by fighting, okay, in combat —
Q: Was that the Treaty of Lublin? Was he part —
A: No.
Q: No, okay.
A: No. This was — a-and he — he really thought — he ruled over Poland. This was
unusual in Poland, because Poland was — the noblemen rule — ruled the country,
not the king. But he was strong; he was the one who ruled at that time, in the 14"
century, must have been about 1345. He invited the Jews of Germany to come over
and live in Poland. And he promised that he will take care of it — of them, he will

support them, and th — especially, he will be the one who will defend them, if there
will be problems about — in — in Poland. The Jews heard it and they just couldn’t
come at a better time for the Poles, and for the Jews, cause this was the time after
the plague, after the plague, disease, the plague epidemic, the Black Plague. While
the Germans, which — which maybe — nobody knows how much, but it probably
was not less than a quarter of the — of European population who perished at that
time from the disease, from the epidemic, and they possibly wa — it came up from
50 percent a — of the jew — of the European population. The plague was brought by
an Italian ship from the east, from somewhere in the east. The story goes, in 1943,
the — the ship came and they tried to disembark in Messina, in south

kind of, how do you call it —

A: Goods, what kind of goods they brought with them. And then he has seen th-the
sick sailors. He has seen this, he left the ship. He told them, you are not allowed to

go to Messina, you must leave immediately the port. And they left and they went
around into Venice. In Venice they disembarked.
Q: That was it.
A: Brought down the goods. And unfortunately, one of the problems was, later for
the Jews, that one of the businessmen in Switzerland had a Jew for his assistant.
And — sorry.
Q: It’s okay.
A: And he was sent to Venice to bring the goods. And he came over there and took
the goods and came back to Switzerland. The goods were infected, like all of the
goods which were [indecipherable]
Q: This is — excuse me for interrupting, but it’s interesting to hear history — first of
all, Pll back up a little bit. I have a theory, it’s a not very deep theory, it’s a little
superficial, but I have a theory that east Europeans carry around their history for
600 years.
A: That’s right.
Q: Whereas Americans don’t remember what Vietnam War was: that’s already
ancient history.
A: How right you are.

A: This was just 600 years —
Q: Yeah.
A: — from that time.
Q: And — and I’m wondering whether — whether these were stories and this was
history that you grew up with in a — in order to explain how the Jews came to
Bendzin, or is this —
A: Yes.
Q: — information that you learned later, history that you learned later?
A: No, it was — no, I th — I think I knew about it already as a child. I knew about it,
because it’s very important for the life of Jewish people in Bendzin. You see, when
the plague broke out, the Germans accused the Jews, that they brought in the
plague, that they caused the plague, they caused the death of at least one-quarter of
the European population, and thousands of Jews were massacred as a —
Q: Result.
A: — result of this. And when he invited the Jews to come, tens of thousands left
Germany into Poland. Poland, til then, had one small community in Kalish(ph), a
town more to the north [indecipherable]. And after this there were many
communities which were put up.

Q: So you could sa — so one could say that Bendzin was one of the oldest Jewish
communities in Poland.
A: Yes, that’s what I think, yes. This wa — this was what we knew about it. This was
one of the oldest — because Jews settled near the king they loved. And —
Q: This is the other point I wanted to bring up, th — and again, excuse me for
interrupting, but it sounds from what you’re saying, is that there are traces of a
Polish patriot in you, in your telling, because of — now, I could be wrong, I’m — this
is why I’m testing this out, because it sounds like the story was a favorable story to
Poland, that it was a refuge, that it was a country where one could live. It was a
country that offered survival and reprieve. And the reason I — I — I bring this up is
that just recently there was a Professor Polonsky who was the chair of Judaic
studies at Brandeis, gave a presentation where he said, until World War 2, many
Jews believed that about Poland.
A: Yes.
Q: Many Jews believed that about where they lived. And so that’s why I’m asking
you, is that —
A: Yes.
Q: — is there something to this?

Interview with Saul Merin "
April 19, 2009
A: Yes, Lagree fully with this. Many Jews believe that they are — they are Jewish,
but they — that the Poles can be depended upon, and we should live with the Poles.
Th-This happened at the time of Tadeusz Kosciuszko, when Berek
Yoselevich(ph), a Jew from Warsaw, from the other side of Warsaw, Fraha —
Fraga(ph). He put up a battalion that fought in the mutiny of Kosciuszko, as a
separate battalion under — under the order of — of yos — of Berek Yoselevich(ph),
Berek Yoselovich. And Poles that remember this, will find his name anywhere oret
— of how he fought. He fell in — in combat. He died in combat. But he dus —anyhow,
in—in Bendzin, most Jews went to Krakow. Krakow was the place where the king
lived, and they put up a town near Krakow and called it Kazimierz, which is this
still today, after the king. But in this place, the castle which he built, on the shores
of a river, he — this town was built, Bendzin, and Jews lived there, I think for
centuries. I lived in the place where I was born, and I lived on the street corner
called the Street of the Castle. And I could throw a stone and hit the castle, it was
in the same —
Q: That was that close?
A: It was very close, yes. It was on the same street.
Q: Did you live di— were you born into one of those houses that had four stories
high, and a courtyard below?

A: Yes, yes, yes, exactly, exactly like this. For there were three, like buildings
around a courtyard, and I lived on the third floor in one of them, on the — the site
where there was no building like this, there was a small building of three stores
only, or what do — what — shops in the lower floor, and then two floors of
apartments, which belonged to my grandfather.
Q: So, it was extended family who lived together?
A: Yes.
Q: Let’s turn a little bit to your own family, within this context, within this
community and within this history. When were you born? What was the date of
your birth?
A: 1933. August, 1930 — end of August, 1933.

A: 1933.
Q: But the date in August was — I — August —

A: Okay. She was born in a village nearby, a village about 20 miles from there.
Q: In this — in Bendzin, if there was such poverty, what did people do to make their
— earn their living? How did they earn their living?
A: I think it was lot different from other places in Poland. They lived there as
owners of small shops. This was — my father had a small shop given to him by his
father, by my grandfather. And he became very religious, and — and my mother was
really running it. And I—
Q: What did you sell? What —
A: They were selling all kinds of — they called it galanteria in Polish.
Q: How — and —
A: You know, okay —
Q: And —

and umbrellas and things like that.

Q: Do you think that that would have been your future, had there been no war, that
you would have taken over the shop?
A: Oh, that’s a difficult question. I was too young to — to even — to think about it. I
believe my father would like me to go to the yeshiva and become a rabbi, or like
this, but it will — there was no chance for it, I would never agree to it. Already as a
child five year old, I knew that that will not be my way.

A: —a ruler, you know, which he had there, in his hand. A — and I hated it. And I
did not like the way they were learning it, you know, to repeat after the rabbi what
he said, and this was the way of learning. I didn’t like it. This I know very well.
And on any occasion I had, I wou — I run away from them.
Q: Well, three years old is a very young — for a small child to be so —

Not at the beginning, but already at the age of four I was definitely running away.

good friends, and he tried to take me always when he was going to work, and I was
with him on the cart there, going like this. The other people — so there there were all

— were all in this. The most — the most common, I would say, and the most Jewish
profession — you probably don’t know it, but the most Jewish profession at that
time, my opinion, was porters.
Q: Really?
A: Yes. These people were taking things on their shoulders and carry them from —
they were Jewish, almost exclusively Jewish.
Q: Like loaders, people who would take heavy sacks on their shoulders and —
A: Yes, heavy loads and these were Jewish. Almost exclusively. We knew it —
Q: How do you explain it?
A: Well, th-the problem was that the Poles didn’t like Jews, and you know, if we
liked King Kazimierz, there were not many like him. And he — he — he was
exceptional. And the Poles tried to make, for Jews, life difficult. And one of things
they did was not to — too much to work with them. Now, if you were a doctor, if
you were a—a tailor, and you were good at it, and really they came to you, most
Jews and Poles, and — and they worked with you, because it was good for them to
do it. But if you didn’t have any education, if you didn’t have any professional
education, you were not a tailor, you were not a [indecipherable] you didn’t learn
anything, then the only thing that was left for you was to work as a porter.

A: And I —I think this was the reason why they work. I knew — I knew children of
the porters who were my age. I remember them. They had the very difficult time.
Their income was low. They hardly could have shoes to walk around with them.
And I— I’m not sure how mu — what they were doing about it, you know, and
certainly their parents, uneducated. They couldn’t do anything else, except this.
Q: Was there mandatory schooling for children, all children?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: No. Schooling is another interesting fact about the place, because there was one
secondary school, one high school, and the one high school was — my father learned
in it. Was called Yavener(ph) at the time, and the language of teaching was
Hebrew. This was the only secondary school, high school in town. So the Poles —
Q: So the Poles didn’t have their own?
A: No.
Q: There was no education —
A: I—I’m not sure they have now, but they didn’t have at that time. This was the
only one. And so when a Pole wanted to learn in high school, would get
matriculation, for instance, the only way for him was to learn in Hebrew. Go to that
school —

they knew that in another 10 days, Pesach comes, Passover. And then they will eat
as much as they want. Or another holiday, or the Sabbath. Was no way, even the
poorest people, that on the Sabbath they would not — the whole family would not sit
down and eat, really as one should. You know, no way. They would be ashamed of
it. They wouldn't be ashamed during the week that they cannot give their children
enough to eat, but on the Sabbath they would certainly be ashamed of, and they
would do anything, you know, on Sabbath and the holidays, that they did — the

immediately after the war broke out, they didn't have much to go.
Q: That’s right across the border, yeah.
A: Just across the border. The first Saturday after this, they came and burned down
the shul, the synagogue. And they burned it down with all the people were praying
inside. And whoever tried to escape was shot.

A: No.

A: And the — I don’t know, I was — at the time, on Saturday when they burned it
down, they came and then they announced to all people around in the other houses

hear anything from what was going on down the street?
A: It was a noise there. We heard that it’s burning. I heard them talking about it,
that they burned down the synagogue. We didn't think that this happens with the
people inside. And there were s-some survivors from it, succeeded to run away, and
they went to a nearby church. And the priest of the church really hid them, he was

—I learned how to write in maybe a couple of months when she was teaching me.
Then she didn’t come. And I asked my parents what happened, they didn’t want to
tell me. And then I heard that, one day a talk between them, and one of them saying
that her parents are accusing my parents about what happened. And then I
understood what happened. When she left our house after teaching me, she went
back to her home. She had to cross a lawn which was on the way, quite a large
lawn, and when she went through it a German soldier went by and just shot her,
killed her on the way. I-I — I remember, when I heard this, I was shocked by it. First
time in my life that I really started to understand what’s going on with the Germans
in that time. All schools were of course closed, and there was no way, even
religious schools, like I learned in the chayder, so I could like, continue, up to a
certain time when the — the rabbi was taken to Auschwitz. And I start in another
place and the rabbi also was taken away a short time later, and there was no way to
learn. I started my school only a-after the war.
Q: What happened with your mother’s galanteria? Obviously, even before the war,
it must have suffered. Did you have Polish customers before the war?
A: One — and, yes, undoubtedly, most customers were Polish. Nearby was a shop, a

until the war broke out in — at the end of 1939, beginning of 1940, we were
informed that the house of my grandfather is [indecipherable] too much into the
street. And so they had to leave it in 24 hours, and they demolished it, the German —
not the Germans, but the people who worked for them, and — including the Jewish.
Q: So that meant that in this — was this house owned by your grandfa-father? In
other words, it was his asset, it was his property?
A: Yes, yes, yes.
Q: Completely destroyed?
A: Oh, the whole house was destroyed, yes. This was his major property, he lived
on this because he rented this — the shops downstairs and — and he rented the other —
th-the other apartments. He lived in one of them, and he rented the other, four or
five other.
Q: Tell me a little bit about this grandfather. Did you ha — did — did he play a role in
your life, in your childhood? Do you remember, or was he a more distant person?
A: H-He was — no, he was like a grandfather. When I was born, probably in that
time, my parents didn't have an apartment of their own, they lived with the
grandfather. I was born there, this I was told. Then they moved over to this
apartment. H-H-He was — he was like a zayde should be, you know, like a

your own?

A: We spoke very little about it, if at all, if at all. They never, ever, ever, ever spoke
with me about it, really. And the truth is that I think they — they were clever to do it,
not to tell me anything, because it certainly frightened me, there’s no doubt about
this. But they knew what’s going on in my head, you know. They knew that I live a
— in an imaginary world. And all this just kind of doesn’t belong to me, and they
knew it. And I remember my father saying to me, we’re going down to try to open
the sukkah. The sukkah for — a sukkah. And they said to me, you know, and I was
trying to explain to him, because there — there were several things he couldn’t do.
He was not allowed to go at [indecipherable] outside, he had to put it in this —
which is not according to the religious laws and the — there’s several things, also
with the sukkah, he couldn’t put this way, he had to put it in another way, and he
said that’s not the way it should be done, it should be — and then he looked at me
and he said, you know, I envy you. It’s good to be a child at this time. You know,
when — he knew I am living in an imaginary world, which is not the world of
[indecipherable] during the war. And I think this was the way, really, you could
keep yourself normally.

sent over for deportation, as they called it. Deportation was Auschwitz. Auschwitz
was not more than about an hour by train from our place. And so, at that time, we
learned something. And we learned this, that they — they are taking away larger
families, because it’s easier for them. If they have to take, they come over in there
to bring a thousand Jews, they take larger families, then they do it quicker and it’s
for them much easier. We survived this because what happened is that a Jewish
policeman was there, they were helping the — the Germans. And they were
policemen of the Judenrat. And the Jewish policeman was a distant relative of
ours. So he said, you don’t take — stay here. Went out and locked the outer lock on

they left already and locked the door.

What happened? She say, I have seen today that the Gestapo took all the members

piece of land which belonged to this — to the room which we had, because no Jew
was allowed more than one room. So he built this, and I remember somebody

some to come and some not, they are taking everybody. The same — so we be — we
had no choice. Now, there were — it was impossible, because they put heavy guards
around the ghetto. It was impossible to leave. We went down into what we called
the bunker. The bunker, many families arranged some way out, to escape, because,
if it was not the Judenrein and they were coming and taking, then they took
anybody whom they found. They — they didn’t look too much for it, but yes. So we
went down into the bunker, and the bunker was a very good one. You had to go
through a — through a cupboard like this, to move a drawer, and then to open
another door like this, and went to go down over a ladder, and into the bunker. Very
difficult, nobody could really — when you open the cupboard, you wouldn’t see
anything. So we went down. This was prepared for exactly such a case. It was
prepared for four people. In a short time we found ourselves with 16 other people,
and you couldn’t say anything, I mean, all our family came, cause they knew that
our bunker is the best. We stayed there for three days, probably the worst three days
of my life. It was terrible. It was August, very hot, small place. It was —

terrible. On the third day they understood how it’s done. They came over there and
they couldn’t find the entrance into this, so they went down into the basement and
started to break the wall. Soldiers came and start to break the wall. When they did
it, and they opened the hole, there were my cousin, older than me by three or four
years shouted we — we give in, we don’t — we give up and we are — we are going
out. So the soldier shouted, all right, how do we get in here? So he told him where
to open it. Started to go out, and they took all of us to the place where we were
waiting for the train to Auschwitz. It was terrible three days, really, it’s not only — I
tried once to go out, and it was quiet, to find water. And they couldn’t, there was no
water anywhere, they closed the water, the Germans. So there was no water

other, on the other. But it were terrible three days. And then they were taken to the
station, to the train station. It was — it was not the regular train station, it was a
station which was made up for Jews, to take up the Jews. And we were waiting
there surrounded by the German soldiers. And there my mother told me, you must
run away, must run away. So I said, okay. I took my sister with me, and I broke out.
There was a fence with — a wooden fence, so I could break up one place, and being
a slim boy, could easily get through, and my sister was slim as I was. And we went
through it. After a few minutes, when we were there hiding on the other side of the
fence, I found out that we are in a German military camp.

the train was already coming in, I thought, that’s the last chance that we have, and I
tried it another time. And th-this time we succeeded. We went by, not far from the
German watchman who was there. He — he was looking over the street on the other
side. He didn’t look anybody would walk nearby him, cause he wouldn’t think that
any Jew would do it. And this was just off the edge, where all the Poles were
coming through. So, the only thing I felt was — my thought was only, how does it

out of — that — that issue went off the table.
A: How right you are. How right you are, you know. That’s exactly so. You know,
for the first time in — in my life, my young life, I felt sorrow about my father, cause
I felt how much he suffers. And for the first time in my life I came to him, I said,
look, if you want to teach me religious stuff, I want you. Just say when, I am
coming and learn it. First time. Cause he knew that I don’t like.
Q: And how did he react to that?
A: He was — I think he was happy that he — he gave me lessons.
Q: Did you feel closer to him, besides having sympathy and seeing his sorrow, did —
did you feel like he was closer to you, too?
A: Yes, I think so. I think so. For the first time that he really —I felt that he
understands me better. But I certainly did understand him. I knew that he is
suffering this. So we went — we left this place, and the two of us went to town. And

Q: Wow.
A: We were hiding in a place what — what — there was a — it was one room when she

a cupboard between the two, so anybody who came in has seen only one room, and

smaller.

Q: Well, did she have a family, or was she living by herself?
A: She was single, but her family was in the village. The family certainly did not
support her. One day when I asked her what would your family do if they would

unlikely that they will do anything, because they were friends. They took them all to
Siberia. And many, many of them survived, because of this. But what she did, she
decided we’re not going to Siberia. On the way [indecipherable] and succeeded to
flee from that train. They were stopping the train from time to time, once ina
couple of days, and so — to supply, to buy some products, and that’s what they did.

Germans came in. When the Germans came in, her husband was killed on the same
thing. They went from house to house looking for communists and Jews and took
them, and all the men were shot in the same thing. She told me how after a couple
of days, she went to the Gestapo and told them look, my husband is in prison.
Would you — I brought him a sweater because it’s cold. And the German looked at
it, gave it back to her. He doesn’t need it. So she understood. She stayed with her

what — what — what they did to survive. When she came back in April ’45 — no, it
was the first time, she said, I will take care of, we will not staying here with
Aniela(ph) or with Wolfe. You will come with me. She had the son, the son
survived with her and she really took very good care of — of me and in fact, she
never let me feel that I am not her son, or Dina is not her daughter.
Q: I was going to ask, did she take Dina, too? Yes.
A: She — yes. We’re all — we were three of us there like brothers and sister.
Q: And you stayed in Bendzin, you moved to Israel?
A: No, she moved to another town there, Hoczew, and this was the place where she
lived before the war, not far from there, a more German town than ours, Bendzin.
And we stayed there. In 1940 — in 1946, the chief rabbi of Israel, Yitzhak Herzog,
came to Poland, and he had an agreement with the Polish government that he can
take children up to the age of 14, if they are orphans, they will go with him to
Israel, Palestine at that time. And so we joined this train. Went with him, but it was
stuck in Prague, and then we went to Austria, where we had that distant relative of
the new husband of my aunt. And they stayed — w-we stayed there for some time,
decided to go back to Poland because you couldn’t move on. And it was a camp of
the DPs in Linz. The DP camps were run by the Americans, and by the Joint. So
there were Jewish people of the Joint there wh-who were really helping us a lot.

And the Americans, they were running the places. And it was Bindermichl, and the
other place in Linz was Wegsheid. Just these days I see in the newspaper a picture
of Wegsheid, which was not far from there. So, we — we stayed there and came
back to [indecipherable]. When — already in 1945, we understood that our parents
will not come back. You know, at the beginning, the first few months, e-every —
everybody who knocking on the door, maybe they are coming back, or one of them
is coming back. But towards April or May, it was clear that nobody would come
back. In fact, I tried to find out what happened with them. I went to Auschwitz,
cause that time I was 11, I went to Auschwitz with my cousin, tried to look there
over this, the only thing I could find is in — in the gas chambers that was written the
kemar(ph) — revenge, which they have written with their blood.
Q: Were there people, were there officials in Auschwitz? Was there anybody
manning — I mean, I don’t mean Germans, I mean, had anyone else come in, was
the place empty, was it deserted?
A: It was deserted in that time. The-They opened it as a museum much later —
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A: But at that time it was just deserted. You could come in, you could go in, look
where — whatever you want, at wherever you want, and that’s — that’s what we did.

A: I—I wouldn’t know it.

A: I wouldn’t know it.

Q: How did they behave? Did you have any interaction with the Russian soldiers?
A: Not too much.

A: Not too much. My cousin left immediately, he had a — a red —

A: — banderola(ph) — armband, like this. And he went down. And I’ve seen the

No, there was not much communication with the Russians. The Russians left
Auschwitz also, very quickly.
Q: So they were on to Berlin?
A: Yes, they went on. This was the south, I believe, to Berlin, where Zhukov and
his army was more to the north.
Q: That’s right, that’s right.
A: This was a southern army that moved out. The Poles didn’t behave too well after
the war, you know. I remember first time that I really went out, to the square of the
city center, pole — position where a man stood at one of the windows and gave a
speech about new Poland, and the communist Poland. They called it the socialist
party, and the socialist Poland. And they said that the Russian promised that if they
will behave really like true communists, they will change the name of the party
from the socialist part of Poland to the communist party of Poland. Very like today
that they say that. And I was standing there listening to him, together with
thousands of Poles, when the woman said to me, you are Jewish? I said yes. She
said, how do you survive? So I told her, a Polish woman helped us. She said oh
God, she said, oh God. And a boy much older than I was, you know, heard it from
[indecipherable] what Jew, you are a Jew? Ga — gave me a fist in my head, in my
face. And you know, to me, then I understood that they don’t like us too much. I

couldn’t find a — a barber to — to make my head, which looked terrible, of course,
after all these years. Nobody wanted to take me, when he understood that I am
Jewish, yes.
Q: That’s an awful lot for an 11 year old to have to look at, to deal with — 12 year
old.
A: Yes, yeah. It was not nice. You know, at that time it was really — later on — I
went to Poland again. I left in 1949 for Israel, when — when it was allowed, when
the Polish government allowed the people to go out to Israel, only to Israel. But
many years later I’ve been in Poland, just like eight or 10 years ago. So now they
accepted me, now in a different way, because I came, they knew at the time a
professor of ophthalmology and I immediately also invited a Polish ophthalmologist
to come to Israel and I will help him for a couple of weeks to see the country, but
maybe to learn about ophthalmology in Israel. And they were very happy about it.
Made a dinner for me and so this was very nice. And I tried to think all the time, is
there still anti-Semitism in Poland? And you know what? It changed completely. It
became ridiculous. It’s not that there is no anti-Semitism, but it’s an anti-Semitism
of — of a ridiculous sort. You could only laugh at it, you know? I remember my — a
—a cousin of mine in Israel went to the town, to Bendzin, and he took pictures,
video pictures, he had a—a team which [indecipherable] for him. And then he

asked people, he went to the school. The school exists, but it’s not called
Furstenberg.
Q: What happened to Furstenberg?
A: Fursten(ph) was killed by the Germans, like anybody else. It was — you know,
they didn’t kill people because they were poor or rich, they killed people because
they were Jewish. He was Jewish, that was enough. He spoke at the school. They
asked him to speak, which — so he spoke with them, and si — before I start my talk,
who knows what was the name of the school before the war? Not one of them
knew. Said, did you hear the name of Furstenberg? Not one of them knew. So he
told them the history of the school and about. Then he went into a place that looked
very similar to our house. So it’s three buildings around a large courtyard. It was in
another part of the city. I knew that there were two places like this. Ours was
destroyed later, cause they put the — a road there. They built a road there. And the
other place, he went there. And in both places there were Jewish — there only Jewish
people living. And he went around, first in the main street of the city and asked
people, remember the Jews who lived here? Nobody know. He went into this house,
where only Jews lived, in all of the three buildings. And when they came out and
they were standing around him, and he says to them, remember the Jews who lived
here? Not one. You look at the people, he took pictures. Old people that certainly

lived there, you know, in the second World War. Nobody remembers. Then a dog
passed by, and he looks at the dog, and the woman sticks out her head from one of
the windows and calls, Aaron, Aaron. So he says to her, that’s the name of the
dog? She says yes. Why Aaron? So she says, Aaron, that’s so that we remember
the Jews who lived here. This was the first time that he found somebody who
remembered the Jews, you know, through the dog. This is ridiculous. That’s not the
same anti-Semitism that frightened my parents and the Jews before the war, or even
after the war, in the first years after the war. It — it was just same like before the
war, in Kielce, the pogrom in Kielce where more than 40 Jews were killed in 1946.
Q: How do you explain that? How do you explain it?
A: You know, I’m not sure that I tried to think even about it. It certainly changed,
there’s no — today, it stopped at — it’s something on a personal level, it’s not —
certainly not that [indecipherable] of a country.
Q: Did you feel when you were — when you were meeting with people, and they had
this dinner, that there was a lack of sincerity? That there was a lack of
understanding, of genuineness, that somehow or other you couldn’t trust what it was
that you were seeing?
A: That they could not trust?
Q: No, that you could not.

A: Well, may — may well be like this, yes. That — that I couldn’t trust everything
that was said to me. You know, after I invited the ophthalmologist, I got maybe
three or four calls from the mayors of the townships of — which belonged to this
area, and they were all at the dinner, five mayors, cause these were the places where
Jews — Jewish people lived around, including Sztemaszitsa(ph), the — the village of
my mother. And after I left, and I left the invitation for one of the [indecipherable]
from Dombrowa, one of the fi — five townships. I got later maybe three or four
calls from the mayors. Look, maybe you take them for three weeks instead of two
weeks. And another one calls me, maybe you know, I have somebody else who may
be better, maybe we’ll take two ones, you know. [indecipherable] the Poles, one
must understand it. I don’t know if you read the book, it was Michener, was
[indecipherable] Poland.

Q: No, but I heard of it, I know of it.

A: You know, when you read it, you — you read the history of a tragedy. The Poles
suffered always, from the beginning. The Jews suffered more, but it was a tragedy
for the Poles, what was going on there. The Swedes attacked them, I think it was the
17 century, 17" or 18", I believe 17" century, and massacred the Poles. You know,
they killed thousands, thousands of Poles. And if it wasn’t the Swedes, then it was
the Russians or the Germans, the Prussians, you know, all of the time. They

suffered a lot. And on the — on the personal level, they suffered from the system, it
was a feudal system. Why are there so many Polish jokes, the Polack jokes in — in—
in the United States, you know, because they came when the [indecipherable] was
— was annihilated at the beginning of the 20" century, after the second World War,
the end of the second World War, suddenly they could trave — they could g — and
many of them traveled to the United States, they had relatives here or so — they
came over here, most of them settled in Chicago, and it’s not only they didn’t know
English, cause Ukraines also didn’t know English when they came over, and —
Q: You're talking probably the first World War, yes?
A: Yes, first war.
Q: First World War, mm-hm.
A: Did I say second? No, first World War. And the Ukraines when they came over,
they also didn’t know English. They didn't know English, but they didn’t know
anything, they were uneducated. They didn’t know to read and to write, most of
them. It — and — because in the feudal system they couldn’t go to school without
permission to go to school was not given by the noblemen. [indecipherable] want
the educated people here, I need workers here. And so, they [indecipherable]

them. And for this they have to show that the Jews are inferior. And if they can kill
the Jews, or you know, curse them or show their inferiority, then it gives them the
superiority complex. I think that’s the main reason for [indecipherable] anti-
Semitism. That’s it. I—

if you want.
A: You know, if I divide my history, my story into four periods, the fourth period
was different. That’s th — that’s the time when I came to Israel, and for the first
time in my life I felt like equal with equals. There was no problem any more. I
knew that when I go to school, I will not be chased up like in the Polish school
where I remember very well. In mathematics, I’m very good in mathematics. I knew
it, there was no doubt about it. But always I was given a very low —

One day she came, and she said, whoever will — I’m giving here some exercises to

And she was — I knew, that’s mine. I filled it out for it, I came much before the
second one, to give it to her. And she didn’t take it, she was sitting there, she didn’t
take it, she waited. Then another boy came after me, and she took his. I said, I was

professor of ophthalmology, so I could devote a lot to teaching. I became a
professor also here at the University of Illinois, where from time to time I have

two years.
Q: In what country?
A: In Malawi.

A: Malawi is southeast. And then I came back maybe 10 times to Africa, each time
for periods of between three months to one month. And I liked it. It’s only mi —
maybe five years ago when I went back to Rwanda to operate, to operate people.
And so there are, at least, 2,000 Africans who are walking around, who are walking
around there seeing, just because I operated them, you know? So it gives you a
good feeling. Maybe that’s the — the revenge on the Nazis — Nazis. They not only

from Gaza as well. And I continue with this, I like it, and —
Q: Do you — do you have more interaction beyond — beyond being a doctor to them?
Is there any way of — of — I don’t even know how to put the question. Do your
Palestinian patients get to know you, do you get to know them in some ways?
A: Well, they know me and they like me, I’ve no doubt about it. You cannot get
through a certain level. A couple — also because of different attitude and different
way of thinking, you know? It was maybe three or four months ago, where I gave
an injection into the eye of an Arab patient. It’s a thing which I do a lot, I give at
least 10 injections every week. That’s the modern, new way to treat some eye
diseases. And I gave him this injection. And he stands up and says, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you. After four or five times I say to my nurse, look, he
knows two words in English, thank and you. So tell him to speak Arabic, and you’ ll
translate for me. So she said all right. And he say something in Arabic, and she
translates it to me. He wants to bless you. And he wants to tell you — to wish that
you will have four wives. So, you know, this was — so it is a different way of
thinking.

A: He means well, I have no doubt. I said they liked me there.
Q: Professor Merin, the last question I have before we end, unless there is
something else that you would like to add to what we have talked about, is that my
impression is that you didn’t — you didn't have a chance to really be a child, except
in very stolen moments, when you were growing up. That you had to grow up and
be pretty strong, very early on. That’s my impression. Is that true?
A: That’s certainly very true. I — in fact, the only thing that — the only thing that I
behaved like a child is the place in — in — in the hiding place, there, wa — how I
played with my sister. And this was all about imaginary things with the — we put up.
So this was one and a half years that we played around with this, lucky, because I
think that allowed me to live normally, almost, at least from th-the — the point of
view of my soul, you know, about — which was a chil — child’s soul at that time, you
know, at the — this was only one and a half years, just at the time when it was the
worst time for me. You know, li-living without my parents, living in a place like
this, in a closed place like this, and living on very poor food. Just in that time, I
think I felt a child at that time. Just playing around with all this, and —

A: —I think this was lucky, yes, this was lucky. I think it happened also with the
other children, who survived at that time, that they — they survived because they
played the imaginary plays, you know? And this kept them alive.
Q: When you had your own children, did you play with them more because —
because of that? Did you — did — was there anything from this entire history that
showed up when your children were the same ages that you —
A: I never — I never made such decisions, but yes, the truth is that it was like this.
You know, you are all the time — I was already a doctor. I— I married when I was a
student, and I was a doctor when I had children already. And in Africa when they
came to — with me to Africa, and there was not a night, unless I was busy in the
hospital in the evening, was not a now — a night that I didn’t sit down with them for
half an hour at least, and tell them a story. All imaginary stories, you know. But
they still remember it day — today. My son here, well, I think he told to his children
already, some of the stories I was telling them at the time. All right.
