THEODORE FEDER
June 2, 1995
Abstract
Theodore [Ted] Feder was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 21, 1914. His family was
originally from Stolbtsy [Stowbtsy], but, before Ted was born, there was a pogrom in the area and his
family moved to Milwaukee. In college, Ted’s sister Sara befriended Golda Meir. Ted was surrounded
by Zionism; his sister and Golda headed a Polish Zionist group in Milwaukee. While Ted was working at
Fort Knox, during World War II, as a warrant officer adjutant, he decided that he wanted to go overseas
to see if he could help rebuild Europe after the war. He applied to the United Nations Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration [UNRRA] and was put ona ship with 400 other men on the day the atom
bomb was dropped. After landing in England, Ted made his way to Germany and was involved with
documentation and keeping statistics about where people were repatriating to. After six months, he left
and joined the Joint Distribution Committee [JDC]. As part of the JDC, Ted was involved with the
distribution of supplies and other necessities, such as psychiatrists, to DP camps. He was also involved
with creating employment for residents of the DP camps. Although the UNRRA was in charge of
supplying the necessary materials, that was only the bare necessities, and the JDC was the organization
that enhanced the diets and lifestyle of those in the DP camps. He met his wife, who (at the time of this
interview) does research at a New York hospital in White Plains in the field of geriatrics, while working
for the JDC, and has three children, a son in England with two boys and two daughters in New York, both
with two children. While working with the JDC, Ted also met Oskar Schindler and gave him money,
through the JDC, to start another factory in South America. In the final tape of this interview, tape four,
Ted explains what is happening in several pictures he has of his time in Europe.

Interviewer: Ted, | need you to begin by telling me your name, where you were born and your date
of birth.
Theodore: Okay. I'm called Ted, but my name is Theodore D. Feder. | was born in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. And | had two sisters and a brother, and a mother and dad.

Theodore: Must I? February 21, 1914.
Interviewer: | Why don't you tell me a little bit about your family and personal background;
reconstruct it?
Theodore: Let me start in the place called Stolbtsy [Stowbtsy], S-t-o-I-b-t-s-y, formerly White
Russia, now Belarus, where a family was growing up. The family had a hotel, which was

used as a way Station for Jews going to Palestine. This was a tense century. My two
sisters, not my mother, she was a very strong-willed person, were influenced by a man
called Zalman Shazar, who later was president of Israel. With the pogroms in that area,
they moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and there the family had a delicatessen, a
grocery. The two daughters went to grammar school and high school. And in college,
one of my sisters, Sara, Sara Feder, became friendly with a woman by the name of Golda
Meyerson -- | have a picture to prove it -- who later became Golda Meir. And there are
pictures somewhere in my archives about Golda taking me to kindergarten. Now, it isn't
that | was influenced by Golda at that age, but | was in a grouping where, as a
youngster, | was sort of pulled in. And that was in Milwaukee. There was a Polish
Zionist group, headed, of course, by Golda and my sister. And so | can't say that in my
mother's milk | was given Zionism, but | certainly grew up with it and | had a great love
for my sister Sara. | followed her around like a little dog. And slowly, all of this began to
come toa point. Now Golda, after World War I, decided to go to Palestine. She told her
husband, "I'm going. Do you want to come? Do. If not, stay here." He went. When it
came to my sister, she said the same thing to her husband, and then stopped. And so
my sister didn’t go to Palestine, but was one of the founders of the Pioneer Women
Organization in the United States, where for close to 25 years she was one of the
leaders. Throughout all this period and also during the war, when | was in Fort Knox,
anyone who really wanted to know knew what was happening in Europe. The Jewish
Telegraphic Agency had all kinds of information, speakers coming to the Louisville YMHA
because | was at Fort Knox, which was near Louisville, and as a warrant officer adjutant |
also read documents that had information, not too much, about the struggles that were
going on in Europe, mainly from a military point of view. All of this decided me that
what | really wanted to do for my life was to go overseas, when it was over, and see if |
could be helpful.

Interviewer: — What year are you talking about when you got -- started getting information about the
Jewish situation?

Theodore: This was after the war started, 1941. | was at Fort Knox from 1941, and | ended my stay
there on a day that a document came through from General Marshall, and | even have a
copy of it, in which the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration [UNRRA]
was asking for staff to be allowed to leave the army and come overseas and work for the
United Nations. | immediately put in. Maybe one of the reasons that | was able to get
in was that | had had a small association with the United Nations at Fort Knox when one
day we were asked to pick 30 drivers about the same age, same height, and | did it. And
there were commendations from the commanding general about how well we did it.
And when | put in my application to the UNRRA, | put that in as well. And | think that
may have tipped it, when | came overseas with the UNRRA, and that was a saga too,
because it was ona ship with 400 people that had left the army to go into Europe with
the UNRRA, and we left on the day that the atom bomb was dropped. So everybody on
that ship was unhappy because they would have been discharged if they stayed, but
they went along. We landed in England, and something happened there that was
important, as far as my knowledge of what was happening in Europe. At the
headquarters of the UN, the UNRRA in Washington, they were very adamant that we, as
members of the Armed Forces, and the UN, should not get involved in the black market.

Don't take hard currency, take traveler's checks. You can't get into the black market. |
thought it strange that that was something that was being talked about. When in
London, | needed some pounds. The only place | could go to was the US Army Finance
Office. When | got there, | saw a long line of 300 or 400 men, officers, G.I’s. | got in line.
We -- | was dressed in an officer's uniform, with a tab on my shoulder saying UNRRA.
None of them had ever seen anything like that, so | was a curiosity. And after |
answered their questions, | asked them questions. | said, "What are you doing waiting
in line?" At which point, a fellow put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a stack of, |
don't know how many tens of thousands of French francs. He says, "I'm going to change
these French francs into dollars, and | will have made $25,000." | was startled. And sure
enough, all these men were bringing money in. Whatever they sold, | didn't ask,
whether it was Army stuff or whatever, cigarettes in the PX. But when | got to the front
of the line, | threw my $100 in traveler's checks, the fellow there says, "What do you
want to come to me for? You're going to get legal right. You go around the corner and
you'll get 30 percent more." Now, | tell the story because this element was very
important in war-torn Europe. When | finally got to Germany and | was in the
headquarters of the United Nations Rehabilitation Relief Administration, and | was
involved in documentation and statistics and so on, | felt very uneasy. | felt very uneasy
because | saw many things that were happening that were certainly not something |
wanted to be associated with. Namely, the UNRRA took on as refugees, ex-Wehrmacht,
even some of the soldiers who had been SS, and it was a very curious mix. And in
addition, they were repatriating. The Russians came in and took their Russians. The
Poles came in and took their Poles. The only group not touched was the Jews. And that
was of great interest to me. And | -- on the side, | kept statistics separately to see just
what it was. And | was always talking to Herb Katzki, whom you have been talking with.
And incidentally, | got my job -- Herb doesn't agree -- but there were two of them, Harry
Beal and Herb Katzki -- | had a hot water heater in my building in Elsen [village in the city
of Paderborn], Germany where the headquarters of the UNRRA was, and they didn't. So
they took baths in my place and that's how | got in the JDC. Within six months | decided
| wanted to get out. And | came to the JDC, and they said, yes, they'll take you. We
need people in Munich [Miinchen]. And | left and came on staff with the JDC in Munich
[Munchen].

Interviewer: —Let’s backtrack a bit, now that you talked about the JDC. Did you, with the UNRRA, did
you have a specific role or responsibility, and was that based on training you had had
before, education that you had had before?

Theodore: What was important for the UNRRA at that time was to have a cadre of people who
knew the Army, because the UNRRA was under the aegis of the Army, and you had to
talk militarize, old buddy sort of thing, and that's why | was in the U.S. zone. Also, the
fact that | had a major in psychology and public administration gave me a background,
certainly not my Jewish background, for the work that they did and the fact that they
put me in the headquarters of the entire UNRRA, who at that point had close to seven
million refugees. However, there were only about 40,000 to 60,000 Jews, only 40,000
to 60,000 Jews in West Germany, Italy, and Austria, very few.

Interviewer: — At that time.

Theodore: At that time.

Interviewer: —§ What was the nature of your work there?

Theodore: Actually, it was called reports and statistics for the CEO, which meant that we had to
keep our pulse on the vast movement of people in Europe at that time. Who were all
these people that were moving? Trains were coming daily into West Germany from
Romania, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, dumping the "Volksdeutsch". Those were citizens
who had a German background and who certainly during the war didn't give much help
to the government that was supposedly theirs, and they were all thrown out. And, of
course, as it turned out, that was a very plus for West Germany because the people they
were sending were highly skilled farmers, people that later helped Germany in their rise
to power economically. But we were in constant consultation with many areas
apprehending people. The truth of the matter is the data that we got was way off, way
off, because there were more people getting on these trains than were on the books, so
to speak. And | recall now, my interest in JDC and the fact that there were involved in all
of this, Jewish Army chaplains, G.I’s. As a matter of fact, when | came to Germany, | was
housed in a town near Frankfurt called Hochst [Hochst am Main], which you've heard of
Bayer's Aspirin. Well, it was a tremendous complex for manufacturing, at that time, of
medication for venereal disease. And when -- there was one evening, a G.I. came up to
me and he says, "I know you're Jewish." | said, "Thank you." He said, "Would you help
us?" | said, "What is it I'm supposed to do?" He said, "Well, we're trying to help Jews.
We're trying to help Jewish refugees come in from the East." So | said, "Well, how are
they coming?" And he told a story of all this great movement of people, hundreds of
thousands, that there was an underground, moving people out of Eastern Europe,
staffed by what was called the Brikha, which were Palestinian Jews, it was a brigade
stationed in Italy. And what Palestine did -- what the Jewish agency did was to draw out
of the ranks from the brigade and establish this organization and bring from Palestine
others to replace them in the brigade, so that the British Army didn't know that there
had been a movement. So there were dozens and dozens of these Palestinian Jews, all
picked for what it was they had to do. And with all the trains coming in, there would be
additional box cars added at the end with Jews in it, Jews who wanted to flee Eastern
Europe. And it was especially in rows after the Kielce pogrom, dozens of Jews in Poland
were shot, the exodus started. And so this young man said, "Look, we're going to have
to pick up some people who are coming in and they're at a rail center outside of
Frankfurt. We're going to have a truck and we're going to go get them." | said, "| can go
along." And that evening we got in the truck; there were three trucks. And we drove to
this area, and we stopped in front of a bunker. It looked like a bunker. He says...
actually the top was all bombed because it was a railroad station. He says, "In this
bunker we're going to find Jews. On the other hand, there are going to be many non-
Jews there." | said, "Well, how do | tell the difference?" "Oh," he says, "you say two
words. You say ‘Joint' and you say 'Amkhah' which is Hebrew for friend." And we
walked down about twenty stairs into this bunker and it was a tremendous area filled
with people. It was dimly lit and you could hardly tell, children were crying. You could
hardly move through the people, and both of us started from both sides and saying
"Amkhah, Joint." And it was as if the words were magnets and the people were made

out of steel. Slowly they got up, didn't ask a question, and followed us out. | was so
overwhelmed by those two words and the experience; | wanted more than ever to get
into JDC. And eventually, | did.

Interviewer: That's quite a story. You started to talk about this mass movement of people across
Europe, and you mentioned, at least some of them were. Can you expand on that a
little bit?

Theodore: When our people were freed from the camp, their first impulse was return home. And
it wasn't difficult because trains were moving. They got a ride, just like my wife, and she
was in a group who were walking towards Dresden, and when the war was over she also
decided to go home. So you had tens of thousands of Jews moving back home. But
when they got there, there wasn't much. The homes were bombed. None of their
friends were back.

Interviewer: You're talking about the movement of people across Europe in 1945. And I'm trying to
get a sense of who those people were.

Theodore: First of all, you must remember that the Germans had taken hundreds of thousands of
people as slave laborers. They weren't Jews. They were just criminal -- no, | shouldn't
say. There were a few criminals. They just took anybody. Or they took certain skills,
and picked them up and put them to work, Hungarian farmers, Romanian tailors. They
had the best system of being able to move people about for their purposes. And they
moved them. And they used them. Schindler's, after all, those people in there. So you
had those that were moving westward to their homes, and, from among those in
Germany, they were going eastward back to their countries. But let me get to our
people. Because of this, because there was no control, because the police and the
military couldn't care less if another train -- Jews were able to come out easily into
Western Germany. Why Western Germany? Because there were the camps. There
were a lot of camps that had been set up and, indeed, were beginning to close down
because of the movement, the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of people.

Interviewer: You're talking about a displaced person's camp?

Theodore: Yeah. We had, even in the early days of my UNRRA experience, people responsible
didn't understand what was happening. They didn't understand that there was a
movement taking place that they had no control over, because -- and, also, because of
the friendly officers of the UNRRA who wanted to be helpful, especially because the
commanding general was Eisenhower, and he had seen how unhappy President Truman
was when we complained about the bad accommodations that Jews had in Germany as
compared to what the Germans had. And there was a group headed by a fellow of the
name of Harrison who came and said it's true. The gentiles were living much better
than the Jews who had come out of the concentration camp. So we were able to bring
all these people in them. I'm talking about the Brikha. So that the 30,000, slowly, in the
period of 1946, and 1947, and 1948, rose to about a quarter of a million. Now, the
general opinion is that those that we were serving had all been in camps, had come
without anything, and were sick. They needed nourishment, it was true. Those who

had been in camp needed that. But what this movement was bringing was altogether
different. You were getting Jews who had lived in the underground. They called it
uboat [?]. There were Jews who were in the partisan, hundreds of Jews. There were
Jews who were fleeing from Poland and Bucharest and Hungary. And then the last
group and the most important group were Jews from the Soviet Union. Jews who
deserted the Russian Army. Jews who had an opportunity of leaving and they took it.
And so, therefore, the group we were working with were not those who couldn't take
care of themselves. On the contrary, those who came brought strength to the -- those
who had been in camp. For example, we decided very soon -- it could very well have
been that they decided it for us -- to set up a self-government. Many of the Jewish army
chaplains were very much involved in that. Now, the chaplains were into Germany
earlier than we were. We didn't come in until the middle of June. They were there
before the war ended. And some of them were very aggressive and saw immediately
the need for self-government and a self-government was set up. The chairman at that
time was a man by the name of Blumowitz who later became the Surgeon General of
the Israeli Army. We're talking about people with capacity. There was a man by the
name of Retter who later became an aide to Golda Meir. A Mr. Piegoch [?] became a
number two person in the Mapai party. So we were dealing with people who were
responsible, who were able to act, who did what we couldn't do. We could come into a
camp and we had our people in camps. But when it came to running the camp, they
were running it. They -- we must forget about it being a camp. We thought of it as a
village. There was a mayor. There was a police force. There was a fire force. There
were kitchens. There was garbage collection. They were all Jews. So what we were
dealing with, really, were people who were responsible. And as we brought in our
supplies in those early days, the division was made directly to the camp. They made the
distribution. They were our armed knights.

Interviewer: Question, just for the record, who are we talking about now when you say we?

Theodore: Talking about Joint.

Interviewer: Okay.

Theodore: That Joint. And so there is another element. For example, | noticed in the document
the Museum put out recently about the history after the war. | noticed that it said that
on June -- or in June, the JDC was admitted in order to set up a welfare program. That
was true, but it didn't go far enough, because the history of the DP camps has never
really been told. How to come to grips with a group who have been through the
Holocaust, lost their families, were living in, the best | could say, in substandard housing
in the camps, even though some of them were villages, how could they come out of that
trauma? What -- how could they get up every day, having lost their families, living in
these wretched conditions? Okay. They were given food, clothing, and so on. It was
mind boggling that they did so well. For example, we brought in three psychiatrists and
sent them to the largest camp, which was in Pocking, where there were 14,000 Jews in
one camp. And we brought them over for a purpose. We weren't sure what did we
need for Palestine. What did they need in order to care for the possibility of large-scale
mental breakdowns? Because after all, there was a lot -- we knew were going to

Palestine, then Israel. What would they need? What would we need? We -- and I'll get
to our program in a moment -- and after a month there, they came up with the
following. They examined about 400 people. And they came to the following
conclusion, that the percentage of people who would break down or who would need
hospitalization would be no different than in a normal society. That was it. And that
was true. We had a few, a few dozen out of a quarter of a million having to be
hospitalized, but the majority wouldn't. Whether it was because of the strength of
anyone who had survived, but it was also a point that we came to the conclusion that
something was happening. It wasn't that we were talking to all the people or it wasn't
that the central committee, which was our group, and incidentally, the army gave them
a liaison officer. They had a full colonel as a liaison officer from Frankfurt who didn't
speak a word, other than English, and so we were very good friends. What was the
name? Colonel Sivers, from the South. And suddenly -- it was sudden -- one day we
said, you know, there's something changing completely. The social workers began to
talk to us about the paring-offs that were taking place in camp, looking for new life. The
result was something that we will never forget. At one point -- well, first of all, we
brought in wedding rings, sent a jeep down to Milan. They bought wedding rings.
Everybody got a free wedding ring. Number two and most important was that we said,
look, we better get as many diapers as we can because we're going to be full and need
it. And | recall in early 1948, we had a -- someone made some statistics. They said that
every woman between the ages of eighteen and thirty was either pregnant or had had a
child in the previous six months. This rebirth, this -- the rose growing in a garbage can,
people who looked so unfit were changing. And so there was a miracle. There were the
children. And with children, you had to change a lot of programs. We had doctors, and
never mind the question of diapers, special foods, and the whole gamut. And the camps
changed completely, because with the children, what else did they need? The people in
the camps to have a village. Papers, there were at least a dozen Jewish papers that
were published. And also, the -- there was no Yiddish type, so they were phonetically
English words. In the book | gave you, you'll see. Kindergartens, new thing. They
opened up kindergartens. We were involved in a very famous Jewish actor by the name
of Yabakoff [?]. | noticed it in the paper the other day. The comedian, we brought him
in. We brought in Yiddish -- there was one place that had a lot of Yiddish movies. We
brought that in. We brought in all kinds of athletic stuff for the people. Most
important, one | can't forget, that it was difficult for the Army to understand the Jews.
After all, in dealing with the military government, dealing with the Germans who were
clean, precise, and work on time, who would say, "Yah," every time the question was
asked. Our people never said yah. They were independent. And it was hard for the
Army to understand, they had to be responsible, but they couldn't. And so there were
all kinds of rumors that the Jews were lazy. They didn't want to work. That they were
just eating -- doing nothing, forgetting -- forgetting that not one of our people wanted to
stay there. This was the bloody earth of Germany. And they were there by sufferings.
And the minute they had an opportunity of getting out, illegally or legally, they went.
But the commanding general said, look, these people are doing nothing. So we set up a
work, It was called produktiveassersia [?]. A word for us. We brought in material. We
had so many tailors. The ORT expanded. | must say that with the tailors, we had a
funny experience with one group because we had some very bright people; after all
there were Jews from tddz, an area where clothes were made. And so we found that

you figure out on a piece of material you can make so many suits, different sizes. And
we found, much to our dismay, that this one place was making only small sizes and
keeping the rest of it, making big sizes and selling it for the committee to be used in the
religious activities. But we thought that was fine. So we put people to work. And all
during this time there was the underground going to Palestine. We were involved. We
were involved. The number of gallons of gasoline that somehow or other went out of
certain trucks to other trucks, made it available for them to move down to Italy and to
France. And there was, the UNRRA knew about it. The British wanted to stop it, but it
continued. It was the only thing that kept the spirits of the people, knowing that they
could leave. And it was our responsibility to carry on this vast program, not just welfare,
but from the cradle to death. And the committee ran everything.

Interviewer: |The central committee.

Theodore: The central committee, which incidentally was established based on the political
schlussel , political key, as there was in Palestine. And you had the Agudath. You had
the Mapai. You had the Mapam. You had the political methodology, which permeated
all the way into Eastern Europe, because those that went were out of certain political
parties, and they found that they could organize groups coming out by having this
additional tie. Well, we certainly tried to do what we could in order to help them.
Besides the food, we were also a good tie to the military. For example, when the state
of Israel was founded, then there was normal immigration to Israel, except for one
thing. The British Army insisted that there should be no one of military age sent. Cruel.
Terrible. | don't want to —

Interviewer: — In 1948?

Theodore: Yeah, sure. The British had their hand in everything. After all, the heads of the UNRRA
and the IRO were all British generals, and who were they talking to? They were talking
to their home office who, of course, didn't want immigration to Palestine and even to
Israel. And there was one time, | don't want to mention who was involved, but | talked
to some of the people, others did as well, that how cruel it was to separate families at
this stage and this period after the war. And the result was very interesting. The person
who said he was going to examine the train, said, | will only examine the left side of the
train. | want all the women and children there. What you put on the right side -- | don't
care. I'm not going to look at it. Because | have to certify that | have seen this train and
only women and children have gone. And so there you were. The person examined the
left side. And on the right side, of course, were the husbands and the wives -- the
husbands and the kids of military age. And it went. And then finally when IRO closed
out, they decided that everyone could go. The -- let me talk about the ship Exodus. You
remember, the ship that was sent back to France, came to France, and the people didn't
want to get off. They were on a hunger strike. It really wasn't, because at night, Herb
would know, boats were sent to put food on, and the people ate. The ship was sent
back to Hamburg. And all the people were offloaded and sent to a camp called Bergen-
Belsen. Within one month, every person who had been on the Exodus was on his way
back to Palestine in the underground. British, no British, the valor of the people who
were handling this was tremendous. But let me try to give you a picture of what it was

like, what it was like sitting in the office in Munich [Munchen], a ------ of three, across
the street was the central committee and they had a very fine villa which the Army had
given them. And next there was a long street nearby called Mohlstrasse. The area was
a very fine area of homes which had been taken over by the Army and so on. There
wasn't a day that there wasn't an incident, either with German police, our people were
in black market. We couldn't blame them. After all, they had been victimized. If they
had a possibility of making a few dollars, let them make it. We, also, were in the black
market. It cost two cigarettes for a box seat in the Wagner Opera House around the
corner. The director was a man by the name of Solti, the present Sir (Georg) Solti. So
this -- this is how things worked. The committees had their purpose. It didn't always
parallel ours. For example, they were so strong, they felt that the tremendous
warehouse we had with millions of pounds of food and clothing and cigarettes ought to
be under their control. You know, if you're a political group, you don't stand still. You
try to go forward by seeing what you can gain, like politicians anyplace. And the former
director, a fellow by name of Leo Schwartz, who is an author, he was willing to turn it
over to them. And we thought that would be unpalatable, then we would have no
control. And so the contract was signed by them, and then sent to Germany. | took one
look and | put it in a safe, locked it up, and | called Herb, and | said, "Herb, we can't sign
that, because that would be giving over to the committee things that our board certainly
wouldn't want." And sure enough, that's what happened. We never gave it to them.

Interviewer: | need to ask you a few questions.

Theodore: Sure.

Interviewer: To clarify this for people who don't know exactly what your role is and there are certain
terms, like the central committee that you sort of explained, but | think that we need to
be a little more specific sort of for those who might watch this. When you went to work
for the Joint -- the American Joint Distribution Committee, what was your role and what
was your function? You keep, also, referring to Herb, so | need to -- some of us need to
understand this.

Theodore: Yeah. | was brought on as the deputy director for our program in the USO in Germany,
which means | was the number two man in this program. | had specific tasks. From an
administrative point of view, with personnel, with administration, | had a responsibility
for liaison with the UNRRA and the leader of the IRO, and for liaison with part of the
military. | also visited the camps to observe and to report where we might find things
easier to do, and to determine that our food and clothing was properly distributed. We
had a problem at the outset because it wasn't -- we came in, in 1945, but by the time
our supply lines -- yes, we sent trucks up to Sweden and brought back food, but that was
a fly in the bucket. You needed large -- in order to take care of a group of a quarter of a
million, you needed a large warehouse. You needed a lot of trucks. You needed a lot of
staff. You needed security. We had -- the Army gave us two dozen rifles and told us to
train our own group for guarding our supplies. Also, not only security, but there was a
great deal of thievery -- couldn't blame them. After all, if you put one carton of
cigarettes and try to hide it, you were ahead $50. So this was a constant problem we
had of security. Also, in setting up the program we had a lot of new people coming in,

and | was responsible for placement and for all of the factors that go in to have a
running organization. It was -- Leo Schwartz, he's written a number of books, was busy.
The director is busy. As director, you had to be constantly perdue [?] with the
committee and with the Army and with the UNRRA, and he took over that role. We
were constantly thinking of new programs to be helpful to our people within the needs
that were demonstrated. We also were doing our best to save money. We did. The
archives will show that one of the most important foods that we had was cigarettes.
We were able -- not we, but there were some over at the central committee, they could
tell you the number of calories a pack of cigarettes would buy. The Army in its infinite
wisdom allowed the G.I’s APO privileges. They didn't tell them they couldn't bring in
cigarettes. So millions of cigarettes were coming in through the Army. The Army knew
about it. And finally, eventually, only in 1948 did all this end, so that was three years,
when they had what was called a currency reform. They took the Reichsmarks, which
were about 500 to a dollar, and converted it to Deutsche Marks. At that point, Germany
opened up. Instead of keeping hidden what had been manufactured and not sell it for
the cheap Marks, they were willing to sell it for the Deutsche Marks. And it was true;
the Deutsche Mark did get strong. It was as if from one day there were no flowers, and
the next day there were peonies all over Germany. And we had to be very sensitive to
all of this in what we were distributing during that period. And we were able to -- I'm
sort of walking through one area that | was involved with. We convinced the Army that
we ought to have a distribution of cigarettes to the workers, because their salaries were
small, and they certainly were smoking. We always talked about smoking. And I'm
sorry | didn't take a copy of it, but the Army put out a directive in which we were
mentioned about the distribution of cigarettes to working mothers, to workers. And
what developed was that instead of spending the budget, we didn't. And the money
that was saved, and it was into the millions of dollars, were used to help buy the ships
that took people to Palestine and Israel. And so we were a very integral part of that
whole picture. | must also say a personal thing. When | told my sister that | was -- my
sister, Sara, who was the head of the Pioneer Women, that | was going to go to work for
the Joint, her immediate reaction was, "Ted, how could you go to work for a non-Zionist
organization?" | said, "Sara, they've changed." She says, "If you tell me so, that's fine."
And we did change. We were more involved in these areas. As a matter of fact, in 1948
we opened up an organization in Israel that took over the responsibility from the
government of Israel of all the handicapped, the elderly, and sick children that were
immigrating to Israel. Just think of it. We hade a caseload. We've built hospitals. If we
hadn't, people wouldn't have moved out of Germany. So it was important for us to
establish these institutions and run them, run them. We took it off the back of Israel.
Eventually, in 1955, they took it over. And so, getting back to what | was doing. |
rambled a little bit there. We were always on the alert for two things, protecting our
people from the Army. It sounds strange, but, you know, if you have a military
government and you have military police, and you're responsible for security in an area,
and you have these lovely Germans who don't fight, who don't make any trouble for
you, who say yes, and who go about their business, and you have these hundreds of
thousands of DPs who want no part of the Army, who don't think that they should have
to be disciplined by the Army, but the Army said if there's black market, we're
responsible. And there are always a lot of people who felt, well, if something goes
wrong, it's probably the DPs down the road. It wasn't true. And to our people who

were there in such an important role, to explain exactly what was happening. And |
think we were successful to that end. But if it hadn't been for President Truman with his
directives, we would have had a much more difficult time. And this was constantly one
of the things that concerned us all the time, because people coming into the camps,
they were coming in illegally, and the Army doesn't like illegal things. They don't like
that -- the border between Czechoslovakia and Bavaria is porous, as far as the Jews
were concerned. So this was always a problem. And incidentally, because of the
realization that it was a problem, the headquarters of the Army in Frankfurt, under
urging by many agencies in the States, had an advisor in Jewish affairs, the commanding
general. Some very important people were there, Judge Leventhal of Philadelphia,
Rabbi Bernstein, and they were a buffer between the Army at the top level where there
was probably more interest and more willingness to be reasonable than down at the
lower level of the GI who has a fraulein who keeps talking about how the Jews are
getting so much more than we poor Germans and he's in the military government, and
he has no love for the displaced persons.

Interviewer: — Explain to me something about this hierarchy that the U.S. Army was basically in charge
of the zone.

Theodore: Yes. There were four zones. There was a French, British, Russian, and American. There
were no DPs in the Russian zone.

Interviewer: | Then how did the UNRRA, the Joint, all of these other organizations fit into the structure
in terms of the possibility in working with the camp?

Theodore: The Army -- well, not really the Army, the United States authorized the UNRRA to work
in Germany. That's why they sent out that original document to look for staff, because
they knew that the Army could never, could never be responsible for taking care of
civilians, especially this difficult group. And they needed help. And they wanted the
UNRRA. And they were very pleased when the UNRRA went ahead and built their
agency quickly and took over because the Army was not able to. The Army, from a
medical point of view, was magnificent. You know, everybody -- they would make sure
that typhoid and so on and so forth, everybody was powdered. They could set up
medical things. But when it came to looking after the people, caring for them, the
needs that were demonstrated, they knew they couldn't. And, therefore, the UNRRA
came in. The UNRRA was given a mandate. There had never been an UNRRA before.
The Army had never had to work with a civilian organization. And a lot of them didn't
like it, which was probably one of the reasons that the picture | showed you with the six
generals, all of the UNRRA, that's the brass that was there in order to intercede. And so
the UNRRA was given responsibility of looking after the camps, maintaining the camps,
getting the food -- couldn't swim. You think of trying to feed Army, the ten and one
ration to children and to women. It was too much, really. But that's what they had at
the very outset and that's one of the reasons we brought in as much food as we did.
Then the military was also responsible for security. Now, security, anything. They
raided camps and were very much upset that the people were smarter than they. They
didn't know one DP from another. The Army, for example, rations, that's a good Army
way. There's a camp, let's say Wolfitzhausen [Wolfratshausen?] had 2,000, men,

women, children. They need rations for a whole month. They need so many gallons of
this and so many tons of this. And that was it. But when it came to the utilization of the
food, the Army didn't have any kind of know-how. They couldn't send in their own side.
So this was UNRRA's responsibility and UNRRA had to know everything. [End of Tape
One]

Tape Two

Interviewer: We were talking about the structure in post-war Europe and you were explaining about
the U.S. Military and the U.S. Zone and the UNRRA. Then, now that we've established
that the UNRRA needed to carry out a lot of what the military could not, how does the
Joint fit into the picture?

Theodore: Well —

Interviewer: | We should say the American Joint Distribution Committee.

Theodore: American Jewish Distribution Committee. Let me talk a little bit about voluntary
agencies and the dilemma they have in carrying on programs in disaster areas. It's
always a mess. When you have a disaster, no matter how well trained the people are,
somehow or another there are so many different groupings, the government, the Red
Cross. It's a caritas. Coordination is so essential. In Germany there was the army,
sacrosanct. They had a responsibility because they were carrying out -- they were
running the Germans, the military government. Their responsibility was to get them on
their feet. They called in the UNRRA because they realized very quickly back in early
1945 that something had to be done and they couldn't do it, or they didn't want to do it.
That wasn't their job. That wasn't why you became a general, to look after some
people. And so the UNRRA came in and was given responsibility for running the camps
with the backing of the army who brought in medical supplies, who brought in food and
so on, and they set up a system of distribution, and then, of course, hung around the
camps. Every camp had a committee. Ours were Jewish committee. We fostered the
central committee. We were allowed to come in —

Interviewer: Now using the term "we" again, and | know you were with the UNRRA and you were
with the Joint, so we need to be clear here.

Theodore: I'm sorry. | don't want to say we with the UNRRA. I'll say we with the Joint. The
voluntary -- the JDC is a voluntary agency. We were working in many areas in Europe
before the end of the war. We were into Italy. We were into France and Belgium,
Holland. However, there was some concern for whatever reason for bringing the JDC
and other voluntary agencies into Germany. The UNRRA had to ask permission from the
military and it wasn't until June that we came in, for whatever their reason. They had
many reasons, communication. They were afraid, still, that there may have been an
underground. We were told when we were riding in the jeep, never ride with your front
glass down, keep it up, because the Germans had put wires across and so on. So there
was the danger aspect, overexagerated, but military has to, you know, security is
security. And finally the UNRRA had to put into motion a portion of their organization

to look after us. Not that we were so terrible, but we needed housing. We needed
uniforms. We wanted to be part of the PX and, of course, that's where the army,
rankled with civilians, was going to the PX. What I'm saying is that at the outset all
voluntary agencies had a difficult time getting in. Once we came in, we were there as
agents, as part of the UNRRA. There was a department. We reported. We got
everything through them. They looked after all of gasoline, for example, permission to
bring in trucks and so on. So, this is where we stood. They knew our people. They
worked with us in our planning. They were protective of us because they weren't
having an easy time. And the fact | keep coming back to the generals. The generals did
a lot of scotch drinking with the generals on the other side to help smooth the way for
us to come in and work. Once we were in there, they left us alone. We got our PX card.
We got gasoline for our trucks. We bought jeeps and trucks from the army for -- they
were giving it away, after all. And so this was how we were there.
Interviewer: —§ What did you -- what is the work that you -- that the Joint did, how was it differentiated
from what the UNRRA did?
Theodore: UNRRA had basic responsibility for feeding, for clothing, medical, but there was low
standard. The average caloric menu was about 1,200 calories a day. That is not much.
And they were bad calories, as | told you. They were giving us the ten and one ration
that the army put out, which are numbered ten cans of Hungarian goulash or whatever,
the cigarettes, in these boxes. And so the level of food was very low. And, therefore,
we made provisions for bringing food in. They probably used their cigarettes for
purchasing, which is all right. The army didn't mind that, because whenever our people
were doing were peanuts compared to what the army was doing. So, you know, they
didn't make too much noise about it. But we went closer to the people. We went closer
to the people. Our representatives in the big camps sat in with the central committee
every day in the problems of running a camp and how we could help them, what were
those things that they didn't have that we had or could get. So we enhanced the diet.
We had a large number of TB's. We were the first to bring penicillin into Vienna and
into Germany. We were supplementing because the UNRRA was unable -- they didn't
speak the language, let's put it bluntly as that -- where our people would speak to us.
We could get to know more about what was happening than any UNRRA person. And
so we were sort of the cushion between the people and what they were supposed to
get from the UNRRA.
Interviewer: | What other ways were you able to supplement, other than giving them food?
Theodore: Well, food, medicine, clothing, a great deal of clothing, cigarettes.
Interviewer: Did you get involved in education or vocational training or —
Theodore: Oh, yeah.
Interviewer: — -- with this activity?

Theodore: We even printed a Talmud. Yes. Yes. We had Rabbi on our staff, two rabbis, as a
matter of fact. We had an educator on our staff. We brought teachers from Palestine
to the schools. Now the question is where in 1947 were you with children that needed
education? Well, that was a miracle. These were children who came from the East,
who had lived underground with their families, or were Russian and came in. So we --
as a matter of fact, | think we had twenty teachers brought from Israel. One thing they
had to have, Yiddish. If they didn't have the Yiddish, they weren't good teachers. Every
part of their daily living we, in one way or another, touched. And, of course, when we
set up our immigration in 1948, we helped tens of thousands of people to immigrate.
They used to have a term; the Joint is "unser Vater." The Joint is our rescuer. But that
didn't mean that they looked at us and we were living fairly comfortably. We weren’t
paid big salaries. | remember my salary was $7,000 a year. It was a good salary at that
time. But they weren't jealous because they knew that when they needed help, we
were there. We would protect them from the military government. We had lawyers on
our staff. We brought in surgeons for the TB hospital for operations. We filled the
camps that the UNRRA couldn't do. On the other hand, we were always aware of the
fact that a number of workers, that everything was functioning, and that the people
deserved better pay, or cigarettes, and we kept their spirits high. We were there. And
that they knew that the Joint could deliver. Many of them knew Joint before the war,
where we had operated in Eastern Europe for so many years, immediately after World
War |. So it wasn't like we were new. We were Jews, Jews. And they -- and | think we
were pretty good Jews, because we understood what it was that was moving them and
what it was that they wanted and what they wanted to do. And we, in our own way,
helped. We were a direct line of the committee who were functioning. If the Joint had
had to run our program with our own staff, we couldn't have. Where would you get the
thousands of workers in these camps who were paid, who were functioning, who were
delivering services? If we had set that up, first of all, we wouldn't have had enough
money. And many other voluntary agencies were never able to figure out how we were
able to work so well, because they came as strangers to whomever they were helping.
But when it came to our people, the word Joint was something symbolic with their
people being rescued and helping towards their future of moving out of there. And
when we told them about immigration, they saw our involvement with the underground
to Israel, | don't want to say they behaved themself, but they understood what was
happening. Not that they weren't critical of us, but never mind. That's a love-hate
affair.

Interviewer: | How large was your operation in Europe, in Germany?

Theodore: Well, on that, I'm going to give you exact figures because | knew you were going to ask
it.

Interviewer: Well, there were a lot of camps. | wonder how many of them you were able to become
involved with.

Theodore: Personnel, in January of 1946, we had 44 employees. In January of 1947, we had 294.
And in January of 1948, we had 560 employees. But that does not include all the
workers in the camp. These were people who were responsible to us, who were our

channel to the people. We had -- let's see, in 1946 we had 38 employees who were
from the United States. In 1947, we had 86. And in 1948, we had 110. That was our
staff.

Interviewer: | Where were the rest of them from?

Theodore: Pardon?

Interviewer: | Where the -- you mean the rest of them were the people from the camp?

Theodore: Yeah.

Interviewer: | can't imagine you going in with 44 employees in 1945. That's not many.

Theodore: Well, that -- we had decided soon on that recruiting in the United States was very
difficult. And we made a plea to many people about servicemen who wanted to work
overseas. And we got quite a few that way, like myself. And any -- you know, in the
beginning there were only about 30,000 or 40,000. Our supplies hadn't started coming
in. The best that we could do is work with the committee who were there. We found --
we didn't found the committee, we found them. And they were there. And they were
important. Without them, we couldn't have carried on our program, couldn't have.

Interviewer: Were you able to work with most of the camps, or just the larger ones?

Theodore: Every camp. Every camp.

Interviewer: Every Jewish DP camp?

Theodore: Yeah. Wherever -- yes.

Interviewer: And there were many.

Theodore: Yes.

Interviewer: Just for the record, when you talk about the central committee, you've referred to it in
many terms.

Theodore: Yes.

Interviewer: There were also committees at each camp; is that correct?

Theodore: Yeah. Let me talk about how they functioned. As | say, we found them there. They had
been helped to organize by a number of Jewish-American Army Chaplains. And they
accepted their role. They were serious. As a matter of fact, in 1946 Ben-Gurion visited,
and he was their guest. And it's interesting that someone was willing to put forward to
Mr. Ben-Gurion that the city of Stuttgart, if he felt that he wanted all the Jews to inhabit
that one city, they thought they could work it through with the military government and

the army and the Germans. He got so excited and so mad. How dare you bring up such
a thing? No Jew will remain here that should be in Palestine. But this is the committee.
They were thinking how can we? After all, there were buildings, there were factories.
This would be a good place and so on. The committee saw their role as a part of us, and
as a part of us. We met every day. We -- | shouldn't have said that. We met -- generally
the committee liked to meet at night, because during the day they were busy. And they
also knew that when it got to be about 12:00 or 1:00, we got tired. And it was at that
point that they would bring up some of the requests that they felt they couldn't pass
early in the day. But by the time we got tired, we'd say okay, another thing, another
thing. There was a mutual respect on their part, realizing, even though most of us had
never been in the Holocaust or the Shoah, yet they understood how we were working,
how we needed to function in order to be able to have our committee in the United
States accept what we were doing. And when they began leaving, things began getting
more difficult. We had to take more responsibility.

Interviewer: Were they responsible to committees within each camp? Were there also committees
within each camp, self-government?

Theodore: They weren't responsible. The committees in the camp were responsible to them. That
was the channel.

Interviewer: But each camp had a self-governing committee.

Theodore: That's right. All of them tied into the central committee. They didn't always agree.
There were arguments and so on, but it was a normal kind of reaction that they had to
each other. But when things got tough and when people began being moved around,
the committee was very important. Because at one point, the army or German
government said we would like to consolidate the camps, because after all, there was a
lot of all these people coming from the east that were living pretty badly and they
wanted to have these. And that was also a point where Jews were moving out. By 1948
and 1949, American immigration had set up -- or it began, based on what was called the
Truman Directive, that anybody who had been in camp would have a priority in
immigrating to the United States. So, that was the atmosphere at that point. The
committee, of course, would like -- would have liked them all to go to Israel, but not all
the people wanted that. They had -- many had relatives in the United States. They had
friends who were not Zionists. But when it came to committees that visited the camps,
they were all united. They all wanted to go to Israel.

Interviewer: So was the primary goal of the central committee to work with you and other aid
organizations to get what they needed for the displaced people?

Theodore: Yes.

Interviewer: —_ |'m just trying to understand.

Theodore: Yes. We felt that -- not that we didn't have our own experts about what it is that we
needed sent to them -- but we relied on their data and on their forthrightness as to

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335 17,
what were the priorities. We listened to them. And when we made a distribution, we
worked with them. So it was well financed by us. We felt it was important. We gave
them status. After all, they had status with a colonel from the U.S. Army who came over
every day, couldn't talk to them, although few spoke English. He would come over and
schmooze with us as to what was going on. And when there was something really
desperate, we did call the colonel. There were incidents once where some fellow
decided that the black market on Mohlstrasse ought to be done away with. And instead
of coming with the military police, they came with German police, armed, armed. It
came to us about five minutes after it began. One person had already been shot. And
instead of the military government pulling these police out, someone says clear the
street. It was two very long blocks. And they were right around the corner from our
office. And meanwhile, a crowd of probably 500 had gathered at the other end of
Mohlstrasse, at which point my colleague, Dr. Kahane, who died the other day, and I ran
out. And not knowing what to do, though we certainly didn't want to go to where the
police were, and when we realized that the group was slowly walking up the streets,
500. Nothing in their hands, no stones, no sticks. And the people looked at me. |
looked at them, and said, "Let's go." So down we ran to the group and we walked with
them. By that time somebody with a little more sense had decided that they weren't
going to start a third world war, and withdrew the German police. And it never
happened again. And that didn't make us exactly heroes, because we were stupid, but it
happened just that way. And so the army knew what was happening. All the black
market we knew, we weren't involved. It wasn't our responsibility, and the central
committee status was raised by the fact that they had brought about this reaction to the
use of Germans, because this was 1947, late 1947, early 1948. And it made headlines in
the United States. The military government was told in no uncertain terms that they had
done wrong. So this was the committee.

Interviewer: | When you started working with the Joint in 1946, what was the situation in the camp?
Were they pretty well organized at that point?

Theodore: Yes. They certainly were organized. We had not yet come to our full capacity of
bringing in supplies. Now, it was very difficult. You can only land in France or in
Hamburg. And for the army, for some reason, only landed in Hamburg. So we had to
set up warehouses, and there's pictures in this thing, because what we had we couldn't
make a full distribution to everybody. So we had to make decisions as to who got what
when, and that wasn't very easy. It was very cruel. But it was the best that we could
do, except that we did have cigarettes.

Interviewer: How did you make those decisions?

Theodore: With the committee. With the committee. We tried to assess, because not every camp
was the same as far as the UNRRA supplies they were getting. And so we knew that
there was some not -- just better supply officers in one camp than in the other. And we
knew just what was happening, and we made the decision on that.

Interviewer: Where did you get your supplies from?

Theodore: We bought cigarettes in Switzerland, some food, but it was all -- there wasn't enough.
So we had to bring it in from the United States. So that time in 1947, we really started
to get our supplies, and by 1948 there was a constant movement of supplies.

Interviewer: And was this mostly privately funded?

Theodore: All, all. Anything we brought in was funded by the JDC through the United Jewish
Appeal. As a matter of fact, yes, we got some money from South Africa, but this was all
JDC money.

Interviewer: Did you have specialists on your staff who knew how to procure supplies and do all of
this kind of stuff? | mean, it's a big job.

Theodore: Oh, yeah. Well, that's where the local people were so good, because they -- as |
mentioned before, the Germans weren't sitting by idly. The Germans were producing,
but they didn't want to sell. As | say, the Reichsmark had no value. You would light --
kids lit cigarettes with 100 Marks, and so on. We had some very fine people on our staff
and who knew where some of the stuff was and negotiations would take place, and we
would get it if it was -- and they also knew that we were willing to pay in dollars in the
States or wherever. And in every area there were eggs and butter and chickens. And so
each camp had its own channel of where to buy things. There was one story of the first
United Jewish Appeal mission to Germany, and it came in February of 1947. It was the
first airliner to fly into Munich [Munchen]. There were no steps so they came down a
ladder. There were 40 men and women, all dressed as if they were going on a hike into
the mountains, you know. Winterclothes and so on, and they came to see the
programs. And the leadership looked aside and said, look, we know what we're doing,
but the people ought to see what the UNRRA is giving. So, we again used a camp called
Feldafing, and we talked to the directors and said, we want the people to see the menu
for that day as published by the UNRRA, and we want them to eat dinner and breakfast
based on the UN nutritional menu, and don't deviate one iota. Give it to them. Now,
we knew that generally for dinner they would get two or three slices of bread. They
might get small butter. They might have one slice of cold cut. And they would have tea.
That was dinner. For breakfast it was black bread and butter and a little jam. That was
it. And he also said, we want to live like some of them live. Well, show us where they're
living and set up a place and ten of us will stay overnight. Fine. And it's true that there
was barracks [for] living there. So we took one second floor barracks, which was a
military barrack, and the bathrooms were a dozen sinks and so on. And we set up their
beds with mattress filled with straw, which the people -- but we did give them a lot of
blankets. And, of course, the windows we covered over and so on. They understood.
The morning that they were to go out there, | sent the fellow who wrote the document.
| said, "Go out there and see if everything is set." They don't want what we're giving
them. They don't want any trace of it. Just what the UNRRA is giving them today. Half-
hour later he said, "Mr. Feder, I'm here, but a terrible thing has happened, also a nice
thing." The committee felt that if they were going to greet and entertain the people
who were helping them, they ought to give them a nice meal. What's there? He says,
"Well, | tell you, it's a nice meal. There's chicken and there's even a piece of pork." |
said, "Get it out. Bring it over to the hospital and put it in their kitchen." "But they're

going to argue with me." | said, "Don't argue. Tell them we won't give them their next
month's ration if they don't." | said, "Let these people see what the UNRRA's giving
them." Well, it was the most successful mission in the history of the UJA, because what
they saw was honest. They saw what the people had been living. And then they also
saw a difference between what they had and what the people were eating, based on
what we had done for them. As they came to the camp, people were sitting outside.
The bus pulled up and these ten people walked out. Our people had never seen people
dressed that way. They thought they looked like bums. And when they were
introduced, these are the people from the United States, they looked at them, and they
kissed them, and they said we would never have recognized you. There's also a story
about Yahudi Menuhin and Leonard Bernstein. Yahuda Menuhin, very little guy, made a
terrible mistake; although, in his way of thinking, he was right. He came to Germany too
early. He came in early 1947 and gave a concert in Germany. Our people were roused.
They were angry; and the Jews should come and play for the Nazis. He asked -- let's see,
there's a military government, if he could visit a Jewish DP camp. And | said yes. And
they called and our people were there, and as they came up, they were booing him.
They were shaking their fists at him. No one did anything to him. No one touched him,
but he had a great fear. He saw it. When he came to Frankfurt, he told the story to the
then advisor on Jewish affairs, Judge Leventhal of Philadelphia, told a story, and says,
"Why are they like this?" He said, "Look, I'm not going to answer you. I'm going to
show you something." He took him over to the Federal Depository, and took him in the
basement in a --- where it was locked. He says, "Come look." And what was there were
gold fillings that were Jewish. He did say a word except, "Mr. Yahudi Menuhin, that's
why they did what they did." Leonard Bernstein was another thing. One day, it must
have been in 1948, the phone rings and a man says, "My name is Leonard Bernstein. Is
this the Jewish Joint?" | said, "Yes." He said, "| need help." "What is it?" "Well, I'm
here to conduct the Munich Philharmonic and there's a strike and the orchestra can't
come to rehearsals. Is there any way you could help us?" So, Sam Haber, the director,
said, "Sure. How many people are there? Let us speak to persons arranging." So it
wound up that we sent ten trucks to ten different places, brought the musicians in, and
they rehearsed.

Interviewer: | When he wanted to conduct the Munich —

Theodore: Yeah.

Interviewer: — -- Philharmonic.

Theodore: He couldn't get the orchestra, because there was a strike. So we made available trucks
to pick them up at various points and bring them to rehearsal.

Interviewer: | These were German musicians?

Theodore: German musicians. We decided, you know, by now he -- | can even remember one of
the pieces was a Ravel piano concerto for left hand, and he conducted it. Conducted it.
And after it was over, | said, "You know, we've been very helpful to you. We want you
to be helpful to us." He said, "What can | do?" We said, "We have a small DP orchestra

in Wolford's house, and would you conduct them?" "How many?" "Eleven." He said,
"Sure." We brought him out. He was in his tux. The hall was full, and thousands of
people gathered outside, the great Leonard Bernstein. | think it was “Poet and Peasant"
that he conducted. And | was sitting inside watching him, and his hands got so wet from
the tears, that he barely stood up he was so emotional. And “Poet and Peasant" never
sounded like “Poet and Peasant" ever was played. And it was over, and they applauded.
He came back. He pulled himself together. And we said, "You know, a lot of people
didn't hear you. Would you do it again?" He said, "Sure." And everybody moved out.
Some more moved in. And there he was, still crying. It was beautiful. So, when it was
over the people gathered around and kissing this man, hugging him. He didn't want to
leave. And he stayed there for another hour, walking about, talking Yiddish. And that
night we took him to dinner at the officer's club, which was in the Haus Der Kunst, which
was a large museum Hitler had built for the new German art. And the army always
takes the present. So, there we were, and it was rather obvious, an American Army
mess with an orchestra of ten people, a meal cost 25 cents. The director recognized him
and came over and said, "Am | being too forward? Could you play us a piece?" "Oh," he
said, "sure." He said, "Any Jews here?" [laughs] The director didn't know. He said,
"Yes." It was 10:00 PM. At 2:15 in the morning he finished. He was getting out of
himself all the built-up frustration that that day had brought him. I'm not talking about
how good a Jew he was, but he certainly wasn't involved in Jewish affairs, and yet that
was Leonard Bernstein. That was beautiful.

Interviewer: | need to ask you some more questions, which may be a little bit more mundane, but |
think they're important for information purposes. You mentioned the prevalence of the
black market in postwar Europe. Were you at the Joint able to make that work for you?

Theodore: Whatever we did was something that the army allowed us to do. We would have never
set up the program of distribution based on working and so on with a minimum to every
family, if the army and the UNRRA had not allowed us to do it. They knew we were
doing it. So, in effect, it wasn't black market. | mean, we just didn't take a boxcar and
say, here. A boxcar would have been a quarter-of-a-million dollars profit. We hada
case like that by someone, too. No, we didn't condone or allow or be part of it. What
they wanted to do was their business. We weren't there to police them for the
Germans or the military government. If the military government wanted to arrest them,
fine. But that was a gimmick, not of our making. The goal of all the people were to
leave. The number who were left behind finally in 1955, 1957, were small. They had
problems that they couldn't immigrate. Maybe they had a little business or whatever,
and that was our goal. The military government knew that if they were arresting
people, putting it on the record, they could never immigrate. And black market didn't
seem like a major crime in the world about us. So, they were very lenient on it.
Occasionally, they would have some, but nobody was kept from immigration because he
did a little black marketing.

Interviewer: I'm just looking at perhaps, if you were -- needed more supplies or different supplies,
there had to be ways to get those, other than waiting for them to come from the United
States. | don't know if you were able to -- you, as the system, for your own purposes
and your own goals.

Theodore: Well, we didn't deliberately, but certainly it took place. If a camp that got their supplies
decided that they would enhance the menu by fresh fruit and it cost them a carton of
cigarettes, they used it. We didn't stop them. But they were doing it. And that's how
the system sort of worked. But, look, the military were wonderful. At one time in
Frankfurt, in the main center of the city, the army set up a great big store, with two
entrances. One entrance was for the Gl’s and officers who could come in and be given
points for chocolate, cigarettes, soap, whatever. They got points. The other door -- now
this is the American Army -- the other door was for the Germans who could come
through with whatever it is they wanted to sell, Meissen [porcelain], china, cameras.
They brought it in. They got their points. The Germans took their points for their
cutlery or whatever, walked over to the other side and used those points to get what
the Gls had brought in, the chocolate and so on. The GI took his little points and went
around the other side and bought his Meissen. That was army sponsored. So the army
knew, but didn't know how to control that issue. But it wasn't considered such a
terrible thing.

Interviewer: | Now when you talked about your involvement with the Brikha and that you were able to
help them get soap, or able to help, | guess, get some money to them to do what they
needed to do, was that official policy or unofficial policy?

Theodore: It had to be official. We didn't do it on our own. Our people, as a matter of fact, our
director at that time -- | showed you the picture -- was Doctor Joseph Schwartz. He was
a great man. And the policy he had agreed with by our lay leadership in New York
certainly was from that end. We worked very closely together. | wouldn't have been
able to get tens of thousands of gallons of gas if | hadn't been told go ahead and do it. |
didn't steal it. We just weren't using all our trucks, and they gave us so much per truck.
The Army, deep down on a high level, understood, understood what our motives were.
They knew exactly what we were doing. They knew every aspect of it. And they were
sympathetic to it, because like that, they could have stopped us. And so we didn't set it
up. We didn't always condone it, but it was there. And in the final analysis, it was of
great help to the people.

Interviewer: Was it important to be resourceful in maybe not breaking the rules, but bending the
rules to accomplish what you needed to accomplish?

Theodore: It's a very nice statement. | agree one hundred percent. | have a story. One day |
received a call from the colonel. And he said, "| have a question to ask, and I'd like your
opinion." This was around Passover. But, you know, the Orthodox on Passover must
cleanse the house of the -- not of the knometz because you can't have it around. And at
some point if you have a store, your rabbi agrees with you to sell it temporarily to a
gentile. And so he said, "We raided the camp and we found three floors of ration food.
And the committee states the following: That according to Jewish law, no Jew must
have khometz in his home during Passover and, therefore, they brought all of their
khometz to this warehouse and checked it in, in order to come within the ruling. My
question to you is, is it true that for Passover, an Orthodox Jew must rid his home of
khometz?" And | said, "Absolutely. | do it, too." Dead silence. "Thank you very much."

Now, just think of what | did. | didn't say anything but give him a direct answer to a
question he asked me because he wanted no part of it, either. | could have said it
seems impossible that a thousand people would give their food into one warehouse.
And obviously this is a warehouse for -- | knew it was a warehouse for the camp where
they had food in it. But | didn't say anything but what he asked me. So that's when you
talk about being resourceful. Then there's a funnier one even. It had to do with a cow
in a warehouse. And the military had been told that somebody brought a cow into the
camp. And so they were, after all this is rationed food. They came in and were looking
for it. And they came to the warehouse. They went through the first floor. Not there.
The cow was on an elevator. It was on the third floor. So when they went to the second
floor, the cow went to the first floor. And when they came down, the cow was brought
up to the third floor. And that's how they had cheated the military government of a
cow, mobile cow. So resourcefulness was very important.

Interviewer: | assume it also was with the illegal immigration to Palestine.

Theodore: Oh, yeah. That was an experience which had so many edges to it. From Austria, the
quickest way, and there was any number of children institutioned, they had to walk
through the mountain about a mile, and they did it, children, women, men. And on the
other side, there was a truck that took them. But most of the movement was handled
through border checkpoints, through friendly border checkpoints. Also, the Brikha
coming eastward -- or westward went through Russian checkpoints. And they weren't
stopped. But somebody had been there before and had made a distribution of vodka.
You can just imagine the kind of planning you had to do and the resourcefulness of the
people who were involved to know that a train carrying a few thousand people coming
through. And they made check -- spot checks. When ours came in, they didn't. So
there are all kinds of stories of the resourcefulness of the Palestinians, now Israelis. And
it was -- the head of it was a man by the name of Chaim Hoffman, his Hebrew name was
Yakhiel [?]. He died. And | remember a month before he died, | had met him in Israel.
And he said, "You know, Ted, no one knows what happened there more than I. No one
knows what you guys did." Because one of the jokes about the Brikha is that everybody
was init. And it's true. A lot of people were in it. But basically they were able to
function with the funds that they received from us. You know —

Interviewer: I'm going to stop you here, because we're out of tape. [End of Tape Two]

Tape Three

Interviewer: You were talking about the Brikha and the spirit in everyone —

Theodore: Sure.

Interviewer: -- that had been involved. Now, were you, as representative or deputy director of the
Joint Distribution, directly involved with these efforts? How did you —

Theodore: Well, not really, because what we tried to do is to not -- and they felt the same way --
become too involved with the people who were functioning out in the field. So our

office was in direct contact with the top person, who was this man Chaim Hoffman. And
whatever it was that he needed or wanted, he would come to us; we to him. | don't
want to say it was like an army, because the people were functioning on their own out
in the field. And they all came to this point. It was about a half-block away from us, he,
who held all the wires in his hand. And we moved directly with him, for good reasons.
We were American. We shouldn't be involved in this. After all, we were in there for an
altogether different reason, to bring help to the people in the camps. We weren't there
to send people underground to Palestine. So we always -- our name never appeared on
anything. But their needs were covered directly between our office and his office,
whether it was money, whether it was gasoline, whether it was trucks. Although
technically, he was in officially, because the Jewish Agency -- remember | told you about
bringing teachers in -- they came in under the aegis of the Jewish Agency. So the IRO, at
that time, had him as part of a voluntary agency, with the Jewish Agency, for Palestine
wives [lives?]. And so he was there legally, and functioned from there with all the
communication that was available. But, you know, we knew where they were. We
knew what camps they were in. We made an effort to be a little more generous to
them. And they were generous to us. They liked to try to pull wool over our eyes, as
any committee has a right to. If they don't, | would throw them out. If they don't want
to argue with us and if they don't want to bring up plans that we might buy, gee, what
kind of committee are they? But there was one that we wouldn't take. We had a
children's home right down on border near Birches Gaden. And one day there was a
request that came up from children. The request was to build a ritual bath. | took that
into Mr. Haber. | said, "Sam," -- he was as religious as | am -- "do you think that children
need a ritual bath?" So we said, well, you know, they're asking about that, about $4,000
for it. So we went over to Chief Rabbi and said, "We had a request for mikveh at this
home. Do you see any reason why, or are there people living nearby who need a ritual
bath?" And he looked up at me, and he smiled. He said, "I can't tell you that there isn't
a woman down there who may need a ritual bath. But | want to tell you, if there is one,
I'll do everything | can to bring them up to the next camp where there is a ritual bath."
So it was not all fun and games, because sometimes there was danger in moving these
convoys through, because at one point there were some scattered shots going through
the French Zone of Austria. That was cleared up. But the majority, there was never any
real danger with all the movement of these tens of thousands of people.

Interviewer: Did you have good working relationships with other organizations, other aid
organizations that were involved?

Theodore: Yes. Well, with ORT and HIAS and the Jewish Agency, there were no problems. We
cooperated. We saw eye to eye. We had the same goals. There was never any
competition. And no one else was doing what we were doing. However, we had a very
fine contact with the non-Jewish agencies, and there were many. The Catholic Relief
Services, the World Council of Churches, the Quakers, International Social Service.
There must have been fifteen or twenty.

Interviewer: They were in the Jewish DP camps?

Theodore: No. They were in Germany. They were working in Germany. They were working in
other camps. And we knew each other, after all. And one day, and | don't know whose
idea it was -- | know it was the guy from the World Council of Churches -- he called up
one day and he said, "Ted, we are going up to Frankfurt to talk to the military about an
issue dealing with something with the camps." And he said, "I'd like to take a lot of us
along." | said, "I'd be happy to." He says, "I'm even going to put on my big cross, which |
usually don't." And we went up and we saw Lucius Clay, General Lucius Clay. And they
presented their problem. And he was sympathetic. And the issue was settled. And as
we went back on the train, we were talking. And suddenly he said, "Why don't we have
a voluntary agency set up, an agency of all three agencies, and meet once a month?
They have similar problems. And, if we want to go together, do it." And thus was born
a council of voluntary agencies that had a lot of clout. You know, it's easier if you go in
with a lot of agencies with different religions, rather than going alone. And so we set it
up and we were very careful to keep it on the right level, that we would all see eye to
eye. And | remember when | moved to Austria, we set up a volunteer agency there.
Whereas in the United States, the kind of kindredship and cooperation between these
agencies mostly was nil. But over there, suddenly, the importance of religion didn't
come into it. We were fighting a cause. And as volunteer agencies, we said it. We set it
to a commanding general or to an ambassador, that we are a voluntary agency. We
obey the laws, but we're carrying out the policy that those who have contributed to us
want us to do. We will not be in conflict with the government or the military. But if we
have a policy to carry out within the rules, we'll do it, whether they like it or not. And
so, you know, they didn't mind that because they were also a little concerned about
how things were going in these camps. The military government liked the fact that
there was peace in the Jewish camps.

Interviewer: You were talking earlier about almost a resurrection of these people in the camp, and
how their lives began again.

Theodore: Sure.

Interviewer: Can you talk a little bit more about how that came about and how long it took? There's
a whole sort of besides the physical rebirth, almost, of a lot of these people weren't
well. Had there been a spiritual rebirth?

Theodore: Sure. Well, let me start with right after the war. Everybody, | told you, there was so
much movement, so everybody was moving, looking for their relatives. We, on our part,
in all our offices painted the walls white for people to put their names up. And so we
had steady streams of people coming, looking. What I'm trying to get at is that there
was something in them that they had to look, that they might find, and there were few
who did find. And when they did, you would know it because it ended always in
screaming and shouting. That was a period, a period of unrest. They didn't know where
to go. They -- the organization wasn't ready for them. They accepted to be put into
facilities by the UNRRA, the underground was go to Landsberg, wherever, you'll get in.
And that was a period of bewilderment for most people. Where am | going? What am |
going to do? Despite the fact that he was living on the bloody soil of Germany, he was
very fortunate. He had a chavura. He had friends. He had fellow Jews. He had JDC

trying to help him, and he was helped. He was able to eat. He was clothed. He was
even given a job. But it was all temporary. They didn't want to continue. They didn't
want to stay in Germany. | hate to tell this story because it's a little off beat, but | must
say it. There was a commanding general in Heidelberg, who had been approached by an
UNRRA social worker, talking about the trauma of the DP’s, all DP’s in camps. And what
could the Army do from a recreational point of view? Bring a band in once a week to
give a concert, and this was an old general. And he says, "Tell me. You got men in those
camps?" "Yes." "You got women in those camps?" "Yes." He says, "So what do you
want? What more do they want?" And he continued, which I'm not going to say.
Which is -- was his opinion that somewhere, somehow, the normal reaction of people
being thrown together might end in something positive. That's one opinion. And he
was absolutely right. He was a dirty no-good so-and-so, but he was right, because the
camps -- whatever we did. We brought in movies. We brought in players. We
organized every part of their life, education. And also there were people with children
that had come from Russia; that had come from various areas. And we were to set up
schools and so on. And the chemistry began to take place. There was no matchmaker.
And as | say, it suddenly -- we were blind to it, fortunately not too late -- when the
committees began to talk about the fact that there were pairings off. And the Rabbi
was telling us about the number of marriages. And he said, "There's no rings." And
that's when we sent somebody to Milan to buy gold-plated brass rings.

Interviewer: At what time did this renewal begin?

Theodore: 1947.

Interviewer: 1947?

Theodore: 1947, because by 1948 we had these thousands of babies all over the place. And you'd
come into a camp -- where they got baby carriages, | don't know, because we never
bought -- but somehow they got baby carriages. And they'd come in the camp and
you'd see a dozen women pushing. And finally we said we better find out just what is
this all about. And we didn't get very far. The committees were noncommittal. And
said, look, they haven't anything to do. They see so much about them that's beautiful
because that part of Germany was absolutely magnificent. | hated it. | went over the
border to Switzerland, the same thing on that side. It looked good. None of our social
workers -- it was after babies were born that they had problems. Our social workers
never reported about what was permeating in the group, or who were getting married.
We never were able to figure out those who had been in camp and those that hadn't
been in camp. But my own feeling was that a great number who had been in camp also
married.

Interviewer: — I'm wondering; a lot of the young girls who had been in the camp feel they lost their
adolescence in teenage years, all of a sudden they were in the DP camps, and | assume
also having babies?

Theodore: Yeah.

Interviewer: — | wonder if this was a difficulty that your social workers and psychologists had to help
them, and | don't think these people were necessarily prepared for adulthood in that
way.

Theodore: No, now if we think about it, it could very well have been a defiance. The German down
the street two years would kill me. I'm having a baby. I'm coming back. It's funny, |
never thought of analyzing it or why. See, I've met people who were born in camp, and |
asked them what -- what did your family tell you about their life? They say very little,
very little. They don't want to talk about it. As a matter of fact, you know, there's a
whole organization of children of survivors who have problems -- not problems, but if
they wouldn't have had a problem on this issue, they might have had another problem,
a normal family problem, that might be. Of course, my wife is victim, and my daughter
and her thesis at NYU wrote, as a child of a survivor, in which she disagrees with the
premise of so many of them who had written about the problem of dealing with parents
who had been in camps. We also had Merita's [Merica’s?] mother living with us, and
they were freer to talk about what experiences they had, which was quite unique.

Interviewer: — Tell me how you met your wife. You're mentioning your —

Theodore: Well, we have only the Joint to thank. In 1948 and 1949, the JDC in its infinite wisdom
found in Hungary a group of Jewish medical students, about a hundred and some odd,
all of whom had a year to finish, to get their degree. The policy of the JDC had always
been immigrate, get out of here, don't go to school, don't hang around Germany,
Austria, Italy. It's no good. But for some reason, this was such an unusual group, they
decided to give them assistance while they finished their year for their medical degree.
In the case of my wife and a friend of hers, they learned that the Munich University
Medical School would give them more credit for their -- for what they had had in
Budapest. And so my boss, Mr. Haber, was persuaded to take these two girls to Munich
[Munchen] where they would finish their medical school in Munich Medical College.
And | -- there was only two, so | was made the social worker. And | remember exactly
what we gave my wife. We gave her a carton of cigarettes, ten boxes of skinless
sardines, a kilo of cheddar cheese from Missouri, and a hundred francs. That was it.
And so something unfortunate happened; that her mother who had tried to come
through the minefield had been arrested and was in jail.

Interviewer: —= Through what minefield?

Theodore: Pardon?

Interviewer: When you say through the minefield...

Theodore: Oh, I'm sorry, between Hungary and Austria. This was my wife came through that
minefield. And she was in jail, and she had no news. She didn't know what was
happening. She came to me. And |, through a number of people in the Joint and the
Israeli Embassy, was able to get to her mother, and to help her in food, reading
materials, and so on. So we became friendly. And before her mother came out, we
were married in Munich [Miinchen], Army chaplain. She always says that the best thing

the Joint did was give her a husband. And |, vice-versa. We have three children, a son in
England with two boys, two daughters here in New York. Both have two children, and
that's -- oh, yeah. | made sure she finished medical school and got her degree. And she
is doing research at New York hospital in White Plains in geriatrics. She also worked in
Switzerland in a geriatric hospital.

Interviewer: — The -- share the aftermath for the DP.

Theodore: Okay. During this entire period, starting at the end of 1947, 1948, there was the legal
movement to Israel. The United States came through with a new immigration act
specifically to help displaced persons from Germany, Austria, and Italy. If you were a
DP, you could get a visa very easily. So -- and also people were moving to other
countries like Canada, Australia, and in this period, we were also involved in
immigration, the movement was taking place. Camps were closing out. We come into
the early 1950s, where | think there may have been three or four camps. And then you
come into the 1955s, and during that period, 1952-1955, the Germans, the Germans
wanted to be as helpful as possible. | must also mention it was the period where there
were negotiations between the Jewish organizations and the government of Germany
on restitution. So there was a lot of involvement of Jewish causes.

Interviewer: Were you involved with that?

Theodore: We are part of it, yes.

Interviewer: Did Ben-Gurion call you?

Theodore: No. Moe Levitt, our director in New York, was the secretary of it. Wherever the group
came and | was, | was involved. Like we were on our wedding -- first, in 1952, and they
got to Sweden when | was called to come back because restitution was starting up in
Austria. And so the government was interested, really interested, because they had
been there so long, by making facilities they could get them out. And the government
was very cooperative. And they had -- there was a lot of building all over Germany. So
the few, by that time there was 500 or 600. So we began to move up. They were given
apartments. They were given pensions. And by the end of 1950, they were all out. So
that's how it ended.

Interviewer: —§ What -- how important was the DP experience in Europe and your efforts to help them
in terms of establishing foundation in Israel?

Theodore: Well, curious that the JDC's first program in its history was in 1914, when, let's see,
there was Ambassador Morgenthau, father of Roosevelt's Morganthau, who had cabled
that because of a conflict that was taking place, or skirmish, or war, that Turks were
making it very difficult for the Jews. And the first $50,000 that we raised went to
Jerusalem, and we've been there ever since. A program that was set up eventually,
Malben, was set up -- | came to that program in 1963. | helped close it down. But the
JDC was responsible for setting up and staffing and financing the programs for all of the
elderly, indigent, and children.

Interviewer: So the camp experience in helping people rebuild their lives and the development of
community again, how did that play into your future?

Theodore: Well, | think that the experience in the camps of these people was a good fundamental
grounding in what eventually they found in Israel, because the importance of the
political parties, the importance of free elections, the importance of a central being,
state of Israel, never been the state of Israel. That -- the experience, whatever it was, it
had its effect on the people. And the fact that many of them, the minute they came
there, went right into the Army. It was coming from living in limbo, which it was, living
in an area that they wanted no part of, where they couldn't put their roots down, and
coming to Israel was a blooming for their lifetime. As far as my experience is concerned,
| certainly learned a great deal about mess and housing and kosher food. And the first
thing that hit me when | was sent to Vienna, was right after the Hungarian Revolution,
about 25,000 Jews came across the border and came directly to our office, waited in
line. There were a few women who had dead children they were carrying, and within a
very short time that problem was well handled by us with the know-how that we had
had. And, of course, there was also another thing there that changed history. | haven't
mentioned that immigration was not an easy thing. Medical, you couldn't have TB or
other debilitating diseases. You had to take a security examination by CIC. Did you ever
watch a Communist Parade? Why? And it was not easy. It was easy to go to Israel, but
to go to the United States was a terrible time. And something happened in that they
didn't change at all. In 1957, a guy by the name of Nixon was sent by Eisenhower to
look at it. And he saw atomic scientists, and he saw highly professional people who any
government would take quickly. Look at what you save in having well-trained
professional people. And so Nixon suggested and found a loophole in the immigration
law where people, without going through the security -- although they had a slight
medical -- could be given a temporary entry visa immediately. And then the security
check will come later. People would go to the American Embassy and in a week were in
the United States. Waiting for visa under the old rules took months or years. This was
an exclusion. Other countries in Europe were also quick on the draw, would bring in
buses down to the border and take everybody that came from Switzerland or Holland.
And Nixon broke the immigration standards and allowed immigrants to come in easier.
That was at that point.

Interviewer: That was very late, though.

Theodore: No, no. That wasn't in 1957. So he has one plus somewhere.

Interviewer: — | understand that you -- when you were with the JDC and you had had contact with
Oskar Schindler.

Theodore: Oh, yes. Well, you must understand at that point in the late 1940s there were many
Germans who said they helped Jews. There may have been. And there were a few. But
there were a few students in the White Rose uprising in Munich [Munchen] who were
standing up and helping. And so we just didn't live with them. We just had as little
contact as possible. And one day at our office in Munich [MUnchen] in Sebra Strasse 3

[?], the receptionist came in to our director, Mr. Haber, and said there is a German who
wants to see you. Tell him to see Feder. This German walks in the door, tall, rather
good looking, and was wearing the usual Bavarian lederhosen. He had pants, hat,
feather, a vest with little flowers on it. And when | get up, put out my hand, Feder and
Joint, Schindler. And | said, "What can | do for you?" As | uttered the word "you" the
door to my office opens, one of my colleagues comes in, a displaced person, takes one
look at Mr. Schindler, screams, drops to his knees, kisses his pants, and begins to cry.
And he was incoherent. Now, | want to tell you, | had never seen anything like that
before, never saw it since, and | knew something was up. After he began -- stopped
gasping, | said, "What's the matter?" He said, "This is Mr. Schindler. He saved my life
and 140 other people." He smiled. He says, "Well, what he said is true. And | come to
you because | need some help." | was still speechless. | went in to Mr. Haber, and | said,
"Sam, here's one German you're going to see." And | quickly told him what happened.
He said, "For God's sake, bring him in." And he sat down. And it appears we had
received information about him, that our committee in New York was discussing what
they wanted to do for him. So we knew we were speaking with a man that was going to
be helped. What could we do for him? And, well, he needed help right away, because it
wasn't that he was starving, but he was in pretty bad shape. Well, we sent him -- he
came from upper Bavaria, Regensburg, | think -- no. We sent him home with a good
care package, and told him to be in touch with us because something was going to be
coming in on him. And it did. And it was very simple. It says the JDC has made a grant
of $15,000 to Mr. Schindler. Now, $15,000 in those days and today, would be tenfold.
And he wants $5,000 in Germany, and he wants his $10,000 when he goes to Argentina
where he and his wife, who was an agronomist, are going to set up -- not a mink farm,
but a nutria farm, going into business. And he said, "I'd like to get the $5,000 to pay off
my debts and maybe buy tools. And I'd like to come in periodically." Because | was
ready to give it to him at that time, he said, "No, don't give it to me." Well, | didn't want
to argue with him. Had | given it to him, he would have been so much ahead because
the value of the Deutsch Mark then was pretty low, at about twenty, and when there
are twenty Deutsch Marks to a dollar, and when he finished up about six months later, it
was down to ten. Okay. So, he kept in touch and came in, discussed nothing ever
personal about his wife, his son, his plans. He was always planning. And finally he got
all the money. And after about four months, decided to go. Then he said he's taking his
wife and he has a family he'd like to take with him. It was a couple and two women.
Okay. | went to the general, and there weren't that many ships going to South America.
And he finally got down there, got his money, started a factory. Nothing went right,
nothing. Anything he touched. Two years later Mr. Levitt was there. He came and
asked if he could get another $5,000, and if he did he could get this and that. Mr. Levitt
said yes. One of the oddest cases we've ever had. Anyways, by that time the restitution
was taking place in Germany. He made a choice. He said, "Look, | was also hurt by the
Nazis. They took my factory eventually away. | had invested a great deal in it." And so
we didn't -- hadn't an answer for him. We gave it to the restitution people. And they
were fascinated by it. You know, one case of a righteous German, and they -- | later said
you guys -- this went on a caprice -- you wanted to see all of his documents, which he
drew the buildings and one thing and another. And the result of all this was, all kinds of
important Germans, but more important all kinds of Germans, that didn't like him. He
got next to nothing. And he asked if he could come back to Germany to fight his case.

And we said we'd pay for his ticket. When he got there, he said, "I have a possibility of
really getting into something in building. | can get a concrete manufacturing machine,"
or some bloody thing. And at that point we gave him some more money, that, too --
And his lawyer helped him. That, too, went down. The only joy he had, and he went on
a number of times, was to go to Israel. There, those whom he had helped treated him
royally with hotel, food, liquor. He was with them. And they adored him, after all. But
there wasn't anything for him to do. He came back to Germany. And then he got into
real heavy bouts of drinking. And that's the end of the story. When he was buried, he
asked to be sent back -- not back, sent to Israel for burial.

Interviewer: In your dealings with him, what kind of man was he? What kind of personality?

Theodore: He liked to talk. He liked to talk. And he had so many ideas in the business field. It was
fascinating to listen to him. In some ways, | didn't want to say it, | had a feeling he was a
first-rate conman. And perhaps that's what was necessary to save those Jews. Or
maybe the Lord put him on the earth for one reason, to save 160 Jews, and then the
Lord left him alone. That, incidentally, isn't my idea, but it was told to me by the fellow
who played -- not told to me. There was an interview with him, who played in Schindler
in the picture, the -- what's his name -- Scandinavian.

Interviewer: Liam Neeson. [?]

Theodore: Yeah. And anyways, that was his story. And | felt comfortable talking to him, but | just
couldn't see him, because when you think of what he did in pulling the German Nazis by
their nose and keeping those people, no one -- no one could ever understand what was
the chemistry that drove him, or was able to keep him alive with all these murders that
he was dealing with. It beggars description.

Interviewer: Let me ask you a question. Your experience with the DP camps in Europe, did this have
an impact on you after that period that remained with you? Did it change you in any
way?

Theodore: The experience with JDC changed me. When the DP period was over, and | was sent to
Vienna, at that point it wasn't certain that the JDC as such was going to either continue
or expand, and the possibility of disbanding. And so | tried making contact with other
organizations, working in the social service relief field. And then, of course, fate had it
that there were plenty of emergencies that JDC had. And | was able to build a family,
and wherever we went, the family was with me. Working in Tehran, my background
was very important, because we were dealing with a poor group of Jews living in the
ghettos, without running water, without toilets. And we had to set up a program for
them. My experience in Germany was positive, very important. | could look at the 34
kitchens in the schools and determine whether they were functioning or not
functioning. We brought in staff to establish a substantial medical program; experience
there. Dealing with the people, which was the most interesting, because they were the
most stubborn people in the world, still are, taking after their brethern, doing my best
to organize the committee in Tehran, all of my finesse in Germany was called into play. |
didn't win all of them. But it was very satisfying to be able to do as much as the JDC did

in a community where eight years before there be a line on Friday in front of the
hospital of a dozen or more mothers with born dead [stillborn] children who had to be
buried. That ended. We cleaned up cemeteries where Jews who were Jews used to
live. So the experience was very positive and then eventually | was transferred to Israel
where all our programs were going, and it was exhilarating. And then finally back to
Geneva, where the headquarters. | was a deputy to Charlie Jordan for all of Europe and
North Africa and Israel. And 25 or so years ago, he was murdered in Prague. And by
whom, we don't know. They were trying to get documentation. They knew what
happened to him. They claimed that he had drowned himself. He was there with his
wife and nephew. Charlie Jordan, drown himself? It was more of being drowned ina
bathtub, which is one of the favorites of certain groups, and then thrown into the river.
And when we asked to be present at the autopsy, they said sure. The autopsy was done
at 7:00, and the chief doctor of the Zurich community and our doctor arrived at 11:00.
They did not see the autopsy. We did ask for some of the internal pieces and brought
them back, but never could -- he was obviously murdered. There was a book written by
an escaped security officer, Czechoslovak, in London, who said that the Czech police had
watched through night of glasses, how he was carried out of a home and thrown into a
river. But it has a peculiar ending. This doctor whom we brought in, the chief
pathologist, this was August, was found frozen to death in a park in Zurich. Now, that's
enough to push memories. Never found out. They insisted it was suicide. He was
drunk.

Interviewer: What do you think the greatest success of the Joint was, in your stay at the camp, not in
all your experience?

Theodore: I'd hate to pull one out. But | would say that our work in Israel, as probably the jewel in
the crown, because we in our way have done so much. We built the school of social
working. We established all of the buildings, and we had built half-a-dozen buildings in
this program of Malben, were all turned over in working order and was part of the
wholed medical programs of the state of Israel, all of these hospitals. Yeah, | think —

Interviewer: I'm trying -- what do you think your greatest achievement was in the DP camps in
Europe prior to that?

Theodore: That we were there. Even if we hadn't done as much as we did, the fact that we were
there, that we represented something that they hadn't had for years, that we showed
them that Jews in the world hadn't forgotten them, wanted to help them, and that their
lives in the future would be more or less what it was before the war. And, you know,
how often in that period, walking into a camp, not that, you know, people were running
up and kissing their hands, on the contrary. | use humor with our people. And |
represented something so solid. And | was a big guy, too. And that we listened to them.
We didn't tell them. We listened to them, and were part of them. And | suppose that
giving courage to so many people might have been the greatest thing the JDC did.
There's, in that respect, there was the leader of the Jewish camp in the British zone of
Germany, it was Bergen-Belsen, and the leader was a fellow by the name of Rosenzaft,
was his name. And they spoke a little English. How he learned English, | don't know.
And so they brought him in 1945 -- after all, here is a man that came through and he

was present -- DPs and everybody's interested in him. And they brought him. And
Stephen Wise had him speak to a large group. So in the midst of the group he said some
unkind words about the Joint. When he was over, Rabbi Weis jumped up -- | think it was
Wese -- and says, "This is terrible. We're going to have to get the Joint out of there.
We're going to have to get another organization." Rosenzaft is listening, jumps up,
"Why do you want to do that?" So he said, "But you just told us about how inept (they
are) with the the problems." And he says, "Rabbi, you didn't understand me. | was
talking as if they were part of the family, and you have a right to be critical of your
family. But if you do one thing against the Joint, you're going to have trouble with me."
Now, what did that mean? That's it. He knew that we were there. He liked arguing
with us. | remember once meeting in an airport, and he always smoked cigars. And he
had this cigar, and he says, "I sent one cigar to your boss, Mr. Haber. If he would have
been a good guy, | would have sent him a whole box." So, there it is.

Interviewer: We have a few minutes left on this tape, and then I'll put in a new tape for the pictures.
Is there anything else you want to say here that sort of concludes this part?

Theodore: Well, | think that the epic period of the displaced persons in Europe has never been
adequately reported, and put on paper. It was a glorious page in history. If there had
been no Israel, which focused the eyes of the Jewish world, what took place in Germany
would have been known by everybody. And it was; it was a real valiant page of history
of Jewish life. No one expected that it would end as well as it did. Maybe that's another
thing. We worried with them. We cried with them. We wanted desperately to get
them out, and they felt that. They had never had anything like that before. And
sometimes we were stuffy, but at all times we were there to help. And they realized
that. And unlike most people who are getting help, they're ashamed, and they weren't.
They said, yes, we have a right to it. We were set upon and we're very grateful. So --
and | met many people since who had been in the camp, and many who hadn't, whose
life was touched by the Joint. And it's amazing how they remember, how Elie Wiesel
remembers the blanket that the Joint -- | mean, that is true. Another woman, the other
evening | spoke to a group of women who had been helped by the JDC. And four of
them got up and said, "If it hadn't been for the Joint, | wouldn't be here. | wouldn't have
gotten my medical degree." So | said, you know, "It's been a long time ago." She says,
"Yes. | didn't really know where to go to say thank you."

Interviewer: | That must be very rewarding to you.

Theodore: Pardon?

Interviewer: It must be very rewarding for you.

Theodore: Yes. Or we have a tremendous program today in Russia, and some of our people get
overwhelmed by being told by elderly people that their first meal after World War | was
through from the JDC. Or someone had been a farmer in the Ukraine who fled. The
farm had been paid for by Agro-Joint. Everybody remembers us. Fine. Although we
must have made plenty of mistakes. [End of Tape Three]

Tape Four

Theodore: This is a picture that appeared in the Milwaukee Jewish Chronicle in 1916. It is a group
of young Pole Zionists and there are two women in it that are my folk. The woman on
the left end is my sister, Sara Feder, who later was part and parcel of establishing the
Zionist Labor Women's Organization, The Pioneer Women. There were just two women
and seven or eight men. And the last person on the picture is a lady by the name of
Golda Mabovitch. Actually, that's Golda Meir. And she was the mentor of my sister and
friend of the family, and occasionally took me to kindergarten.

Interviewer: You can tape it.

Theodore: Pardon?

Interviewer: You can put a -- attach -- | mean, just year.

Theodore: Okay. This is the "War Room" in quotation marks of the United Nations Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration in Germany. And it's an enlarged map of Germany,
showing the hundreds and hundreds of camps where DP’s and refugees were living. At
that time, there must have been about seven million refugees and DP’s, who were
eventually repatriated or immigrated out of Germany. The tall fellow is a fellow by the
name of Feder, and Mr. Eisner to the right. And the lady is British, and her name is
Miss Rogel [Rugul?]. And every morning this map was visited by various members of
staff to bring it up to date and the fact that there was such movement taking place. This
is a picture of Golda Meir and Sara Feder taken at Columbia, Missouri. Golda was on
vacation from Palestine and came to visit her dear friend, Sara Feder, who was a doctor
of psychology at the University of Missouri.

Interviewer: The year?

Theodore: This is 1933. This picture is unique in the sense that it contains at least six or seven
British generals who were the head of the United Nations operations in Germany and
Austria and Italy. The British that took over leadership role for many reasons, maybe to
give them jobs or because they were fearful of the possible trend of Jews going to
Palestine. The person at the head of the table is General Frederick P. Morgan, who was
one of the ‘planners of the invasion and was at the final ceremony for surrender. He
turned out to be somewhat of a problem, because in a news interview that he gave a
few months later, he claimed that the Jews were fleeing Poland, coming with gold and
platinum and money and rich. He was thrown out after a couple of weeks by our own
Fiorella LaGuardia.

Interviewer: | Why are there so many generals?

Theodore: Yeah, they were generals. This is a very unique picture, taken in Munich [Munchen] in
1947. And it contains the leadership of the JDC in Europe and in Germany. From left to
right is Herb Katzki, who is still with the JDC. Next to Herb is Doctor Joseph Schwartz,
from Baltimore, Rabbi Schwartz, a great person. Edda Doych was in charge of our social

service program. And Leo Schwartz, on the end, was our director. He had been there
for a year. When he left, he wrote three books. And I'm next to Mr. Schwartz, Leo.

Theodore: There | am, and my favorite truck, a Bedford. He has a left-hand drive -- no right-hand
drive. And this was taken in Normandy. And I'm sorry | couldn't show you who's in the
open truck, because it would be of interest to the fact that one of the women was from
Norway and later became minister of social welfare. Any of us who could drive, were
told to drive, because they had to get all these trucks out of Normandy into Germany. It
was a great ride. | was thinner then, too.

Interviewer: —§ What year was that?

Theodore: 1945. [Transition to next picture]

Theodore: This picture was taken in 1946. The person on the right -- it was in a displaced person's
camp. I'm not sure if it was Feldafing or Wolfitzhausen [Wolfratshausen?]. The man on
the right with the glasses, | think was Frank London or Louder, who was a columnist with
the New York Post. He was visiting the camp. And we walked -- there were more kids in
this one, but he was taking because he had the longest payot (Ph.) of any of the other
children. And his teacher, the man on the left with the payot, was asking him to recite
from the Talmud, and he was doing it. Now, the question is: How fast did the payot
grow? Because here it was 1946, weren't even born. | must admit at that time, | didn't
ask him. But we assumed that he was in hiding in Hungary. And that camp also had
over 250 children going to school.

Interviewer: It's amazing that he was able to be in hiding and yet maintain —

Theodore: Sure. This is a visit by General Frederick P. Morgan. He's in the center there with a
white belt. And he's in one of the feeding assemblies. And you can see how everybody
is feeling very happy, primarily because the man he is talking to spoke English. He had
come down because of "we," the JDC, had protested about the bad housing in this
camp. And he was the gentleman who later was ousted from his post as director
general because of his comments about Jews coming out of Eastern Europe with gold
and diamonds, platinum and money. This is a memo to the leadership of the JDC, Mr.
Beckelman in Paris, and Mr. Haber in Munich [Munchen], signed by Oskar Schindler,
that he had received from the JDC $5,000 for needs in Germany. But in addition, there
was a sum of $10,000 that the JDC would give him when he went to South America to
establish a project there. [Transition to next picture]

Theodore: This was the receipt that Mr. Schindler signed each time he picked up money. You
notice, the name on the top is the name of the director of the Joint, Mr. Beckalman.
And then all of the signatures on the right are his. We tried to give him the money all at
one time, but he said, "No, | want to take it out in seven installments." And these are
his receipts.

Interviewer: = Okay.
