Q: Joseph, as we begin talking about the period after the liberation, I just want to make sure
that we covered everything that you wanted to before.

A: There was one episode that I meant to cite and I will do it now. In those first few days of
September of 1942, when the mass deportation started, my mother had been taken away.
My father and my sister had to leave our dwelling because the Germans who were
shrinking and shrinking the size of the Ghetto. It was hot. It was summer and there was
no roof over their head anymore so we lived in the street for about three days and three
nights on the pavement. When I finally obtained my father's permission to leave him for
a few minutes because I wanted to look up my buddies from the resistance movement,
something which he opposed for two or three hours, because he didn't want to lose sight
of me in case we don't find each other again or that one of us will be swept up by yet
another Razzia. I, walking down the street, I ran into one of the two fellows who a year
and a half before recruited me for the resistance movement Hashomer Hatzair. This was
Richard, we called him Rishak. He had the look of an insane person rushing about, and I
asked him well where are the leaders and where is our cell and he finally gave me an
address where I could find our company commander, a girl about 17. The word being
Gdud, and when I asked him where Simon was, the taller of us three who also with him
recruited me into the resistance movement, he told me that several days before the two of
them were caught by the curfew. They had managed to work their way homesby a few
minutes. The streets were deserted. The punishment for violating the curfew was often

instant execution in the street. So, the two of them darted into a store front and were flat
against the wall when the German gendarme went by. German gendarme, who paroled
the Ghetto most of the time in addition to the SS who used to come in for forays, for
selection, but mainly after 9:00 in the evening it was the gendarmes, you might call it the
military policemen. They discovered them and as Richie had time to tell me in those few
words with the commotion in the street and throngs of hundreds of people milling about
not knowing where to go what to do with themselves, waiting yet another selection. He
said when the German gendarme approached them and asked them what they were doing
in German, the gendarme turned to the taller Simon who was always the more combative
one, the more bellicose one of us three. He always felt that when the time comes, the
sooner the better that we should fight with whatever we had at our disposal. The German
gendarme turned to him and called him "Du verfluchter Juedischer Schwein_, which
means you Goddamn Jewish pig. Richard said Simon shot back and said you Goddamn
German pig, at which point the gendarme shot him between the eyes. That's how we lost
our closest friend, and at that point Richard, with his half insane look on his face said I
got to go. I got to look for my father. I don't know where my father is. So, I went back
to join my father and my sister in the street.

Q: Let me ask you one question. The years after that when hiding you were a catholic boy
when you converted, did you have any information or contact with Jewish people?

A: Since I jumped out of the train on the way to Treblinka in the first few days of September
of '42, other than sneaking into two more Ghettos, in the provincial small towns, which

lasted a few weeks before the deportations there started also. Once I was on my own
again, and later with the priest and working for the Polish peasants, as of November '43
going to east Prussia with new Polish documents and Polish catholic until the end of the
war, I had absolutely no contact with the Jewish people. I had no idea what became of
them except that common talk had it that they were all either having been exterminated or
they're in the concentration camps, and that there is a countrywide hunt for the Jews. I
did not know about the crematoria obviously at that point, but I had the foreboding based
on tidbits that they're either all exterminated or about to be exterminated.

Q: What about

A: There was no time to stop and think and deliberate as to what it feels like. The entire
focus second by second, minute by minute, day by day was on self preservation and that
meant watching my facial expressions, my 13:08:13 gesticulations, my "true story"
where I came from, my identity obviously changed as to my background, my schooling,
who my parents were, watching my speech. Because one could give one self away with
one word. Even though we were quite Polanized, coming from a certain environment one
accrues a lexicon of words that one doesn't even think about. Whether one be an
Irishman or a Jew or an Italian, every now and then you use a certain word which under
normal circumstances it is accepted and is part of the mosaic of life especially when there
are some minorities in the country. You don't think of that, but when you try to play
another role as it were and pose for someone else, one could give one's self away with a
word. I'll never forget by the time I got to East Prussia and my German was already

so-so because of exposure and because of my childhood where my father taught me a
little bit German and I was speaking German passably and I'll never forget when I spoke
to a German and I used the word for bread Broit. Broit is the Yiddish, Brot is the
German. Well, inadvertently trying to acquire as much German as I could in order to
speak to the Germans, | used that word Broit and the German looked at me and corrected
me and said it's not Broit, it's Brot. And I said yes, of course, but I almost collapsed
within me because I felt that I would give myself away with that one word. Fortunately
the German was not aware of that, but one had to be on a constant alert every second of
the day first speaking to the Polish population for whom out in the country I was the
"educated city boy." So, when they commented how good my Polish is, well he's from
the city. But also with the priest, Father Farkowski we had a number of sessions where
he would pluck out a word from my daily 13:12: lingo and then coach me not to use this
word, not to use that word, and taught me a new melody of speech. In other words, a
pygmaleon, he was remaking me right down to how to hold my lips together because he
felt that Jews by and large were more sensuous people and their lips were by and large
thicker. Many Poles so he felt had a thinner line of lips, so then he coached me that when
I'm not actually speaking to hold my lips together like this. In order to project a thinner
lip line. So, I was -- ever since those days when he started remaking my identity as it
were, for years and years after the war as I see it now, I have been groomed to play a role,
and that lasted for years and years after the war, until not too long ago, maybe ten or
fifteen years ago when I began to search for what is my own self.

Q: I want to get to that a little bit later. Let's pick up from when you were liberated. If you
can remember that for me.

A: Well, the day after the liberation by the American troops and this was Patton's third army
in Erfurt, Thuringen, which I was liberated the day after President Roosevelt died, which
I believe was April 13, 1945. A couple of the Polish fellows with whom I lived courtesy
of my boss, where he found a small room for five, six of us Polish civilian workers so we
would not have to stay in a labor camp. One of the two Polish fellows said to me to go to
the main railroad station, Erfurt, because that's where there were a lot of Americans. So,
we walked over there maybe a half an hour or so, and there across the street from the
main railroad station in Erfurt, there were a lot of G.I.s. In front of the hotel across the
street from the station there was a lot of movement of G.I.s so obviously it's hard to
describe how it felt. A mixture of enthusiasm that one actually not fully believed yet that
this was liberation, but it must have been because there were American soldiers all
around. It was warm and many of the soldiers were in a very friendly mood so I trying to
invoke my English of which I had had two years in the underground high school courses
in the Warsaw Ghetto, and I knew a fair amount of English because I liked the language
from the beginning more so than French and I started conversing with the American
soldiers. One word led to the other and they give us as usually after liberation -- skip it.
They give us chocolate and cigarettes and things of that nature and we were very grateful
and they said to come back in the evening and they'll have something more for us to eat.
When I went back there the second day, one of the soldiers introduced me to a first
lieutenant Preston. That lieutenant asked me, he looked like by the way one of the British

stars, David Niven, with the moustache, slim, tall very presentable, asked me whether I
knew German. I said Yes, I do. Do I know Polish, yes of course, I'm Polish, I know
some Russian. He said come on in and help us interpret because they've had a number of
refugees and foreign nationals and also Germans whom they were interrogating
apparently. So, I studied interpreting. I was then 17, for the American G.Ls. He asked
me to come back the next day and after some two or three days, they gave me a shirt and
the trousers of a G.I. uniform without an insignia so that within three or four days after
the liberation I was already dressed as an American soldier. My job there was ostensibly
as an interpreter and all around helper. I suppose some people call guys like me in those
days a mascot or just a kid who fell in with the American troops. Within about a week
later after I helped interpret for a huge number of displaced persons, Poles, Ukrainians,
Russians, goodness knows who else who would stop by that hotel simply because the
Americans were there. Help me with this and help me with that. It was a whole
movement of nations. Occasionally, they would bring in Germans and as I found out
later some got pretty rough treatment. They were moving out. This American unit and
they asked me if I wanted to go with them. Well, you might as well of put me on the
moon of my dreams because of course I would want to go with them. By that time I was
eating with them and the food was out of this world compared with the war time diet.
There was candy and cigarettes and everything else. It wasn't until a few weeks later
when my English started getting better and so on that I found out what that unit what. To
me they were just American soldiers. They were CIC. Counter Intelligence Corp of the
United States Army, and as it turned out this was detachment 220 of the 20th Corp which
was part of the 3rd Army, Patton's. So, I traveled with that unit. There were at the most

ten of them in that detachment headed by Major Lobb who I was told by one of the CIC
men a New Yorker or a Jewish fellow said that son of a gun, he was the judge who once
found me guilty when I had a traffic ticket in New York. Major Loeb who was a prince
of a fellow in contrast with one of his lieutenants who within I would say two weeks or so
made approaches to me, homosexual approaches that I frankly didn't know how to cope
with. In the best English I could offer him when he came into my room in the evening,
because wherever we went they commandeered the German hotel, I told him I was a
catholic and as best as I could that we don't do things like these. Because up until that
time I had never had any sexual encounter at age 17 since during the war in East Prussia
at age 15 or 16 there were simply no girls or women to be with. A foreign national, Pole
or any other non-German was under severe penalty to have any intimate relationships
with a German girl, which was unthinkable. Some who had and found a German girl I
suppose consenting were taken to concentration camp or severely beaten by the Gestapo.
That was to preserve the purity of the German race. So, I had had absolutely no
experience with a man or a woman. Within a few days after I was liberated and I was
with these American G.Is in a hotel 13:22:30 where they were stationed. One of them
asked me if I could play piano and I said yes a little bit and I sat down to play piano. I
had short pants. It was April and he sidled up to me and he put his hand inside my pants
and started fondling me as I was playing piano. This was a few days after liberation.
That was before I found out that they were CIC. To me they were just normal American
soldiers. Within a couple of weeks two of them had made advances to me. That was part
of my exposure to my great liberators and it wasn't until years, years later when I had
gone to Yale and acquired a little bit more street wisdom and exposure to the world that I

learned that as the saying goes the intelligence community not to mention the diplomatic
community is disportionately staffed by homosexuals. My experience in the American
counter intelligence, that's the people who liberated me within two weeks two of them
had made advances vis-a-vis me and I was 17. As we drove with my liberators -- and the
advances stopped by the way soon enough because I had made it clear that I didn't want
them. The CIC detachment followed the front line troops throughout Bavaria and into
Austria almost to reach Linz. As soon as the American troops occupied a city, the CIC
was there within hours and sometimes even ahead of them. Once we were caught in the
cross fire because we had marching orders to reach the next city and it turned out that that
had not yet been freed by front line troops. Wherever we reached the city and it went - -
we had 13:25: gone through Augsburg and a number of southern German cities and into
Austria, and I remember we were stationed for a while in Ried, in Innkreis meaning the
district of Inn and the town was Reid. As soon as we reached the town that was liberated,
we had four or five jeeps and in teams of two we had addresses to pluck out the Nazis
who had been on the list. So, this was basically the job of the CIC, that was to arrest the
more prominent Nazis, and I interpreted when I could. I have not seen any bad treatment
except one that who was detached from the first French army, a native Alsatian
Frenchman who despised the Germans and whenever he was interrogating them he beat
them up very badly. Since I didn't have to interpret I never wanted to be part of that but I
would hear from another room and he would break chairs over their heads and so on and
a number of the Hitler Jugend or the SS men caught were beaten up pretty badly when
they didn't want to answer questions. Eventually, by the time that our unit was
commandeered back into Germany from Austria, the CIC unit I believe was being

transferred or sent home so that I was taken by one of the officers to an MP unit, Military
Police, and that was in Augsburg, Germany, with the recommendation that the MPs could
use an interpreter. By that time, my English became 14:02: more proficient. I was with
that unit of the MPs being houses and fed and of course living with them and having a GI
uniform without insignia, for many weeks. This was when I gradually emboldened by
my liberation began to confide in one or two soldiers about my true background. That I
was Polish but I was also Jewish. Although by and large the Gls and MPs with whom I
was living and working were a magnificent lot of young people. They were mostly
draftees. They couldn't wait to count their points to be repatriated and to be released
from the army. To them I was a kid, 17 and Polish and anxious to help them and grateful.
They treated me magnificently. But, as the word got out that I was also Jewish, I started
experiencing a few incidents of anti- semitism.

Q: It was a noticeable change?

A: Significantly, I remember standing in line for chow, the 14:04: army meal, in Augsburg
where we were quartered. One MP sergeant with whom I only had a passing
acquaintance was in the line nearby and he started calling me the Jew boy. As it turned
out he was of Polish ethnic background from Chicago. Then, a time came soon after
when I was ordered to undergo house arrest. The lieutenant Dempsey I remember his
name a strapping, huge giant of a man from Kentucky who behaved towards me like an
older brother with no hint of homosexuality whatsoever, always protected me and liked
me. He told me that the major of the MPs, the provost marshall of that division, didn't

like Jews and ordered me house arrest for me. Lieutenant Dempsey the southerner who
loathed negroes, blacks, so much so that whenever I went out on the inspection tou
throughout the city, as an MP, an officer of the MPs, he was checking IDs and whether
they had a pass, and whenever he met up with black soldiers, he treated them
abominably,sometimes would lock them up. I asked him why he would he do that and he
said because I hate the blacks because they are garbage and they are the scum of
humanity, and I said but Lieutenant, as much as I was able to express myself, but isn't
America for all? This was my dream of America, equality, justice from outside looking
in. He said, yes, except for the blacks. And strangely enough, this was an MP lieutenant
who was magnificent toward me even though he already began to find out that I was of
Jewish background. But his superior officer, Major, also from the deep south, hated the
Jews, and after a while, when Lieutenant Dempsey come sneaking into my room and
bringing me something to eat, and I even needed permission to go the bathroom, because
the major the provost marshall put me in a house arrest for as long as he would deliberate
what to do with me next.

Q: What was the basis for house arrest?

A: That he didn't want a Jew boy to be an interpreter any more and he was trying to make up
his mind what to do with me next, and Lieutenant Dempsy would come in an sharing his
outrage but saying this was his superior officer. I can't 14:07:30 do anything about. And
strangely enough, a man who became a friend of mine for years later in the United States,
an attorney in Watertown, Massachusetts, an Irish man, John Corbot, who befriended me

also because he was one of the MPs. Strangely enough, he looked me up later when I
was in the hospital and would bring me things to the hospital and when I came to the
United States we became friends for years to come. So, that's another face of an
American soldier. But, I never lost faith in the ideals of America and I wanted to go
there, although I have already seen some of the shady sides of the face of the American
people as exemplified by some of the soldiers. Meaning, some homosexuals, some Jew
hating soldiers, and eventually I was taken to a DP camp in Augsburg which was a Polish
displaced persons camp.

Q: Let me interrupt you for a second. How you experienced this, did it make you question
whether you should remain catholic or admit your Judaism?

A: So, when I got to the DP camp in Augsburg, at the time when the population of the camp
had to be registered, most had lost their i.d. cards and whatever. I then had a talk with
myself because there was no one I could trust or knew what name I should use. My
official name was then Kutrzeba, which was the assumed name under which I got the
Polish identity card under the German occupation. When the time came to register at the
Polish DP camp, I was wavering what name I should use and despite the couple of
incidents of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I
was interpreting because of the major and one of the sargeants were anti-semites, I still
felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I.s that I met were just great and friendly
people, and I felt that I should revert back to my original name. Pride in my family and
my background, so I had given the name Fajwiszys, the original family name, but as the

weeks went by into August, September of 1945 and as I lived in the DP camp with one of
the American MPs, the one who became a friend of mine, stopping by occasionally and
bringing me cigarettes and candy and all that, I began to experience manifestations of
anti-semitism among my fellow Poles. It seems that whenever they talked about Jews it
was denigrating and Jew boys and I wish they got rid of all of them and worse. So, here I
was 14:11:30 in a DP camp with Polish population listening to a lot of anti-semitic
comments, time and again, with most of them or all of them not knowing that I was also
Jewish. This is no time and place, and I'm not a historian in order to make a case where
there was anti-semitism in almost any country, including the United States, and there was
some anti-semitism in Poland before the war, and the fact that there was six years of
constant barrage on the average uneducated Pole by the German occupying authorities
ridiculing Jews showing in the press caricatures of the Jew with the hook nose who is out
to rob everybody and cheat everybody and for a case can be made, but this is no time and
place for me to raise that. The fact is is that I began to experience almost daily
anti-semitic conversations. That didn't make it easy, and when I was asked about the
origin of the name of Fajwiszys which to those who know origin of names, might
recognize that it is a Jewish name, I would say that it was a Lithuanian name, because a
great many of Lithuanian names end is i-s. So, I said yes, it's an old family name from
Lithuania. Then, when word reached me that a Polish gymnasium was being formed in
Munich that one could go on with one's studies, I got permission to leave that camp and
repaired to Munich where I was accepted into the gymnasium. There was a Polish
gymnasium also in the DP camp specifically in the former SS Kaserne outside of Munich
where very large Polish dp camp had been formed. The Jews had another camp a few

miles away and I had nothing to do with that and I have no reason to look up anybody
because I was convinced that everybody I knew had perished. As I was exposed to some
anti-semitism in the American army and in the DP camp I reached the conclusion by
myself that the persecution is going to start over again. It's just a matter of time. I could
not imagine that a country that was known to be the most civilized in Europe, Germany,
at least 14:15 by some, launching a genocide with the whole world standing by without
that it would start all over again. It was just a matter of time, and I didn't want to go
through this again, now that I had obtained through some very difficult rambulations. My
new identity I thought I would stick with it except in the way that my mind formed itself
then, by then almost age 18, I felt that I should be proud of my original family name and
somehow fake the answers to the origination of the name. In the DP camp in Munich, I
eventually graduated from the Lyceum in 1947 an accelerated course with excellent
marks, and the question was what's next. I still bore my original name Fajwiszys. But
when I got to -- I'm going to start with something else now.

Q: I just want to ask you a question. I just want to a little bit about the conditions or the life
in the DP camp.

A: The DP camp in Munich was the former SS barracks but barracks is not quite appropriate
because Kaserne actually means a center, a military center. This was permanent brick
houses with long halls and large rooms where there were double bunks. Life was fairly
miserable meaning extremely skimpy food rations, watery soup, barely enough to sustain
a person. As children meaning high school students, we would supposedly get a little

more, but I was convinced that there was so much corruption and stealing including the
organs the international organs that were channelling the food to us, which was
prominently UNRRA, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency. I remember
when I broke my front tooth so that I was toothless in the front for about two or three
years on crackers sent to us supposedly by American donors to the dps that were so hard
they were almost impossible to bite. That's how I cracked one tooth. It was always a
struggle for food. Eventually UNRRA was turned 14:19: into IRO, International
Refugee Organization, but all the scuttlebutt and all the appearances we heard and saw
was that there was an enormous corruption, an enormous black market of food supplies
collected from many countries of the world, including I'm sure a great many well
meaning people in the United States with a great deal of it being stolen or ending up on
the black market and some of the officials getting very rich in the process. About a year
after I entered the gymnasium in Munich the entire high school with our teachers was
sent to a punishment camp by the American authorities. By 1946, the Soviets were
exerting great political pressure to repatriate all displaced persons. Many of us Polish
Nationals hearing that things were very unsettled in Poland didn't want to go yet,
including the Polish forces who fought with the Allies at Tobruk, Monte Cassino and
those who helped liberated Holland and Belgium and the Polish air force fighting for the
battle of Britain. Eschewal repatriation because of word that the Soviets were entrenched
with the Apparatchiks and so on, so that many of us didn't want to go back there until
there was an assurance of free elections in Poland which as we know had not
materialized. The pressure on the refugee organizations and the American zone
authorities was so strong by the Soviets that there was a constant propaganda to return to

one's home country, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Russia, what have you. The high
school with our teachers was considered the hot bed of patriotism and nationalism simply
because we were the more educated by comparison with the average uneducated inmate
of the displaced person's camp, and because the schoolin _—-??_—_ as a unit refused
to be repatriated together with our professors who were prewar Polish teachers who
found themselves in one way or another in Germany after the war, we were sent to a
punishment camp in a place called Altenstadt near Garmisch Partenkirchen, wooden
barracks. As it turned out, very cold and hardly heated in winter in order to break our
spirit so that we would go to Poland, help solve the refugee problem for the American
authorities and diplomatically help the Western allies who had millions of refugees on
their hands in Germany further pressured by the Germans themselves who were telling
them how can we rebuild our country with millions of refugees who don't want to go
home. What's going to become of them. America and Australia and Canada and New
Zealand, playing the waiting game, hoping that we all would go back home that they
wouldn't have to admit us as emigrants. This waiting game went on in my case for five
years. But in Altenstadt when we were herded on a train, we Refugees, displaced
persons, members of the nations which fought on the Allied side in Germany, we were
now being sent to a punishment camp because we refused repatriation under the
communist regime. On the way to Altenstadt, we were stopped and searched by the
American constabulary who was evoking in us an echo of being transported by the Nazis.
Here we are a bunch of helpless civilians, Polish Nationals including mostly students of
high school age with their professors guarded by the American constabulary which was a
form of military police. Some of the MP units on occupation Germany called themselves

constabulary. At one point, a train was stopped. It was warm summer, every one of us
refugees of Nazis was searched by the American constabulary and anything that was
found in our possession fork, knife, old spoon for which we had no receipts of purchase
was thrown on a heap and taken away from us. These were the measures employed by a
combination of refugee authorities, the American constabulary and as we found out
nearby a detachment of CIC where the head of it was a communist, an American officer.
He also tried to force what he thought Polish nationalist to go back to Poland, because he
may have been under orders to solve the refugee problem. Now, if you think of the
ignominy of asking refugees to produce a receipt that we had purchased it during and
after the war where one simply grabbed a fork 14:26: and a knife whenever one could,
but here the American constabulary penalizing us refugees, us Allies to produce what
would be under normal conditions in America. If you have something, produce a receipt
of purchase. It was an unforgettable experience to me and the shady side of the
American occupation that one had liberated me and on the other hand showed me the
ugly side of America. Still in all, my faith in the United States never faltered because I
felt that these were only people and the country as such is built upon Jeffersonian
principles and liberty and justice for all and so on. And then as I prepared to enter the
University of Munich as a pauper student after graduation, the food was scandalous, the
little rations by that time. I had joined the Polish student home in Munich and our entire
support was a carton of cigarettes sent by the Polish exile government in London to us,
one carton a month. That was the entire support. So, those of us who smoke had the
excruciating choice, to smoke half and sell the other half on the black market where you
buy some food. By that time I applied and joined the Polish forces which were assisting

the American army and occupation. Polish forces put together from ex POWs and
refugees and all kinds of young men who had been members of the Polish Armed forces
before the war. There were all together I believe 60,000 of them in the American and
British Zones of Occupation. All wore the American or British uniforms with Poland on
the shoulder until the cold war started in '48 and the Soviets were launching propaganda
that the Americans and the British are cultivating Polish forces to liberate Poland. End of

Tape 2

A: So, when I started attending the university of Munich on food rations that one can only
imagine, no money no tuition to be sure, I have friends in New York to this day there are
three of them that are my buddies, Polish students and to this day share a great friendship.
We would share a slice of bread and a potato. This is '47 and '48, two years after the war.
We were almost completely destitute, no source of income, no way to earn the money
and no place to go except starting to attend lectures because every one of us wanted to
make some thing of ourselves. I then decided that in order to survive and get some
decent food I would join the Polish forces. Officially they became to be known as Polish
guard, but we where in the service of the American army not armed because the soviets
launched a huge propaganda that we were out to liberate Poland that the Americans and
the British were cultivating this force in order to march on Poland but we were guarding
American depots and performing a semi police duty for the American army. By that
time, it was very difficult to get in on that force because there were three square meals a
day and lodging and so on. Still, I resolved that I would try and what happened was a
quirk of fate. When I appeared before the company commander who as it turned out was
the prewar Polish army professional warrant officer called , in Polish.
But I had been sufficiently exposed to anti-semitic moments that I resolved at the first
opportunity I would have I would revert back to my assumed name, Polish name
Kutrzeba, but how to do it. The best way to do it when I was about to join that Polish
force even though I continued to study at the university whenever I could, attended
lectures, and that 15:04: was the time to obtain a new identity under my old name. I

appeared before the company commander and had a long interview. I showed him my
graduation papers from the Polish gymnasium, but I told him my real name was Kutrzeba
and this is how I wanted to be known from now on. He asked me why and I had to
concoct a new story in order to as by that time I pledged to myself remain Polish and
catholic and make an absolutely clean break with Jews, and eventually hoping to
immigrate to America into yet another lions den and I say it advisedly just as went into
East Prussia with fake Polish documents hoping that in Germany I would be less apt to be
found out a Jew than by fellow Polish nationals. This time I felt I would go to America
as a Polish catholic and as long as I keep away from certain people, nobody would care,
nobody would even bother because I had been told that in American as long as you do
your job well, nobody cares who you are. Well, we'll get to that. So, when I appeared
15:06: before the captain and told him that Fajwiszys was a name that I took on because
I didn't want to go back to Poland in the event that I was forced to go under my original
name Kutrzeba. The name Kutrzeba has produced two famous persons in Poland. One
was a revered history professor at the Jagelonian University in Krakow well known to all
the academics and the other was General Kutrzeba after which my father named me. He
asked me whether I was related, the captain that is, to General Kutrzeba, and I said no not
really. Within one week I was accepted to enroll and I started within weeks as a corporal,
later went to a sergeant and eventually became a second lieutenant with my main duties
being teaching English to Polish troops as most of them were hoping to emigrate to an
English speaking country, America, Canada, Australia, what have you. But I also
performed the duties of the officer of the day every sixth day or so. It was months later
that I found out from one of the members of that company that Captain Voiski told him

that he knew General Kutrzeba, that I looked like him. He was convinced that I was his
son except that I was denying it preferring not to ask for extra favors and that was the
reason that he hired me even though it was extremely difficult to be hired since the
American Army put a quota on how many could be hired. So, then I spent two years as
an officer for the Polish guard force working directly for the American Army and in the
end we received preferential treatment for immigration to the U.S. as we served the
American army.

Q: Can I ask a question. In all this time, did you feel alone, without family? Did you think
about that?

A: Being alone and lonely became a fixture, sort of like a lamp 15:09: or the sky ora
hurricane. At times an excruciating experience, a tortuous experience, worse yet because
you have no one to confide in, no one to consult. I have made errors that in retrospect
that if I had a kindly older person to consult or advise me let alone having the kinship and
the warmth of the family. Now, I was alone. I was friendly with a few of the soldiers
there. I became friendly with two or three of my fellow Polish students, but strangely
enough, at the Polish student home in Munich, no one spoke of his war time experiences,
and we were so touchy and respectful of one another that no one asked the other -- well,
we might ask where you're from originally -- no one asked how did you survive, and I'm
talking about non-Jews. Some Poles were taken into labor camps. Some participated in
the Warsaw uprising, taken prisoner. It was almost an unspoken concordat where no one
spoke of his war time experiences. You don't have to be Jewish to suppress the tortuous

and tragic events in your life if they are so close to you as we learned as we got older, 30,
40, 50 years later. It took that many years for some people to start confronting the torture
of the war time experiences. At that time, '48, '49, '50, in Munich, the emphasis and the
focus was on surviving. What's tomorrow. What am I going to do tomorrow and as we
and some of my fellow students whose age range from -- I was the youngest. The rest of
them were prewar students whose studies were either interrupted by war in the POW
camps or what have you and some were 26 and 30 years old. So, I was the youngest, and
our main focus after all being young and not being able to help ourselves and some
whose families they had not heard from or who were also executed. Poland also had
three million citizens executed in addition to three million Polish Jews. Our main focus
was on what are we going to eat tomorrow and smoke and where are we going to find
young girls to sleep with in addition to studying. That was the main focus. I in addition
who had no family left, no one of my original background left, and I then began to play
my role to the fullest of Polish catholic.

Q: Did you enjoy yourself at all. Did you start a social life?

A: Oh, sure, many times "you enjoyed yourself," especially when I started receiving income
from serving in the Polish guard and still maintaining a tiny room in the student home.
Of course I went to lectures. Of course I milled around with the Germans, but never got
close to a single German. I remember one or two students took a liking to me and wanted
to find out more about me, and wanted to invite me home to dinner and I turned it down.
I didn't want to have anything to do with the Germans, although there was no other place

to study except at a German university. We were given preferential treatment, I mean
displaced persons. The average young German had to perform physical labor for a year
or two or three to clear rubbles and ruins of the bombed city until his turn came to attend
a university, because millions of Germans who had not been killed in the war came back
and they all wanted to study. We displaced 15:14: persons, as long as our credentials
academically were sound, were accepted instantly, but the rest of the time there was no
money, but if you could get a date with a German girl, sure why not. There was nothing
else. You were a young man and blood was boiling so of course you would go to the
park and go by the river and enjoy yourself in the sense where travel was almost
impossible, passes were hardly obtainable, money was not there and I was lucky because
I was getting three square meals a day and whatever I could I shared with my buddies
who tried to scrounge of food someplace else.

Q: But you never got too close to people?

A: No. I could not get close to anybody because then the questions would follow about
family about school and I had enough of my role intact to answer the basic questions,
such as my family was killed. I went to school such and such before the war, gammer
school, who cared and the rest of it was being suppressed.

Q: Did you feel like an imposter or that this was just the new you?

A: It shifted. There was a degree of self loathing at times. There was a feeling that I was
dishonest toward my newly acquired friends other students, because one day they find out
who I really am they would say to me, you were lying to us all along. Anybody else who
would come even remotely close to my original background, I immediately stayed away
from. This is how I came to America because in the Polish guard forces there were only
six, seven officers, a company of about 120, and two of them as I learned gradually were
anti-semites and both of them were suspecting me of being Jewish with little
innuenendos. Whenever an innuendo like that was directed towards me, I felt as if my
whole world collapsed within. I would be n utter depression for days, but not knowing
what to do with myself and having to put a face out to the world so I would not betray
myself. My mind was made up. Sooner or later there is going to be another Holocaust.
There is going to be another genocide because it was unthinkable that the world would
not try it all over the again, since Jews are reputed to be the killer of Christ, at least that is
what I knew up to that time. My mind was made up that I wasn't going to go through this
again, that if I had a new identity and a reasonable speech and deportment that I'm going
to preserve that. So, even though I could have stayed on in Germany for another year or
two or three, because at that time I was both a student and earning some decent money
where I could take girls out on dates and go to the opera and so on and had an imposing
uniform and being an 15:18: officer, the Germans respected more than anything else,
Herr Leutnant, they would flatten themselves because if it's a military rank the Germans
would respect that, no matter who that is. If you don't have it, they'll step on you as fast
on as a cockroach, but their respect for military uniform and authorities. So, I had a fairly
decent life in addition to attending university and teaching English and performing officer

of the day every sixth day 24 hours, but I knew that that would not last. That could not
last, and that I wanted to go away as far as possible with my newly confirmed identity
Polish catholic. So, when everybody else, at least a great many applied for immigration
so did I. One day my number came up. I had no affidavit. I had no relatives that I knew
of or wanted to contact. Eventually I learned that my father's brother lived in America
for 40 some years, and eventually I got to him. But I put my name on the list and it
turned out that this was a contingent provided with blank affidavits by the Connecticut
Tobacco Growers. Connecticut had been growing cigar tobacco for years and years,
shaded fields, very hard labor. Well, a Mr. McCormick from near Bradleyfield
Connecticut who wanted to get cheap labor, nothing wrong with that, American
capitalist, you know, make money where 15:20: you can, had some Jamaican blacks but
he wanted to have some nicer white boys from Europe. And through the NCWC,
National Catholic Welfare Conference, Conference of American Bishops who were
acting as the Jewish organizations were and others, to provide blank affidavits for young
Polish refugees who had no place to turn. So, I came under that quota with $10 in my
pocket flown by the Flying Tiger Company in 1950 from Munich via Keflavik and
Gander, New Foundland, because jets could not make the transatlantic trip yet, was taken
to LaGuardia, and driven right to a tobacco farm where we started the next morning at
6:00. I and some twenty other Polish young men with no place to go were grateful that
we were able to obtain American visa and the time was April 1950. We came on the
tobacco farm and were shown our lodgings which were the former CCC barracks,
Civilian Conservation Corp under Roosevelt, clapped together with wooden boards, a
barrack of maybe 30, 40 persons double bunks half of them black Jamaican negroes and

half of us young Polish people. Work was back breaking under the shades, there were
nets hung to protect the cigar tobacco in case of rain so that the leaves would not be
destroyed by rain or hail. So, I was working 90 degrees in that heat under the nets which
were back breaking and humid beyond description. 75 cents an hour, half of the weekly
income was deducted for our food and room meaning barracks and the food was made by
Jamaican cooks. To go to the nearest city, Hartford over the weekend we would probably
spend the entire weekly wage whatever was left of it after taxes and deductions for food.
This was my beginning in the United States. War in Korea broke out six weeks after I
came to this country, and when I weighed in my mind what to do next, am I going to
finish university studies which were almost out of the land of fantasy, and income and
job, I had gone to the post office in Hartford Connecticut to volunteer for the airforce. I
was by that time 22. I was in reasonably good condition, and I wanted to become a pilot
and when I think now what motivated me to volunteer for the U.S. air force, I think there
are at least three elements and in what proportion I'm not able to say. One was that in my
own view of romantic idealism still in all despite some individual incidents in Germany
after the liberation, I was alive because so many Americans died to conquer Hitler's
machine. I was liberated by the American army. I was given entry into the United
States. Now, as I saw it in my fairly naive romantic mind this country is in trouble. It's
being attacked by an enemy, that's the North Koreans, so I would volunteer. Secondly, I
would feel proud to wear a legitimate American uniform. Now, I'm fully legitimate
finally. Thirdly, I felt that I would not have to work on a --by that time I know longer
worked on a tobacco farm because I got a job in a factory in East Hartford I believe.
Very, very difficult job where I threw up many times because there was no air

conditioning, hot in the summer, working on a machine having to do a quota, also 75
cents an hour and my stomach started acting up and I started throwing up because I was
not used to the combination of milk shakes on one hand which I couldn't digest properly
and the humidity on the other hand. So, by that time I already worked in a factory and I
realized that if I volunteer for the army I'll have rom and board after all and maybe, just
maybe I'll be able to continue my studies because I knew by that time what the G.I. bill
had been. What I didn't know was that it would take a long time before Congress would
award the Korean veterans that same as World War II veterans because of political
reasons the war in Korea was called police action and not war. But, in any event I then
got caught in an incredible bureaucratic catch 22. The Air Force told me that I couldn't
be accepted as a volunteer until I had my first papers. First papers meant the declaration
of intention to become a U.S. citizen. It would take months before it would be processed
bureaucratically and until then they couldn't accept me into the armed forces. So, I was
willing to wait and one day when I came back -- I was renting a room for I think $6 a
week in West Hartford in Beacon Street, two elderly ladies who housed me. One day I
came in and my land lady said you 15:27:30have "greetings" and I said from whom?
And she said from the United States, and I found out that that meant a draft notice. It was
called greetings. I said they can't draft me because I already volunteered to the air force
and I ran to the captain and he then told me that was the catch 22. As a resident of the
United States, one could be drafted at any time even a foreign student residing in this
country could be drafted under the draft law, but to volunteer you have to have the
declaration of intention to become a U.S. citizen which takes months. In any event, the
army got me and I ended up in I think one of the most abominable divisions I think as far

as treatment is concerned the 44th division part of Oklahoma National Guard where the
cadre was what we called Oakies. There were policemen and all kinds of other men who
felt that there would never be another war after World War II therefore they would get
the income drink beer over the weekend and get some money for being in the National
Guard. All of a sudden war in Korea broke out, they were federalized and there was
something like 3,000 of them cadre and they had to find 10,000 cannon fodder meaning
northern boys to become privates and all of them were upgraded and this as I found out
they were taking out on us northerers still the vengefulness of the civil war. You know,
the oakies finally have a chance to get Yankees and to tell them what to do. I went
through some pretty hard times there. Once I was sent on shit detail for two weeks
because I defended blacks in the division. When I was drafted into the U.S. Army in
November of 1950, after very intensive basic training we had gone to Japan to train on
the island of Hokaido. The Stars and Stripes wrote that in the entire history of the United
States Army there hadn't been as intensive an infantry training as our division because in
the wake of the initial American defeats when the war in Korea broke out, when it turned
out that the average American soldier was unprepared and unfit physically to negotiate all
the hills up and down, and up and down the terrain with backpacks, the Army was
resolved on giving two divisions the 45th infantry Oklahoma National Guard and the
40th called the Sunburst of California to give them the most intensive training. And it
was one step from hell, the training. I then resolved that if I'm going to fight the war for
this country I might as well fight it and not get all the chicken feed from the tobacco
chewing oakies as we called them and I volunteered for the front line service in Korea.
Call it suicide instinct, whatever you wish, but I call it differently but that's for another

time. Eventually in Korea one year in the battle zone, there was some tough times. In
fact there was a time with Oklahoma division on training where I seriously considered
suicide because I just could not take the vicious handling by the southern non-coms who
treated us northern gun fodder with utter contempt. This is also when I found out one
more facet of true America when in Oklahoma National Guard sergeant once came into
our barracks and started -- drunken, started a whole tirade against blacks and there were
some blacks that served in our divisions but troops were then still separated, and I opened
my big mouth and I said well sergeant I'm serving this wonderful country because I
believe in it's principle of equality and justice and so on. Well, my punishment was two
weeks on the shed detail, you know, digging ditches and so on. So, I began to
accumulate my treasury of the many facets of America by that time. And when I served
my time and came to this country and applied for Yale, I had to wait about nine months
or so before the next school year, but I was accepted and eventually I had gone to the
Yale Drama School on three scholarships, the G.I. bill, small scholarship from the Polish
National Home in Hartford, and after the first semester, a half tuition scholarship from
Yale itself. Plus, waiting on tables at the law school, the likes of Bill Lincoln and George
Bush [?] had gone there probably just before me or certainly after me. Two hours a day
to earn my three meals. Washing windows during Easter vacation when my rich friends
went off snowboarding or skiing or whatever, and driving a Good Humor ice cream truck
in the summer to earn my keep for the next academic year. Eventually I married a local
New Haven woman, with whom I have a grown daughter, Karen. I lived with her for
three years, and she still didn't know my background. She thought I was Polish catholic,
because everything else I was suppressing. Nobody at Yale knew who I really was.

Once I almost had a nervous breakdown because it seems that when I got close to
someone I couldn't take even a small rejection. I thought I fell in love with a fellow
student, but I think it was like a puppy love, and things functioned all right as long as I
was like someone compared to driving a bike, as long as you're moving and you work
and you strive, you're okay. The minute the bike stops, you fall off. So, that when some
feelings started developing toward the young woman I felt that if she didn't respond as
much as I would want to emotionally, my whole world collapsed because I could not take
what I thought was emotional rejection. No family, no friends, no one close, so that
became very difficult to handle and it became a recurring pattern later on as well. In any
event, when I got to New York after graduation something like A minus I guess, you call
it with honors, I tried to get a job with CBS because the stage jobs that were available to
me were not enough to support a wife and a young child. Among others I had gone to
CBS because at that time CBS was developing a lot of good drama, which is now almost
gone practically gone. Studio One, etc. The following incident I think is rather poignant.
There was one man in the CBS television by the name of Jim Levinthal who interviewed
me. As I was hoping to get an entry while being a page at NBC working the Steve Allen,
the Tonight Show and so on, I think $44 a week as a uniform paid for by NBC. I had
gone tosee Jim Levinthal at CBS two more times and at one point he said to me--
and he was in charge of hiring production assistants to become stage managers and
directors, like John Frankheimer for example who had gone through that route. He asked
me where did you say you came from and I said I came from Germany. He burst out and
he said to me, "I'll be goddamn if I'm going to hire for the CBS program department,
someone who came from Germany." And that was that. Jim Levinthal obviously an

American Jew and I was a Polish Jew and he turned me down because I had come from
Germany. In this sense I suppose he reaffirmed his glorious American Jewish identity
where he wouldn't hire someone who had come from Germany. So much for that scene,
and that route was cut off. Eventually I got in through another door. While I was at CBS
the first few years of course everybody knew me as a Polish catholic and that as that. My
marriage was breaking up, and in '59 I was divorced and I was still with CBS. About the
time before the marriage was broke up after three years, I was driving from Hartford
Connecticut to Mt. Vernon New York, where I lived with my then family, and a
passenger was a middle aged woman from Israel. She impressed me as having being
made of an entirely different cloth. Tough and hard nosed and courageous and speaking
of the new Israeli pioneer spirit although she introduced herself Polish Jewish. At one
point she sat in the back, my wife next to me she fired a point blank question. Are you
Jewish? I said yes. Then I surprised myself. It was something in her demeanor, in her
deportment that apparently got through to me. She then spent the night with us and one
word led to another and it opened up a whole past life for my then wife who knew
nothing about it. It was that woman from Israel who began to insist whether I had any
relatives in the world, and I said that I understood that my father's brother who had come
to this country in the 20s that he was here somewhere. She wanted to know why I
wouldn't look him up and I said of course not. First of all, he wouldn't understand me.
He would condemn me. Secondly, I have nothing to do with him. I never met him, and I
have some questions to him if I met him which I don't want to, what was he doing when
we were being 'geharget" as they say in Yiddish, or exterminated and I don't want to go
through the whole war time history with him because he would want it. She had

undertaken upon herself to try to trace my uncle, my father's younger brother, and when
she had made contact, she prevailed on me to meet him using every kind of appeal for me
to consent. When I finally did, we made a date because my uncle lived in Brooklyn and
we lived in Mt. Vernon. We made a date to meet at Rockefeller Center, 30 Rock Plaza,
as you walk in through the main door, I remember, in the main lobby, he described how
he would look and Mrs. Bergman, the woman from Israel accompanied me. At once we
saw a little man, slim with an elderly woman apparently his wife. She approached him
and confirmed his identity. He walked up to me -- that is my uncle, my closest living
relative, 1959, which is 14 years after the war. He pulled me to the side, walked over
toward the very corner of the marble wall there, and said to me are you Joe, Yossl? I said
yes. He looked to me turned towards the wall and started crying like a little baby. He
couldn't say another word. It was I who had to gently pat him on the back and say Uncle
Sam, all right, calm down now. I had to calm him down. Well, eventually I started
visiting him and my marriage broke up, but shortly before it did, my wife started to
persuade me to try to find out who I really am because I was between and betwixt. All of
a sudden when that Pandora's box had been tapped I had no idea of who I was anymore,
how I should act, what I should aim for and what my identity was etc. So, that my uncle
-- through a ruse I found later, but through a ruse, made an appointment with me and a
16:14: Rabbi in New Rochelle, who then was the presiding Rabbi of New York City. It's
a rotating function. Rabbi David Golemvenski, now deceased. Through a ruse because if
my uncle would have asked me to see a Rabbi I would have turned him down. I would
say I have nothing to do with a Rabbi. I didn't even know one before the war in a Jewish
family which was traditional but not very religious. But he used a rouse together with a

rabbi I was told that the Jewish Center needed a director to direct a play. That was the
rouse. I said sure, okay. When I went there little by little, he was a rabbi in the U.S.
Marine Corp and advisor in Jewish Affairs among others to President Roosevelt. A man
very accomplished and very bright. Well, one word led to another and he started a series
of conversations with me and once | opened up I started letting him have it. I said where
were all the rabbis when we were being surrounded. Where were the rabbis when we had
to reaffirm our national identity in the spirit of resistance they instead urged us not to
offer any resistance because a good Jew doesn't she blood and so on. Where were all the
rabbis that for two thousand years taught us passivity instead of reaffirmation of human
dignity through resistance and so on. By the time that I started these conversations after I
had met the rabbi once only I decided to seek out Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, who was a
national figure, like Reverend Robertson today or Billy Graham. Fulton Sheen as a
bishop had a half hour show on t.v. nationwide and was an incredible speaker. So, I
thought I would repair to him and seek his advice. I was in his home on Muray Hill a
number of times, and we had many conversations and it was then that my uncle Sam said
to me well, you're a rational man. You went to Yale. Certainly why shouldn't you listen
to the other side. I said sure it makes sense. And I started seeing Rabbi Golovensky. In
the final analysis it didn't solve many of my problems of identity and the really point of
explosion occurred when my uncle in about 1960 or so finally one day laid it on the table
and said to honor my parents and to honor Jewish people in my heritage and so on, he
says I had been baptized under duress as he called it and I called it not. I said it was of
my own volition. He said well, what did you know you were 15 years old. You were
frightened, you were terrified to death and the man was kind to you and told you there is

another god who is more valid and so on and in the name of that god Jews had been
murdered for centuries and in the name of Christ allegedly as Christ killers, the biggest
lie in history. So, my uncle made me an ultimatum, in fact wrote me a letter which I
believe I have to this day saying that I ought to publicly renounce catholicism and
reconvert to be a Jew, possibly some kind of a mumbo jumbo ceremony. I said
absolutely not. Whatever happened, happened, and it happened because a magnificent
young man, a priest, in the name of his god, but his god must be our god if we believe in
unideism, or else nothing makes sense. In the name of the higher postulates of religion
and human morality he risked his life because he 16:19: believes that love thy neighbor
is the basic tenet. A man who did that for me in the name of his religion or call it is
liturgy cannot be wrong, must be a worthy person and I am not going to spit him in the
face and walk out on everything he taught me only because you who did nothing to save
me want me to. We had a few very explosive conversations and it sent me into a long
bout of depression. I believe at that point CBS has layoffs so the people with least
seniority had to be laid off. As it turned out several months later they rehired me, but I
already had a job with the U.N. then, and I was in the most abysmal state of depression.
Again deserted, again alienated from everybody, again feeling myself deserted by my
next of kin who said that if I don't reconvert he will condemn me and doesn't want to
have anything to do with me. In one of the conversations I remember was rather
explosive in his home and I asked him point blank, telling him that a decent Pole, a
Christian with the help of a few other priests saved my life, risking it every minute of the
day and I asked him at one point, what did you do Uncle Sam to save your own family at
the time when strangers were saving Jews lives? What did you do? And he started

giving me what I call etcha petcha metcha, which means well you know there was some
anti-semitism and there were the German Bund here and it wasn't so easy, and I said did
you chain yourself to the gate of the White House as a protest because your brother and
you family was being exterminated. If you didn't you have no right to tell me how to live
my life, and what friend to honor, and whom to be loyal to. So, the following period, if I
remember, about two years where I had nothing to do with him or his wife. And I was
told in retrospect that he couldn't sleep nights. That he was crying and so on, but what I
felt all along would happen that sooner or later if not my uncle then someone else would
condemn me a traitor to the Jewish race because I was baptized. Along in about 1962, by
pure chance I had walked into Yivo, the Jewish Historical Institute because Rabbi
Golvensky felt and insisted that I ought to go. There may be a photograph or maybe
something of my family of my past because I had nothing to reestablish the link with my
past and to his credit he insisted and pressed me. So, I did, and when I walked into Yivo,
and said who I was, my original name, there still was on the staff the few survivors who
of course knew music and culture in Poland, and a man by the name of Finklestein
immediately popped and said of course I knew your father. I said to myself, yes, a lot of
people say they know my father like a lot of people know the pope, or Lenny Bernstein
but does he know everyone. I was used to that by the way. When I was a child
everybody said I know your father and it turned out my father didn't even know the man.
So, within minutes he called from upstairs, as it turned out a revered, gentleman by the
name of Jonas Turkow, a famous Polish actor and director before World War II, who as it
turned out was a friend a my father was with my father in the committee for underground
in the Warsaw Ghetto. His wife was the famous Diana Blumenthal, a chanteuse for

whom my father wrote songs at one time, and he came down when I was introduced.
Finklestein said this is Joseph Fajwiszys, he said you are little Joe? I said, yes I guess so.
Well, that's when the next chapter in my long track to reestablish my roots so to speak
had begun. Because Ilu Turkow then had me in this home and with his wife Diana
Blumenthal showed me a handwritten song my father wrote once for his wife which he
buried in a can in the Warsaw Ghetto ruins before he managed to scale the wall posing as
a Polish railroad man and found it after the war. He gave me and I still have it, anda
long, long conversation started with a man whose daughter, herself, had been given over
to Christians and when he survived the war his daughter who by then was eight or nine
was saying oh those goddamn Jews, was inbued with anti-semitism by the very people to
whom Turkoff entrusted his own daughter. So, his daughter also had a very difficult road
back but at least had the original father and mother and so on, and still I understand as of
a few years ago, she's not in very good shape mentally. Well, Turkoff as if he had found
his own son. This went on for a number of months. I came to respect him and regard
him highly because he had no religious ax to grind. He was just a man of culture. A man
of tradition but progressive and so on. And one day, he told me that a man had visited
him who was in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and that he would like to start an
organization that had something to do with those who were in the resistance movement in
the Warsaw Ghetto and wanted me to be part of it. I had grave scruples. I didn't want to
do anything about it, but more and more he appealed to my conscience and the rest is
history, because the few of us that's Jack Eisner, Jonas Stutkoff, Bob Bjorn and Joe
Tulesky, Latka Meed and myself, formed an organization that we didn't know for weeks
how to call it. Finally I came up with the acronym WAGRO, Warsaw Ghetto Resistance

Organization and I threw myself into that work, even though I was with CBS at the same
time. We wanted to among other things, the objectives we discussed but then I wrote
them the final version and they're still everyday at Madison Square Garden it's all there,
it's all my language among other things is to build a memorial to Warsaw Ghetto heroes
in New York. And we started raising funds for it with $1 little coupon contributions. I
sold them to anybody, from Walter Cronkite, to Mike Wallace, you name it, hundreds.
Then it turned out from the treasurer I couldn't get an accounting of how much money we
took in.

Q: How did this impact you psychologically when you had to all of sudden start dealing with
a past that you had put very much in the back of your mind?

16:27

A: Well, both consciously and unconsciously I think that I felt that I finally no matter what
the religious scruples were and no matter which church or synagogue I chose to pray in
that it's my own damn business but at least I am who I am and I am the son of my father
and I am the product of a certain tradition. The conflicts came with what I call the low
class people, the Yiddishists, not that every Yiddishist is low class. Don't misunderstand
me. There are some marvelous writers and poets, but Yiddishist in this context I call low
class people who even before the war didn't know the language of the country but only
spoke Yiddish and now wanted to remake history in the image of their particular social
class. And people who wore their congressional medal honor which I called their
concentration camp star, as a congressional medal of honor. In other words, any Jew who
had not been to a concentration camp can only be relegated to secondary or tertiary role

because they were the front line troops. If you were not in a concentration camp, you
don't count. Your voice is not important. You were too assimilated. If you know Polish
literature if you want to speak your mother tongue, which was Polish in my case, and the
case of Anielewicz, that's secondary. Yiddish is our language, concentration camp is our
passport and that's that. They would not admit any dissenting voices. My clean break
with them came after a year and a half where I was the only American educated member
with everyone asking me to do things from the composition to board of directors and
getting a non profit status and tax exempt status and doing the first two commemorations
including one at Carnegie Hall organizing the whole thing artistically and managerially
and all I asked for is that we run ourselves according to the American principles of
legality and democracy. So, when it came to elections, and I had no ambition to be a
president but only to elect someone else, there were two slates and they quashed down
the second slate with big arms and strong pushy elbows and at that time, I left. So once
more I left my people.

Tape 3

A: Ever since I began to acknowledge my roots which goes back to '59 and '62, it's been now
over 30 years of intermittent, at time tortuous, inner life, except that I no longer am
hiding -- parts of me are still hiding, but by and large I'm not. A cynic might say it comes
with age because the closer we are to the end of our life we care less about when it might
start all over again and from history we know that the ways of persecution of Jews and
we see in the world today where other minorities are occasionally being exterminated by
others. You don't have to be Jewish to be a Biafran, Nigerian, Bosnian and Serbian, and
so on and so on, but you begin to care less and less about survival at any cost. Now it
matters, survival with integrity. As I was construing my integrity way back then, I felt
that and I've been throughout my childhood that any Jew who would convert is a traitor
to the nation, and I believed it because what else was I to believe except everything I was
taught. Eventually through the shock of the selections and the extermination phase when
I was desperate and destitute and a young priest put his life on the line for me, but also
taught me a great many things which I had not been taught in my childhood. I was taught
a few prayers, just mumbling them in order to satisfy one class in school and that was the
end of it. I had been to synagogue maybe two three times a year on the high holidays
because my father felt that he ought to put in an appearance and occasionally he
conducted a 12 voice choir or played the philharmonia which was sort of like an organ.
But it had been inbuted in me that throughout that a Jew who is baptized and is converted
is a traitor to his nation. He does it only for self advancement or for other commercial
reasons. That is why I felt that when I was baptized by the priest and I remember once he

told me that it would be interesting to know if I would hold faith with the truth as he
taught me in addition to love thy neighbor of which he was the best exemplified tenet, but
also about Christ and so on. He said at one point it would be interesting to know that
when the war was over if I would keep faith, because he says throughout centuries Jews
converted in order to survive when it was more convenient and when the threat was no
longer there they reconverted as he said a Jew will always be a Jew. I was determined to
prove to him as I construed my integrity that that was not so, that I would be faithful to
the faith as he taught me. That I would not change 180 degrees the minute it was
convenient to me and the minute that was over that I could get help from Jewish
organizations. In fact I had never gone to a Jewish organization. I came to America on
my own, worked on a tobacco farm but I would not go to a Jewish organization because
then I would have to go through the third degree and say oh but I baptized, I'm very sorry
now could you help me with money. I would not do that. So, throughout all this I felt
that I've lost everything, but my integrity as a human being, and as a human being I ought
to keep faith with the priest that saved my life. That was my contract, that's it's okay to
convert when you saw the true light or human kindness or mercy as exemplified by
another religion, but it's not okay to reconvert because then you have no values left.

Q: Is religion a contract or is simply a belief?

A: Being in contact with Father Furkosksy for the last 50 years, I was guilty of not
answering his letters sometimes for a year or longer, but he never got angry. He always
wrote again and again with love and compassion and understanding until we had our first

reunion and second and then later on in Israel when he was decorated and so on. But
there were long periods when I didn't see contact with 17:07:30 him because I felt I
would have to live up to what he expected me, and I found that I progressively could not.
I could not live a chaste life. As I told him once that without a love of a woman, I don't
want to live in this world. He said he could understand that, that I had to get to the
bottom of the few reasons for the persecution of Jews as he had implanted in me. That
resulted eventually in a film that I was prevailed upon to do, namely Children in the
Holocaust that nearly devastated me. I just couldn't sleep nights and so on and going to
ten countries and listening to stories of some of the survivors that I couldn't even imagine
that such plight existed in other cases. And throughout it all I had to find myself. Myself
meaning that at one point I read all the four epistles from beginning to end and I
immersed myself in books on the sources of anti-semitism and by omission and
commission and by hiding by running away by struggling over many years, I have finally
reached what I believe is going to stay with me and stick with me and that's me. That's
only in the last few recent years. What is me, first of all. I am who I am in terms of my
birth, my roots, my heritage. There's no getting away from that. I am proud of it as much
as an Irishman is proud to be Irish and a Pole is proud to be Polish. No more and no less.
I condemn and have so done in articles and speeches that I have made. People no matter
what their ethnic grouping is, Jews or non Jews who look for a scape goat. Anti-semites
look for Jews as scapegoats when the economy is down and they say it's all the faults of
the Jews. Jews when they feel empowered find a scapegoat in others. Whether they be
certain degrees of second citizenship among Palestinians, and I'm not a utopian and I
know the reality and self preservation, or for many years claiming that all Poles are

anti-semites, which is equally untrue. Because according to Yad va Shem 37 percent of
all righteous Christians honored were Poles. There are Jewish circles who condemn
Poles for anti- semitism simply because it is now more convenient because there are now
until at least recently they were more helpless than the Germans. The same Jews who go
to visit Germany or receive pension checks from Germany do not attack Germans en bloc
but they do attack Poles en bloc, meaning that there are some absolutely undeniable facts.
The undeniable facts are the holocaust, the Nazi extermination and their collaborators.
That is absolutely undeniable. It is also undeniable that among other nations there were
victims who were tortured because of the nationalism, because they saved others, a few
hundred Polish priests and nuns were executed because they sheltered the Jews. That
cannot be shoved under the rug either. We Jews do not have the license to righteousness
only or to suffering. We must continuously also honor those who were tortured by
dictatorship and Nazism and continuously uphold as role models those who risked their
lives to save many of us. So, who am I? I'ma Jew and a Pole. I'm also an American
citizen and I hope a very loyal one. But anybody who would want to press further be
they a scientist or a common Yente would want the question between diverse would
always be no, so who are you? So, do you go to church or do you believe in Jesus
Christ? My first answer is non of your goddamn business. What I do in private is my
own self -- my own business as long as I don't deny who I am and whether I am more
comfortable to walk into church or synagogue, that's my own business. Now, for
posterity and for the sake of bearing witness and making a record, do I believe in Jesus
Christ because it all comes down to that right, sooner or later, right. Either you do or you
don't. Either you go right or you go left, said Mengele, right? First of all, I don't agree

with that kind of a Nazi theory that I owe it to anybody, to anybody in the world, to
publicly identify myself with this or with that. Having said that, my personal belief to
this day is do I believe in God? Sometimes yes, sometimes not. I believe that if he's
omnipotent, he must have been on vacation for a very long time. I think I'm familiar with
almost every dogmatic or church, dogmatic possible answer to the 17:15: question.
Well, God had simply set these things in mechanism but he gave us free will and so on. I
am familiar with every one of these postulates because I've been taught and I discussed it
with my priest and with others. Recently with a father professor of the catholic university
in Lublin who was here. We had hours of conversation. So, do I believe in God?
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't. Do I believe in Jesus Christ? From every
historical bit if evidence, there was such a man who lived and such man must have been a
role model along with several others throughout the ages for humanity to pursue possibly
never to attain, because who's willing to just abscond everything and just put on a sack
and eschew all the riches of the world etc, etc. Since such men lived, and expounded all
the goodness and all the mercy, this to me along with some other somewhat antiquated
wise sayings from the bible and the koran and whatever constitutes the essence of human
ethics and morality but advanced one or two steps more. Meaning, that goodness and
love they neighbor is no longer the province of Jews toward fellow Jews but anyone is
my neighbor, anyone is. If that had not been taken seriously by my savior, my priest, and
thousands of others like him, I wouldn't be here to talk to you, and the last vestiges of
morality and ethics expounded by the three major religions would be gone, even though
they collapsed long ago in Europe which has fought catholic and protestant one another.
So, that if Jesus Christ expounded these ideals in the name of which people are willing

risk their lives to serve their neighbor, a stranger, these are some of the highest ideals in
the world. Now, to go to one step further to the ultimate level, do you believe he was a
god? Well, there are theologians to this day who are not sure, protestant and catholic. I
read all 17:18: four epistles cover to cover to this day, and I don't see anywhere Christ
saying I am God. He said I am the son of God, but in the next chapter, another evangelist
or he himself says, we are all children of God, so to claim the deity of God, the
immaculate conception of Virgin Mary which some protestant reject also can go on and
go on. In the final analysis who do I pray to? None of your goddamn business. I pray
when I pray to God whenever I have hopes that he exists and not that he owes me a lot,
but I think he owes all of us a lot in order to justify the innocent slaughter of children,
millions of them in the world, to this day. But if there is some kind of a mechanism that I
don't understand, then I'm willing to say well I don't understand that and in times when I
must clutch onto something, and if I believe that there is a god, yes, sometimes I pray to
him. What I say to him is between him and me. I own no accounting to anyone else,
possibly to the man who saved my life, but then he and I we have our own way of
communicating. We understand each other.

Q: Is it possible for with your experiences to live with no acknowledgement of religion?

A: Well, the same question can be posed to millions of other Americans who --

Q: Yes, but I'm talking about you. Is religion important to you today?

A: Well, if I reached the end of my struggle maybe I'll be able to phrase it better for you.
I'm still struggling day by day. I very seldom go to church or synagogue. When I do,
sometimes I'm very comfortable in church and at times when I get the goose pimples
thinking that in the name of this or that my ancestors were being murdered by the
thousands. When I go to a synagogue I don't really feel very much because it's been
dulled by what I think has been the exclusiveness of the Jewish religion as we know it
today. That I no longer feel having been with many non Jews in situation of extreme
danger and in combat and in living in suffering with non-Jews as well and seeing that
they have the same humanity as Ido. They also suffer and cry and shake when there is
fear, and often would do anything for me as I have few friends like this, like these
non-Jews, I refuse to acknowledge that I am somehow the chosen smarter, more talented,
better and more adept than my fellow citizens, or good friends, non-Jews. I refuse to. I
excel in one way and they excel in something else. I cannot be part of an official religion
that claims we are the chosen people and continue to be chosen because that is an
invitation to exclusivity and to snobbish. You might say survival also, but it's not our
fault that the world had stolen the reformed Judaism from us because I call Jesus Christ
the reformed Judaism. From every available fact, he simply tried to reform the ongoing
corruption that sooner or later seeps into everything, into government into any organized
religion. He tried to reform that and anytime you try to reform an establishment you're
going to be condemned. This goes on in the U.S. air force or Jewish religion everywhere
else. I simply cannot be part of a segment, 17:24: religious or otherwise that claims
exclusivity and somehow a level above everyone else that may have existed at one time,
but I don't think it should any longer and I am all for people organizing and having

cultural groups and so on. If you want to go to synagogue that's fine, but if you ask me, I
have been back and forth to hell and back so many times that I only --it's nice when I can
speak Polish or when I'm with a few people who were born in the same Jewish section as
I was in Lodz, but the rest of the time I seek the few who are imbued with value of
humanity because unfortunately as time and again when push comes to shove it's the
small minority that comes to the top when they have a chance, the gangsters and others,
give the mafia half a chance and they'll rule, permeate Italian government, you name it.
The bulk of the people care about only what they're going to do and eat the next day and
how they're going to dress their children. For that sake, they're willing to swallow
anything and they will not do much and they will not risk their neck and a small
percentage of what I call elite of humanity are the noblest and the finest. They're seldom
rich. They're seldom on top of the world. They're seldom occupying the highest
positions, but I only seek out those people.

Q: I'm thinking that to some extent you dismissed religion as a contract, I'm wondering what
it is that made you have a need to find your roots? What is important about religion?

A: Which religion?

Q: Any religion and yours that made you need to see him again?

A: I have not sought the Jewish religion if you mean by organized religion. I think that
some of the abuses in the world have been committed in the name of religion. I have not

come back to my roots to seek the Jewish religion, not at all. I've come back to my roots
first of all to make peace with myself not to continue living with self denial. Secondly, to
honor the memory of my father and my mother and my sister. They were who they were
and they were innocently slaughtered and I have no right to deny them. Everything else
in terms of my public identification with many of the manifestations of what we call
religious life, I see so much intellectual corruption and twisting and revision wherever I
turn, be it the Jewish organized life or catholic organized life, so I didn't seek to be
admitted to the bosom of the Jewish religion. It doesn't mean a thing to me. I don't seek
to be an official member of the catholic church either.

Q: I think what I'm asking is, is the Jewish religion for you? I'm not saying going to the
synagogue every Friday night, but does it embody a sense of history a sense of tradition,
a sense of culture.

A: History, tradition, culture, yes.

Q: It's part of you?

A: As far as the widening of the ethical and moral concept of the Jewish bible onto the rest
of humanity, I think that this is what Christianity accomplished although it has been
guilty of many lies such as expropriating the reform Judaism as I call Jesus Christ as a
rabbi, expropriating and in the name of accepting his tenets of love thy neighbor,
murdering Jews which is the most advanced lie and bigotry in the world. But I do believe

that the way of making ethics and morality available to all humanity is the way that I
believe 18:01: it. Call it what you will. If anybody would ask me the catch all question
as to what have been the after effects and the consequences of all these experiences, well
it's like trying to reduce Homer's odyssey down to one paragraph. One can do it only
with sufficient distance, and I think now after some 50 years I think I have achieved
sufficient distance. In my case first of all for many years I had to play many roles. It's
like the seven ages of man from Shakespeare. Until and only recently I stopped playing
roles. In other words, I would bend my behavior to what I felt I should sound like, speak
like, behave and what my attitudes should be to one person versus another person
depending on who they were, Americans, Poles, Jews, etc. So, I played various roles.
That eventually resulted in not only dichotomy, but in some self loathing as to who I am.
That has been the easier part. More difficult part that caused me incessant inner torture
and suffering and 18:03: struggling has been the alienation for most of my life from most
people. So, with the result that I don't trust most people anyway, and the few instances
that someone appeals to me, I tend to go overboard, meaning that I try to make up for
what I lost in growing up, in the love of father, mother, sister, relatives, teachers, peers
and so on, and become periodically over enthusiastic and overtrusting until I get
disappointed but that began to level itself off with age. So, I am absolutely convinced
that my one great regret is that if I didn't have these crippling problems of running away,
of alienation of avoiding deeper relationships, that I could have achieved much more than
I have, and to some degree I have achieved what I was able to do, but in spite of my
problems and difficulties. Three university diplomas and a stint on broadway, starting
my own theater, etc. etc, the rest is in Who's Who in America, but I'm still extremely

dissatisfied with myself because I think I could have and should have achieved more.
When I would go on vacation for example with my second wife who told me that I was
the biggest pain in the neck when I was on vacation because within a day or two I was
already restless and wanting to get back to start another project or get back to work. I
simply could not enjoy vacation because I think deep down I felt that I had no right to
just be merry and mirthful and enjoy myself while all my people had been exterminated.
It's a sense of guilt that every day that I get up that I don't further the cause of either
bearing witness or creating yet another project and justify my survival. Whatever I have
accomplished which by some measure is little, and by other point of view may be I
suppose of note, has happened despite great many personal problems in relating to
people. For example, when I was with CBS and case in point when I worked with Don
Hewitt who is now a big celebrity, creator of 60 minutes etc., this is just a case in point,
not to appear on Entertainment Tonight, but I know that I could have easily been one of
the producers or directors on 60 minutes or soap operas or whatever and I have worked
against myself a critic might say in that when I felt for example that on a soap opera that
the values were trite, that they were mundane, that they were exploitive, I had such
contempt for the people who in view of everything that has happened to this world and to
me personally and to holocaust and all of that, that these people could still deal with these
trite and superficial problems instead of delving deeper into the human conditions for the
edification of themselves and others, that I literally had contempt for those values and I'm
sure that I've shown it and said so a number of times. Well, that's why I'm not a producer
or a director on a soap opera making a quarter million dollars a year today, but it doesn't

matter to me because I would spitting in my face if I build my life around these trite
values.

Q: Do you have the right to enjoy yourself?

A: To me enjoyment is even with no holocaust but simply responding to my education in the
European condition in my field which has been theater and lately expanded into
television maybe film, that simply is being faithful to my profession. A doctor considers
his calling, if he's a good doctor, to treat others and prevent suffering and pain. Well,
being in the theater from which I have emerged professionally, my calling is to examine
the human condition, sometimes through laughter, often seriously. But 18:09: the
triteness and the superficiality that I find in the commercial field to me is repugnant. It's
a violation of every - - it's the same way that a doctor would work only to push as much
penicillin or aspirin as he possibly can only to enrich himself, you know just push
prescriptions.

Q: Can you enjoy a walk on the beach?

A: Oh yes of course I can. But..

Q: Simple pleasures?

A: Yes. But to go off on vacation for more than a few days, I feel guilty and I feel that I am
not doing something worthwhile. You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy Jewish rights.
You don't have to live through the Holocaust to be committed to some deeper values and
the calling of the profession. But I think it's only been exacerbated by my experiences
because I think that I ought to do something meaningful all the time to justify my survival
and in that sense I'm not the ideal person to live with and only think of what fun to
dedicate myself to after working hours. And for many, many years having lost my
family, having lived in so much fear and terror, having felt myself abandoned by my
family, by Jews, by the rest of the world, it was probably inevitable that in personal
relationships for many years, I would construe a small slight as a rejection and then
respond in kind by either more forceful repartee or by running away. In other words,
terminating a relationship, and this has haunted me for many, many years. Until by the
time I was able to gain an insightful look into it, I was getting older. So, that's been the
other after affect but it's like saying someone what is it like giving birth to a child. You
can understand it intellectually, but unless you've gone through all the trepidations and
the enormous pain, you don't really understand it. So, you can talk 18:12: about these
things, but to have lived through the constant terror first to survive, and then to protect
what you construed was your integrity but in fact was a false identity and live in terror of
being unmasked. Because if I was unmasked then I had no place to turn. I had no place
to turn. There was no going back and thee was no going forward, so I had to protect that
carefully constructed false identity and I think this has been the greatest curse of the after
affects. [PAUSE] Well, there is, as you probably know a film made by a Kibbutz
Lokhamei Hagettaoth in Israel some 20 years ago called the 29th blow or 49th Blow or

something. That is somewhat a dramatic of my approach, the conclusion of that film. In
other words, there was a survivor who somehow lived through some 27 blows being
whipped by SS or by the Gestapo. But the worst, the 28th blow was after the war when
he had found out that the world was so little interested in what he had to say. I remember
when we established the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization in 1962 and wanted to
come out with the first commemoration ever of the Warsaw Ghetto heroes that we
couldn't find one Jewish community group or one synagogue in the greater New York
would give us a hall free of charge in which to hold the commemoration. This was
before it became fashionable to attache yourself in more ways than one, socially,
economically, financially, status wise to the word holocaust. And sooner or later of
course it is fall into the hands of the establishment or people who have either economic
ax to grind or want to enrich themselves by publishing this or that. And that hurts but I
suppose that is inevitable, and so we are the last dying breed because when the war broke
out I was 11 which means I was old enough to remember what was going and young
enough to attain my present age and talk about it. But with my generation when we begin
dying out that is the end of those who will bear witness, and then what hurts is that it will
fall into the 18:16: hands of the interpreters, the revisionists, even the honest revisionists
who are going to place this or that emphasis because they will have their own ax to grind.
When you watch a play or a film called Rashomon when a woman was violated and there
were three or four different versions of those who were present. Each had a different
version, then you begin to take the so called holy scriptures, including the epistles, with a
grain of salt because unless every word had been guided by the spirit of God and that has
to be proven as I know the scientific formula for approving the spirits. Whether to what

degree we can trust what will be the witness that will be borne, we have fortunately ways
of recording testimonies which we didn't have 2,000 years ago or more, and maybe for
that reason it will be somewhat better preserved. But what hurts more than anything is
that what happened to our generation will not be properly understood or acted upon and
what hurts even more so is that from what I see the world has not learned and the same
thing 18:18: is liable to occur again and again. I don't know what else to say. I don't
want to say empty phrases. This is a picture about six months old 1927 in Lodz, Poland
of Joseph Kutrzeba born as Josef Arye Fajwiszys about six months old on a bear skin as
was then a habit of placing infants on. This is my father Professor Israel Fajwiszys
approximately 1921 in Lwow pre- war Poland, now Ukraine, born in 1887 in Yampol
which was extreme eastern Poland prior to 1939 but at the time of his birth was Russia.
Well, left to right, a chart whose identity I don't know because I got these pictures after
the war, next to him I believe is my father's mother or my grandmother whom I never
met. Standing next to her is my mother Malka Fajwiszys, maiden name Hakman, born in
Czer.....? Poland. It was Russia, I believe it was 1902. Standing next to her is my father
Professor Israel Fajwiszys and then in the woman's lap is my sister Perla age two which
was about two years before I was planned and next to her I believe was my mother's
sister or cousin, I'm not sure.

Q: When was this picture taken?

A: This picture would have to have been taken in 1925 because my sister was born in 1923
and she looks about two years old here. This is the foursome family picture 1937 in Lodz

Poland, left to right, myself, age about nine. Next my sister Perla called by everyone
Rella, for short. My mother Malka and my father Israel Fajwiszys, composer conductor
among others the best known song all over the world, called MIkhol Massada?_-. I was
extremely unhappy that day. I had been crying for about an hour prior to the picture
being taken I remember, and finally my father had to quiet me down because prior to
going to the photographer I had been saving money in my little savings box for about a
year and my parents decided that I needed a new sweater and they decided to spend all
my savings on that and I thought it was very unfair. This is my elementary school private
class part of the Jewish gymnasium in Lodz, fourth grade if I remember with the men
standing in the back Grevitz, who taught us geography and the sign in the back says
, which means Silesia in Polish. Apparently that week he was teaching us

about , and that's me in the center age about nine. About 1936, '37.
This was as you can see the lower figures ten two forty-five, which means the 10th of
February 1945 almost exactly two months before liberation when I had to go in the city
of Erfurt_ in Germany to obtain a new identity pass because my old one was stolen and I
had to go to the Gestapo, actually SD (Sicherheitsdienst), which was the security officer
of the Gestapo to have a new picture taken with a number as a Polish catholic civilian
laborer in Germany, age not quite 17 I think. A few weeks after my liberation by the
American troops I was an interpreter with the CIC detachment number 220 part of
Patton's third army already wearing an American uniform age still about 17. This would
have been May of 1945. I am on the extreme right standing by the way. This was a
group of us gymnasium kids in the Polish dp camp in Altenstadt, summer of 1946 I was
well 18 I think and myself on the extreme right. The time is 1948 in Munich in front of

the BMW, yes the people who make the cars. The building which was requisitioned by
the American occupying authorities to house the Polish guard company which was an
auxiliary military unit which served the U.S. Army in occupation, and this is a review of
the Polish troops by two American officers, and on the extreme left which is the Polish
commander captain, and I was his adjudant, second lieutenant. I'm the next behind him
in full uniform and white helmet. This was in 1933 the 20th year of the activity of my
father as a conductor was a very festive concert in Lodz Philharmonic of my father which
I believe I may have attended. In fact, I think I remember that I was at age about six. It
was a very festive occasion and this is the original document, the program of that concert
which has the left side are excerpts of two Oratoria and then Jewish folk songs all in
Polish and the right side is in Yiddish. They story very briefly about how the original
came into my hands was that the Yivo Institute, or the Institute of Jewish culture in
Eastern Europe had been established in the 1920s in Wilno, Poland. The original
members of the board was Freud and Einstein and the institute started collecting various
programs and notices and reviews of Jewish culture throughout Poland and the adjacent
countries. When the Germans came, the contents of the museum was confiscated by
Alfred Rosenberg, who despite the name was a Nazi, not Jew. He was minister of
occupied territories. This was taken to a Frankfurt, not destroyed for some reason, and
the American Army found it, was perplexed as to what to do with it and passed it on to
the Yivo Jewish Institute in New York and I found this among other papers and reviews
of my father's concerts 20 years after the war.
