years older than me, she born in 1933. And between us was another girl which —

A: Pardon me?
Q: What did your parents do for a living?
A: Well, my mother, she — her trade was to make ladies’ hats. And she had her — th
—I think wa — the most select clientele in Warsaw, including the — the wife of the
prime minister and people like this. She was very well known, which was working
against her during that period of Nazis, and you know the persecution, so, you
know, it’s good on one side, and depends what the times, can be working against.
Q: And what did your father do for a living?

was what he was doing for a living.
Q: Mm-hm. And was your family very religious?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: My mother family was very progressive, not religious at all. And on my father’s
side they were a little bit more conservative, but no religious. I wouldn’t call them
as [indecipherable] religious.
Q: Did you celebrate holidays, or —
A: Oh yes, we — I understand. I don’t remember that, okay. I mean, they kept the —
the — the — the main holidays and, you know, Sabbath and things like that, you

mara — more or less has give you the idea.
Q: Mm-hm. And what was your sister’s name?
A: Sophie.
Q: Sophie.
A: Sophie. And in the time of wa — when — when — you know, the w-war start and
oh, the troubled times, Sophie was six and a half. And she — she remember, you
know, the wealth and all the happiness pre — pre-war. So affect her much more than
a —than affects me, because I was un — no conscience about my — my own existence
Q: Right.
A: [indecipherable] I did. On — on the age of two, two and a half already, or a little
bit more, I don’t know, 19 — 1942, when the first transport of people have been
taken from the Warsaw ghetto to extermination camp, in that — in that transport
went my family; my — my — my parent — my — o-on both sides, for the exception of
the — my — my mother’s brother, one of them have been killed. I don’t know if
that’s by an accident or what, he be — was a fire on the roof in — in the ghetto. He
went up to the roof, but never came back. He was 25. His name was Ignatius. And
the youngest brother my — of my mother’s, Henry. He was 18 and he — he took
poison, he killed himself. But he was in the underground, the organization, had been

Miriam, his younger sister, she had been taken to the — to the extermination camp
with my — with my grandmother, who at that time was fift — 52 years old. And my
mother was a widow on the age — age of 30. 30? Thir — 31 - 32.
Q: So, after the war started, what ha — what had happened to your family? Did they
try to escape Warsaw, or —
A: No, when my mother — my mother — my mother before the war was always
advising to leave to South America, because a cous — my ma— my — my — my
grandma cousin, first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well. So sa —
always like a possibility which my mother always considered in the thir — in the late
30s. But my — my father was too attached to, you know, position, he wa — the
business was going well, and you know. They thought the war — nothing will
happens, you know, so he was optimistic. So they never fled away. And once was
the war start, like everybody else, we — we have to move into the ghetto. And the
reason why my mom were not ta-taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three
survivors, is because we didn’t live in the same place where my grandmothers live
and the family. And me — my — my father, the older men of the family, he — he was
there with — with the rest when they close and they ah — they emptied the building
and took everybody away. So, my mom was — when she said well — she wa — she

didn’t — she didn’t have any doubts that this is not for taking her to the working
camps, that was for extermination. So she says, I am not waiting here for — for
death, I am — I am running away. If I will be caught on the — on the run, at least I
tried to do something for my life. So she — you know, was corruption, like
everywhere else. So she — she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to
supply us with documents, aray — Aryan documents on the other side. They — they
didn’t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo. So, my mother was waiting and
that took her a little bit more than she — sh-she — es — expect to take. So she was
very am — you know, nervous and watching if the people are coming and bringing
the document. And then sh-she showed me the Gestapo car coming. So from the —
from the back of the building we run away, just in time. So s — as — close calls like
this, we had a couple of them. Even when we was trying to leave Poland after the
war, where the — the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians. So, in order to
get out of Poland to the western Germany was a ri — also risking a life. But coming
back to those times — so we — we left — we left the ghetto, and my mother remember
from her young age that her father was taking the family to spend the summer to a
place called Sandomierz on the south — on — a —a little bit south of Warsaw on the
bank of the Wisla river. And so sh — in order to run from Warsaw, she went there
with us. And that was a mistake, because in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is

Warsaw. And of course those — those voyages cost money, and we — we didn’t
have too man — too much of it. So shortly after bri — getting back to Warsaw, her
economical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just
present herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a
Christian lady who was married to a policeman, also Polish. And she says, well, if
you refuse to help me, I understand. It’s a big risk. But if you can’t, I have no one to
call any more, you know. So — and she, she did so. She said, wait. She hold us all
the day there until the fire — the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to
him by herself. And he comes convince by her — his wife, to help us. And they
advise — the plan when he — what he comes with was the following. My sister, she
was a blonde with blue eyes, that’s no problem. And — so she went to a — with —

Germany. And this way, according to him, she would survive. And I was the
problem, being circumci — and he knew a place where he can take me, but the
condition was, to take kids there — so the kids who have no one, the orphans,
abandoned.
Q: Mm-hm. Mm, right.
A: So — because for security reasons, no visits, nobody coming, nobody know.

there, it’s — it’s my — my place to work, no? And my mother couldn’t do that. Well,
she had — didn’t have a heart to do that, so my poor sister have to di— do this for. So
Q: And — and your sister was how old at this point?

Warsaw, not far from Warsaw, very close to Wilarnow, which is the — the — the —
that was the — the summer palace of the k — the king of Poland in other times. And
the convent where I went to, that was a Methodist, it’s not Catholic, it was
Methodist. So, being Protestants, you know, the Germans didn’t bother them, they

Q: Right.
A: — right? Mas — or were more affinity. The woman who look after us, after the
kids inside, were all Jewish womens. Yeah, for security reasons, you know, so
that’s no — nobody would denounce, you know. Were personally interested, right?
In that’s time I had two years and two months in that time, when I get separate from
my mom. And in — in 1946 in — in April — no, in April of you — April, end of April,
my mom found us, my sister and me, in a— and a ga — in a— in a Jewish orphanage.
That was after the war, in Otwock. And that’s 30 kilometers southeast of Warsaw,
on the eastern bank of the — of the river. In 1945, when the Germans start to retreat,
obviously my sister said something which guides the people who are trying to put
the families together, because they knew about this organization, and — and in no
time I have been bring fr — brought from that place to — to the place where my sister
was. But I was not the only kid, so m-many of them, so I think they was just putting

when my mom comes, I was just re — convalescing from, I don’t know, one of
those, you know, kids things, measles or something like that. So I — I was separate
from the rest of the kids, in order to avoid possible, you know —

A: Crazy. Said, what happened to her, what’s wrong with her? I couldn’t understand
why she’s crying, you know? Well, I was too small to measure the time and
emotions and things like that. And th — since then my life changed. So, after that we
tried to escape from Poland, and we managed to do that. My mom was a very brave
woman, you know. Brave, have guts more than one man — man who would like to

she was a daughter of an officer who was a s — immediate superior to my father av —

Q: Right.
A: And she remarried a Polish man who was in the service, in the — when the —
when the troops occupied Germany, defeat Germany, had been occupied by the
alliances, so he was part of the — of the occupation troop. And he was in the — in
RAF in England, the Polish squadron, and so the — she remarried him. He was a
very, very good man, he was a excellent stepfather for me. Stepfather sounds bad,

Well, and I studied in Spanish and I lived there until I reached the age of 38. Of
course, I get married in the meantime to a Italian girl, a schoolmate, my schoolmate,
and we had four wonderful daughters. I lost my wife 10 years ago.

Q: I’m sorry.

hidden and — you know, on the Christian houses or here and there, and they — and
the — in the churches. Say, I fit perfectly to this category. So — so I get interested,
and that was my fir — first attendance, no re — with no registration, because I learned
the — the same day, or very — very same day about.
Q: Right.
A: Next day was starting day, the — the congress. So I went there. I met lots of
people, different people from different places, and I learn about some — I — I meet
some people who were in Otwock at the same time I were. Of course, now I — now
I remember the [indecipherable]

A: Because I was in the youngest group. But some — some of the people I met, they
do remember my sister, who was seven years older than me.
Q: Right.
A: And so after that, I re — I was very excited about that, and I called my nephew.
Okay, I have to tell you my sister passed away very young, on the age of 46, that
was in 1979. So, I called my — my nephew, and I mention to him that I — because I
knew always [indecipherable] he was very curious about where he is coming from
and whatever, but hi— his story [indecipherable] story. But, you know, my sister as

married to a very nice person, but he was a Christian from the — from Pomerania.
That’s the northern part of Poland, right on the sea, on the Baltic. A very
handsome, nice fellow, so they were — were okay, but the — the tr — all the tradition
and everything what could be, have been lost. So, somehow we were lost for the
Jewish community, right? But my s — nephew always was curious about that, and
that was something which, for obvious reasons, my sister didn’t talk about that.
Q: Right.
A: Because she was hidden, her br — her origin, as my mother did. As long my
mother lived, I never mention my origin. I respect her will because listen, I don’t
know what she went through, what she passed, what make her decide to take this —
to decide that. So I were — I were no one to challenge her decision, so I accept it like
this. Once — once before, she was still alive, I come to the dilemma, what shall I do?
If I shall say to my kids that I am Jewish or not? And that was — ma — ma — my —
my — my daughter was like — my older daughter was like 10 years old, and the next
one was almost nine. And my mother says, you know, this is something, it’s a big
question. I’m not in position to tell you what to do. And after, you know, a—a
pause, she said, if you want to save them — to save them suffering, don’t say it.

A: That was what she told me. But I— I— I—I-— you know, I kept thinking about it,
and finally I told the decision to say it, because in [indecipherable] maybe by
ignorance, some of our — my kids be in the environment where they will come to be
a—maybe anti-Semitic or something like this. That’s what'll be the worst thing
what could happen to me right now. So I said that, and that was the time when my —
my wife learned about my [indecipherable]. And I said, well, don’t — you don’t
have to worry about, because according to the Christian religion, I am a Christian,
never mind ho — how my person is. I have been Christian, I still am Christian. But I
don’t want to deny it, where I’m coming from, and it’s nice to be able to say the
truth. So that’s was years ago, and then once ma — I had contact with Jews in my
trade, because I was in the fur business. And I’d just been exporting fur from
Argentina to Europe [indecipherable] when I matured to do that, before I was a
furrier, then I come to be a wholesaler, and then I comes to be an exporter. But the
people who I knew and I was dealing with almost on the daily basis, most of them
were Jews. Some of them, they come to be very close friends of mine. People much
mature, 30 years older than me. So they — they — they — they lived this period of the
Holocaust entirely differently than I did. They were fi— 16 - 17, you know, young
people, o-or 30 —

me, she is almost 80, she is eight — 79. Very nice person. I was in her house, made a
mention about this photography and I brought that with me, the copy. And she say,
