situation was?

A:In what year?

Q:Well, you tell me. At what point did you realize that this wasn't just a short war or that things
were really very, very, horrible for the Jewish people? When did that begin for you?

A: It begin as soon as we got in into the ghetto. It was you take a human being and lock him up.
Lock me up, but I wasn't -- wasn't ready to be locked up. I was still in my prime life. I
was 39 years of age, and they're going to lock me up. And then the pagrom. What I
couldn't take it is the Lithuanians. I had Lithuanians lawyers, friends. They used to --
like for Passover, for example. I used to take five, six judges coming with me and we
having the Passover services. I was so close. Stenitis (ph). They hadtoldmetwo__.
One was Stenitis, was a good friend of mine, Stenitis. His brother. And say, oh, I
mingled with them, friendly. I know I'm alive because they -- when the city pagrom was
going out -- going around, they come up to my house and stopped. Why? I am positive
sure that one of my friends was Hollincare (ph), say, "You don't go to Ipson. Skip that
house," because I have a feeling that they were going next to me. But I still, still here.
Somebody stopped. Well, that what was a difficult life. And then the nice people, Edna's
family, losing Edna's family in -- in two minutes. And I was hot and angered at the
Jewish police. They didn't have to be involved in that kind of thing. I lost twice people

because of big shots. I could be a police any time. They all life is what's difficult. It was
not what's not difficult. And like with here, a life not concern it does. When I came in
this country, I went to work for Edna's uncle, who was an uncle the Pepsi-Cola owner
from Pepsi-Cola in Munich -- in Richmond. And I worked hard for her uncle. I wouldn't
even let me smoke a cigarette. One day he comes in and he stop where I stay at night and
working, and he tells me, I say, "Well, what you going to do next?" I say, "I don't know
yet." I say, "Well, I got a job for you," her uncle tells me. I say, "What is it?" I say, "To
run my bottle machines. I have troubles with the machines, and the mechanic there is a
drunk. Every day he's drunk, and I'm in troubles. I got to have my equipment working. I
can't make any money. I can't make a living the machines staying still." I say, "What
you want from me?" "I want to give you a better job you got." The job I'm talking, 1947,
he been paying me $65 a week. I say, "Well, I'm not interested in doing nothing." He
say, "I give you $100 week." I say, "Give me $100 a week? What I going to do with
$100?" Well, "Tell me why you won't. What is your reason," he say, "when you were
able to do yourself better." He was a smart man, the old man. I asked him the queston. I
told him, I say, "Look, America is a country of wheels. Everything goes on wheels. You
go stay and look. Go take a look, how many wheels pass by in the minutes we're
standing and talking to each other. Everything goes on wheels, and I want to roll with
them. I don't want you to stop me from rolling. I -- what good is for me your job? I'm
not too much interested." And here I tell you another mistake you made. You know, you
got to be -- in life you got to be careful. Here comes Serret (ph). Serret -- you remember
Serret? Serret was the foreign minister from Israel who was before in Benger Young's
times. And he deliver a speech in Richmond. I was at his speech making. After he
finish speaking, I come with the uncle and I introduce him in Hebrew, introduce him
Serret. And he tells to Serret, "You know, I want to build a plant of Pepsi-Cola in Israel.
Can I do it?" I say, "Sure, you can do it. No question about it. But it will be certain
requirement. You know, one thing that -- Israel got enough grapes, got enough food, and

they can make the syrup, they make from all that stuff from our ingredients." He say,
"Well, but you know, I want to build for my grandchildren," Edna's uncle tells Serret. I
say, "Well," he say, "I build for them a future." Then it made me hot. I say, "You want
me," I say, "go to Israel, vote for you to secure the life for your grandchildren, and my
grandchildren shall work for you? No, I'm not going. I don't want that."

Q:What do you think it was about your background that made you strong, that got you through
all of this the way you did?

A:Made you strong?

Q:That gave you the strength to survive all of this. Was it something about your background?

A:Right. Right.

Q: What?

A:Without my education, I wouldn't be able to accomplish nothing. Everything education helped
me. It was not hard for me. When I took the job, I knew the language. I knew the
history of the people. I knew what to say and what to do. And -- what I should say
"Yes" and not say "No." The only trouble I -- remained after the war me and Edna, but
no more closer people. We couldn't help it. Only want to have a little happiness. More
happiness here right now. I got a good business. Everything all right, but still not
fulfilled.

Q:lt's still not fulfilled?

A:Huh-uh. Still not fulfilled.

Q:After the war when you came over to the Unitedâ€™ States, did you talk -- did -- at least among
your family, did you talk about your experiences?

A:They knew.

Q:I know they knew, but did you talk about it together?

A:Yes. I talked, and they didn't like to hear it, to be honest with you. They didn't -- back 5
I think we are talking. A lot of them they think that I telling a lie, that I am not telling the
truth, because they figure that a person couldn't survive, couldn't go through life with that
kind of a problems all day after day. And they didn't want to listen. They didn't want to
listen. They didn't want me to speak no more. And not only me, all the survivors. Don't
talk. It was a rough time until lately, yeah, the museum helps a little. But until the
museum come, they don't want -- nobody want to listen. I say, "The American people
don't listen to us anyhow. They're used to talking. They are used to doing. It's a waste
of time."

Q:Were you able to put it behind you then?

A:l did. Right now a lot of thing here. When I came in this country ,l gota
brother-in-law here living with me this month, Edna's sister's husband. And I told him,
"Milton, you know, let's go make -- I got a good business for us both together. Let's go in
partners. I got two businesses. One business," I say, "you can pick auto parts. Open up a
business auto parts. You be the salesman. I'll tell you what to sell, you go and sell it,

can run it by yourself. You don't need any help. The machinery runs it, and you make a
living. Only thing you need is to go on out and sell it, to go to the wholesaler -- paper
wholesaler and sell it." And I say, "You would be perfect for me, because you know the
language, and you just got back from the army, and you the right man." "No," he say,
"take it easy. I don't want that kind of business. I don't want it." He is nothing, have
nothing. He's a big nothing. What I beg him to be a member -- a partner with me, and I
have anything I want. I got an apartment. I say I can get him $200,000 and from
fingers. I got a machine shop. I got one piece of machinery just $250, the cranks and
grinder. I have the best machinists in Richmond working for me. Well, and now with
Jay in the business, and Jay already working on his little one, he should be -- yeah. And
first thing he comes in he runs into the computer and types.

Q:What sort of -- how do you feel that your experiences during the war, during the Holocaust,
affected the way you live your life now or the way you lived your life for the last 40
years or so? Do you think it had a lasting impact that made you do things differently or
value certain things differently than you might have?

A:I tell you, I know -- I'm sure I had to do it. I'm sure I done it. While in my business I felt out
that you cannot leave it out a community. You got to be a community person. You got
to see to help, tobe active _â€”_â€”, to be active. And I am. I got more awards -- I say, so
many sticker. But I got a Distinguished Community Service Award. I got a Christian
Jews Conference. I got a Naborite Service Award. I got a Naborite top lot president -- I
got plenty. And it's not because I got pushing it out. No, the way it comes itself. I feel
because I went through life so different variations, movements, that now everybody --
everybody. I say everybody. A lot of people come to me ask advices. Why do they ask
for advices? For my experience. I went through hell. I give my advice. I say, "What's
the matter? You going to tell me I don't know what I'm talking about or you don't know

what you talking about? You don't know what you want. You know what you want. But
you got to make up my mind." People want to go and want to have it done for nothing.
You can't get nothing for nothing. Well --

Q:ls there anything today that frightens you, that takes you right back to that bad period?

A:Right. Didn't I mention to you? Funny how we talk sometimes. I can't remember with whom
I spoke.

Q:Tell me.

A:That now the government repeat, it repeats itself. Particularly Europe. They -- the Balkans,
what's going on in the Balkans is terrible. And who go have the -- we go expect a war
with the Lithuanians and Poles. I don't know. I have a feeling like that, because they
going the same way as they went in 1947, '48.

Q:And that frightens you?

A:That frightens me. Who wants to have it? We had enough. We don't need any wars no more.
And the way it's going now, you never know what's going to happen. They still cannot
settle between theirselves the arguments. The politicians, they are a bunch of no-goods.

Q:ls there anything, just the ordinary life in the United States, that frightens -- that makes you
think of the past and --

A:Yeah, there was a easier life. Now we going -- we going over a new period of life which we

it's a new way of life, and it is changed the human being. In the next 10 years, we don't
go recognize ourself.

Q:But I may be -- I'm not explaining my question very well.

What I'm trying to ask you is, if in just the daily life today there are certain things, certain
sounds, certain things you see or think about, that all of a sudden make you remember something
50 years ago and are very disturbing that bring it back to you?

A:The street life. It is terrible. The murders, murdering, suing each other, children problems.
The cancer problems, cancer sickness. They would kill this cancer when they would put
their mind in it. I don't believe it, it's not that it couldn't be conquered. But every other
thing, all kind of items, and the making the life miserable for their own self in
place of making it beautiful, beautiful life. But they don't straighten out, it will be rough,
because I can see a lot of -- a lot of fights here going on. And, well --

Q:What message should we learn from all of this? From everything you've told me, what should
somebody who's listening to this take away from it, the most important thing?

A:What people should learn from this?

Q:Yeah.

A:They should learn a new life, because a life is now come to a dead point. And mostly land is
controls the people's life. Land and girls, and all the fights with one with each other,
killing each other. Here it's not as bad as in little Richmond. It is a village. It's not a
night for two, three killings. Blacks, whites. Mostly blacks. Whites is not so bad. But
still a human being, I don't care who it is. And something life itself, when itself without

help and change. Life need help. It needs to get out from their assistance. We need to
help the economy got to have a boost. And, well, too much inner fighting between one
and the other. Very, very hard. They still talking?

Q:Yeah. Do you think in the world, is religion really that important?

A:No. No. I don't care about religion. Religion brings no -- we got to be mixed in between one
and another. It's rough. And it started in Iran. It were the biggest problems. And then
there's Lebanon -- the Middle East, another war should come up.

Q:But you are a practicing Jew?

A:Yes.

Q:Religion is important to you?

A:Right. Because -- well, it is religion like here. Listen two weeks ago was a rabbi in
Richmond. He been talking. And he say the only thing what he wants is to conservative,
conservative Jew. And he say there, what we got to do every day, we got to put on
chilum (ph). You know what chilum is? You know up around there. And we got to see
to help and to do and to pray. And it wouldn't give me nothing. All this, what's we get
for the human being. Right now we still don't see nothing. We say -- I didn't see yet
after 50 years to get rid of Hitler would start coming back, everything. Here I've been
talking 50 years ago to the same farmer, Paskofski, living outside and talking to Mr.
Paskofski, "What do you think about life?" That's what we be talking. I'd be asking him
right there by the door from the Holocaust. And he say, "You know, you so right. You
so right." That I say, "Let's -- I can tell you one thing. We still going to have a beautiful

life in front of us. I don't see it yet." Italkto___â€”.x [know him. He came to
Richmond, and I talked with him. I say, "Tell me something. I cannot understand how
come until this day nothing didn't been done about the Holocaust." He say, "Such a
tragedy happen to the Jewish people, what have you done about it? You should know
what to talk. It's you should know how to answer the questions. Where are you? What
you doing? You're telling me__," it's a little story where they mean nothing. He
say, "Let me tell you something. History is not written in a day. History doesn't been
written ina month. History takes years to write. The Holocaust will take 50 years before
the historian will start doing anything." Right. Smart. I say, "You right. I agree with
you on that." But don't wait until 200 years; 50 years is enough. We lived the 50 years,
and now give us what we need. Give us peace. It's enough. I was with him for a good
while. He's a smart man. Some of them didn't like him, but I liked him. He is one of the
prophets. Very interesting.

Q:Is there anything else you want to -- I don't have any more questions. Is there anything else
you want to say?

A:I don't know. The main thing what I want to say was to get ready of thought of Holocaust.
We should never -- not have any Holocaust problems. We should be out of the books.
We should get ready world, all the dopes (ph) and all the sicknesses and all the killings.
It's unbelievable to be seen a person today, a young person start dying because of nothing
been done about it. A week ago a man, a good friend of ours, he's only 56 years of age.
Cancer. All why? Well, his time comes, he got to go, they say. That is their answer.
That's not the answer. The answer is we're not doing enough. I remember when my
grandfather died at what, 56. He was already old man. He died, and he was 56 years of
age, but he can still live another 30. Well, well, sometimes you done a lot of wrong
things to yourself. You can be smart enough. You need help and other people too to

Israel Ipson
December 3, 1995

A:Okay. My name is Israel Ipson. I've been born in Lithuanian in 1911, March 15th, 1911.
And my father was a worker, worked in the brewery. The brewery was in Slobodka.
Why is it the brewery was in a place in Slobodka? You know, the Lithuanians didn't
want to have the industry, what coming up, to the Lithuanians, that they should have it.
The Jews were not allowed to go to work in Kovno, which Kovno was the capital city of
Lithuania, so we had to go to work in Slobodka. Slobodka was a suburb. In Slobodka
lives around 10,000 Jews. Mostly the poor. They didn't have nothing to eat, and it was a
pity. For where I come from a very, very poor family. My grandfather worked in the
brewery with Golswolf Ingleman (ph). My father worked in the brewery. My uncle --
almost everybody in the poor Jews in Lithuanian worked for the brewery. Why? The
owner from the brewery was the Wolfs, Wolf brothers. There were six brothers. The
family were the Wolfs, and they were a very philanthropic family. And they support the
Jews. How? They build the brewery, and everybody almost work for the brewery. They
also invent a time -- used to be a time where full of snowing. In Lithuanian is a lot of full
of snow, and they used to be covered up and drowned in snow. Was sending in with
horses for the brewery to get the people, bring them back to the place of work. That's
how heavy the snow it was. And my father was liked by the brewmeister (ph). The
brewmeister was a German from Bavaria, and he was his helper. Anything -- the war got
to be -- now my father used to do in the brewery, the brewmeister done only sit and got
the taste of the beer, the color. | remember father used to -- I used to bring my father
lunch every day. My mother used to send me potato sweet herring. It would want that
my father should be thirsty, be able to drink the beer and save the tune for the beer, they
call it. And the pilsner and all the names, they funny. And it's the way the poor Jews in
Slobodka, they make their living. Later on when Lithuania become an independent

nation run by a school teacher, or the name Smetona, he gave the Jews more right. What
he done, he brought the Jews away from the brewery. The brewery was filled with ;
but it opened up more industries to the Lithuanians to make him happy. Smetona was a
smart -- very -- was such a nice man. Tried to help also the Jews to participate in the
industry. It shouldn't be any fights between the Jews and the Lithuanians, try to avoid it.
But still after, there's still was plenty bad feeling between one and the other. And what
has happened, the biggest problem I think what it was, the Lithuanians start taking out --
the German took the Lithuanian out and send them to camps to work. They also, the
Russians, the communists, was being picked, like the school teachers, manufacturers, the
richer element of people, they used to be sent to Siberia, blaming them for the things
which not happened. But also the Jews didn't knew nothing about it, but they should be
saying that the Jews kill their own, that take no other Lithuanians to Siberia. Siberia was
a -- the camp, a labor camp. It is a very, very, very miserable place to be. But mostly 90
percent from the people who be sent to Siberia been dead because they didn't seem to
come back alive.

Question: What era are you talking about right now?

A:Siberia.

Q:When you're talking about the Germans and the communists, what year are you talking?

A:Oh, it was in 1941.

Q:You're talking later?

A:Right.

Q:Okay. Let's go back a little. And I want to ask you a little bit more about your family life as a
boy, your religious background.

A:Oh, I see.

Q:Just the lifestyle in Slobodka.

A:Right. Well, I was also came in time when we didn't have any telephones; we didn't have any
lights. used to goin school __ they call it. What was the -- ever was the old person,
knowledgeable, been pitching for pay to the boys to go to hayda (ph), we used to call it.
And at the hayda we used to come in and stay there until, in wintertime, 7:00, 8:00
o'clock at night until it get dark and bring them home. And that was our education to
people. Like my wife was just saying, she speaks good Jewish, the Jewish language. The
Jewish language was a language from childhood you got it up. And I had two rabbis,
because one rabbi was the Hebrew language, another was Jewish. And then we had in
Slobodka a rabbinical seminary. The biggest rabbinical seminary in the world, because
in that time, in 1914, -17, the only thing they knew is to learn the bible. The people was
poor. There was nothing to eat. They were sitting there all day long in the seera (ph),
they call it, it is a rabbinical seminary. And people from all over the world would be
sending their youth to that seminary in Slobodka. It was not only later on -- the later
years grew up, itwas__s with their also young kids been going there to teach to
become a rabbi. But it is really -- the big leaving to be a rabbi at that time, they couldn't
do nothing. They couldn't make it. But they been supported by the American people,
even in Worldâ€™ War'l. They already been sending help to the Jews in Slobodka. The
chief rabbis used to come in here and in speeches speaking through the American Jew to
help the Jews in Slobodka, because all it be these weddings used to come between rabbis
and -- and then the rabbi had a daughter who had got to get married, used to take along

with him the comment of a trip to America and find -- go to the seera to pick a boka (ph),
to pick a learning young man that they should get married and been supported by the
Jews in America. It was a tradition to help the orthodox. And it is still right now in
Slobodka. The seera is in existence now in Israel. They know more in Slobodka, but
after the war they move the chief rabbi, moved him to Israel.

Q:So your boyhood was very involved with religious learning and --

A:Right. And then I was -- after the learning, the religious learning, I went in highâ€™school. It
became the Jews decided to open up a hipper (ph) highâ€™school. And it became the
Germans in 1917 they had a lot of educated people in the army and they decided to stay
in Lithuanian to teach us, and then we had enough people to get a private school going.
And it was like one famous teacher, Karlbah (ph), and he -- in his name was created a
high*school, and it called Karlbah . And then we had also in the Russian language
a highschool. And we had in Lithuanian we had three highâ€™schools. And then we had
the orthodox school was in Kovno. And everybody been happy until Hitler come to
being.

Q:Okay. What -- tell me a little bit about your family. Did you have brothers and sisters?

A:I have -- I had two sisters -- didn't have any brothers -- and they perished in the Holocaust.
And one was married, and the other one was still a girl. She was married, but she was a
famous -- how you call it? Painting. She was a oil painting. She had a name. They ask
her to come to Paris, and she was staying for three months in Paris and learning the

A:Oh, I have, yeah.

Q:Nice family life?

A:Very nice. Well, we been all together until I married. I was staying home with my parents.
And my father, he was a orthodox Jew, and everything -- we used to come to holidays.
We took it together, like the Passover holidays, the high holidays, and we been meet
together. Everybody would come. And the woman -- it was orthodox fashion, the prayer
separate. They have a separation between men and woman. But that reminds me
different moments that they -- I don't know what you call it. A helper who helps the
synagogue. Summis (ph), is that how you call it? Hell. I'll have to skip it. I don't know
how to say in English. They call them a special -- used to go out on every Friday night
and say, "Jews, you got to close the stores. There's all this coming around. Don't
do any business anymore." So someone got to stop them, and they used to stop it. But
everything was fine until 2042 when the war started with Hitler and Stalin and Churchill.
lL used to like to listen to the shortwave radio. And the Jews which was locked up in the
ghetto, we used to come to my place where I lived to hear what's going on in the fronts.
Well, how is Hitler doing? Well, Hitler is winning the war or losing the war? And we
was very interested in this. They come from my working place, which was the airport,
and talking till the group, which used to come to listen to me, what's happened on the
front, how Hitler is doing. And they used to come up. To explain the truth, I was already
scared. They could lock me up and find out about it, because if you were a Kraut. And I
be begging them they shouldn't come no more, because -- and I -- they didn't have a place
nowhere to go, and they still -- I said, "Tell them it's very important." And they were
very interested, like they would be generals, they used to tell me. One would sit here this

way and one would sit that way, and they knew what they were talking about and they
been leading the war.

Q:Okay. Let's -- I don't want to get quite there yet. I still want a few more questions about
before the war began; okay?

A:Uh-huh.

Q:Now, were you -- were there all kinds of sort of -- I'm still trying to learn more about the life
in Slobodka. You got married at what time?

A:l got married in 1931.

Q:And what -- I'm trying to get a sense about the sort of political atmosphere, the cultural
atmosphere. Did you have contact with Lithuanian people? All of that.

A:Let's see. Well, I went -- in Lithuanian after I finished highschool, I went to college, and in
college I took up law. And I was -- liked to stay with law. And I was doing all right. I
have a nice trade, because the law -- Lithuanians who have been all together in groups
mostly going out together and discussing together, going to the -- every evening we used
to come to one or to the other . And until Celingus (ph) was the ringstat (ph) or
justice that come out with the decree that not one Jew cannot practice law until -- not no
Jew. I'm sorry. He didn't mention Jew. He said not one young man who graduated from
college in Lithuania cannot practice law before he got to go in court who working for five
years. After the five years working in the court, he can practice law. I didn't have no
choice, but I still did not have any choice. I couldn't get in to work in the court, because
they answer -- when I used to send application to the courts and ask them for a job in

court, to open it up that I should be able to become a lawyer, the answer used to be all the
time, "Sorry. We don't have any vacancies. We cannot help you." And I couldn't get in
in law.

Q:What year was this?

A:zIt was in 1932. And then one day it was -- it was a lucky moment with the courts. I had to get
a job already. Jay was born and I got married, I had to make a living. My father was
poor. And I took a job as accountant and worked in a big concern (ph). And I worked
there, and one of my buddies, my friends from college, he recognized me that I came to
the government bank to pay a bill, I don't remember, for the company I work through,
because the company asked me to make a deposit and I'm paying. That he was a
Lithuanian. He worked with chief of police. But he also went to the college. He come to
me and say, "Ipson, look. I got something." My name was Ipson. Iposon (ph) in
Lithuanian. "I got something -- good news for you. Don't tell nobody, but I can give you
a tip now." Lithuanian didn't have any mechanical business, like cars, trucks, machinery.
It was a poor farm country, like 87 percent of the Lithuanians was farmer. Then they
didn't have nothing. And now already the countries like -- like now the Balkans, already
they are Czechoslovakia started in their time, Bulgaria. Here no one with fighting with
all that stuff. And Hitler's told this Czechoslovakian, told the League of Nations -- was in
at that time. Like the United Nations, it was the League of Nations. He told the League
of Nations that he wanted Czechoslovakia, said that Czechoslovakia was his. And that
start already in that time beginning all the fights. But -- and I worked at the factory -- at
the company as accountant. And another one came to me, also. He say that's what me a
good job to be is the distributor of Belgian-made motorcycles. That was the F.N. F.N.
stand for _â€”. And I got the job for -- I like the motorcycles. I went to work for the
motorcycles, and that was lucky. I started making money. But it didn't last long. I had

started and the war started and Stalin got in. They divided Europe in two halves: half
Hitler and half Stalin. And they divided that between themselves, and we didn't have
nothing but what we had in the bank. We lost everything. Stalin took away all the few
pennies which we got it together. And I went on a trip to Belgium because of the fact
that they asked me. They want I should could come there. They want to talk with me
about a new contract. Because I am doing good and all that, I had to go to Berlin. And I
came in Berlin. I have relatives. My mother had a aunt living in Berlin, and she was a
beautiful girl. And the owner, her son, from the tobacco factory --___â€”â€”s who was a
factory -- fell in love with her and they got married, and she became a rich girl. Then
when my mother send her a letter said want I should became a doctor and she should give
me a room in her house. Well, and nothing could be worked out with all that, with all the
woman. And then in 1939, September 8th, I was in Belgium. I was in Belgium to the
factory. I was making a contract for the Karmann Ghia. Kristallnacht. You heard about
Kristallnacht? It was the night of Kristallnacht. I didn't know for nothing. I came, and
mother told me and say I should take for her aunt a kilo bada (ph) and to take some -- a
few cheese, and she felt sorry for you, poor relatives they had. But I took it with me and
gave it to them, to my mother's aunt, and I run in not knowingly in the Holocaust in the --
not in the Holocaust, in the Kristallnacht. What means -- Kristallnacht means crystal,
breaking windows, breaking in, the burning stores. Was a tremendous big store I was --
before the war I used to go there, and in house father owned in Germany. And in that
store I used to -- anything -- they used to mark -- anybody who wants to make money
gets $5 when he comes in here -- in Israel and goes to the colby (ph) store -- and go in the
store and ask for a product and can't find it, gets 5 mark. A premium for that. That's how
proud they were with each other. And it was the next year I came there, but it was when
it was Kristallnacht. All ready all over the streets "Juden____â€”â€”s Traboden" (ph) for the
Jews, the Jews not welcome. The Jews cannot come no more into the store. So we didn't
go there no more, because they took away the cars from the Jews and they took away the

businesses, took away the bank accounts. Anything they had, they lost it. Then we
stopped going. And then Hitler -- I mean Churchill used to -- on shortwave radio used to
and tell Stalin, "Be careful, Stalin, you're going to lose your head." And then, "Your
good friend Stalin is getting prepared to fight you." And this was Ribbentrop. Stalin sent
his secretary of state Ribbentrop and -- no, the Hitler sent Ribbentrop and Stalin sent
Molitof (ph). Molitof was for Stalin. They had been getting together one against the
other keeping -- they didn't know what was going on until Churchill got into the act and
started World War IL.

Q:Let me ask you a few personal questions here. You saw what was going on in Europe?

A:Right.

Q:You went back to Lithuania. Did you have any sense that the life you had in Lithuania would
change so dramatically?

A:No. We had -- We had a feeling that -- but to kill people, that the Lithuanians would kill Jews.
Friends which have been with all our life, which I have been staying with them going
through law school, I couldn't imagine that that should happen like that. It was
unbelievable, that we didn't even -- I had a big opportunity to go, but I was already
married. I had a little child. Jay was four at that time, and I -- my hand was tied. I still
say, oh, it still not so bad. It still only right now who is closed (ph) is the poor little Jews,
and the poor little Jews used to come to Lithuanian to find a place of where to hide,
where to live. And I was in that time a young lawyer. I still could take cases, but I -- but
they used to come to me. They open up a office in Vilnius. Vilnius is the capital city of
Poland right now, too. And I've been working out with them papers that they should be
able to go to Japan. The only place that was open for the Jews to go in that time was for

Japan, and everybody was running. But they had to get a visa, a visa from the Jewish
Council. And they find out about me, and, you know, some of them had money to pay
for my work and some of them didn't have any money even. There was -- or they moved
-- or the council moved away to Latvia -- Riga was the capital for Latvia -- ran away
there. I had to go over with them to help them there. It was -- it was rough. But I still
had my home. I didn't have to worry about Hitler, nothing. Only the Polish Jew had the
problem. That we knew through them that it's no good. They came from Russia or from
all this stuff -- the old timers, little towns, come from all over, run into Lithuanian to
become a place where to live.

Q:Let me -- when you were talking about getting the visas for Japan.

A:Right.

Q:Tell me a little bit more about that. Who were you working with? Was that all legal or was
that difficult?

A:No, it was not difficult, but two years ago it was the council who done -- what give visas. He
didn't have the right to give, but he give it the visa. Nobody knows he gave out -- about
5,000 visas he gave out. It was not legal. If it was legal to travel, it was legal to receive
it. But his government didn't told him he should give visas, but at the same time his
government also keep a closed eye, didn't see nothing what's coming at all. But that was
a good man, and he decided to help Jews, Jews in that --

Q:Did you know him?

A:I knew him -- right. I knew him before the war.

Q:What was his name?

A:Oh, I can't tell you.

Q:Was it Sugihara (ph)?

A:I think something like that. Why, you knew him? You heard of him?

Q:Yeah. I was wanting to know a little more about him if you knew him personally.

A:No. I don't remember so much, no. It was a lot of pain there, too. I remember it was a case I
received a visa for a tenor, a singer. Schwartz was his name. He was a terrific opera
singer. And he received a visa, but his name was Silver. And -- now I remember, the
name of Silver come up a day before and took away the wrong -- the visa with -- the men
had to get it, and he got it, the visa, and went to Japan. Later on it was a little easier
because South Africa also had been given some -- letting in some Jews and it wasn't so
bad. Then -- well, one day hell broke loose. Lithuanian or Kovno or Slobodka, was in
the valley surrounded by mountains. Beautiful, beautiful in nature. There was a little
cabin with -- Napoleon built it, and there were a lot of people who was going -- all kind
of talented people were going there in that little cabin painting and writing. It was a
famous writer of All Mapoo (ph), and he wrote two books, it was about that little house.
It was terrific. And the university been built it there, the engineering department. When
the party (ph) go and the people been living there. And it was everybody were happy.
Everybody been in its place. It was status quo for years. And here, boom, Hitler didn't
say nothing, didn't announce that they . In fact, Stalin -- Stalin was living in the

. Iwas in Moscow from time of the war. I was the only for a month. I had to go to get
supplies. Well, it's so much stuff of there to talk.

Q:Wait, I want to be clear on this. When the Russians took over in 1940 --

A:Uh-huh.

Q:-- you lost your money. Did you continue in the motorcycle business or did you do something
else?

A:I couldn't. The Russians confiscated everything. There was no private industry.

Q:So what did you do?

A:lIt was bad. I went to work with older already at the airport. You see what's happened,
Lithuanian didn't have a airport. It was a big mud -- mud field. When it used was to
snow and water, they didn't have any ground. And they had to have a airport because the
war was going away in Moscow. Hitler been pushing Stalin, that he wants to take
Moscow and didn't have no airport. That's why they got to have a place to let the planes
go, and that's what he started with pushing strong. But Moscow was saved by the
Siberiacs (ph), they call it, small, little people. They were mean, and they were ones who
stopped Hitler by 15 miles from Moscow. Couldn't move. And that's why they start
losing with Stalingrad and start losing the war.

Q:When were you in Moscow, do you remember?

A:Moscow in 1943.

Q:Later. Okay.

A:Right.

Q:All right. So you said that everything changed when the Germans came in; is that right?

A:Right.

Q:Can you tell me what you were doing, what happened?

A:You know, when the war broke, we all -- it was on a Sunday morning. We all run out in the
streets. It was 5:00 o'clock in the morning, and we didn't know what's going on. We was
-- we get -- people got so lost. They was running like wild. Run into me, "What you
going to do?" Run into them, "What you going to do? Are you going by train? Are you
going by boat? How are you going to run away?" People got confused. You wouldn't
believe it. You know, "What's happening?" Hitler dropped two bombs. One bomb they
dropped right over the railroad bridge. It's they wanted the bridge to be destroyed.
Another one they dropped right by Slobodka. There was a big field, thatâ€™ what all the
selection was, those who live and those who die. Then -- then people didn't know what to
do. And I was working in that time in the transportation company. Worked with the
transportation horse and buggies. Around 50 horse and buggies, I don't know, got
together, and I was their secretary, organized the horse and buggy transportation
committee, and we made a living from that. It's as long you were a tail (ph), you went in
the system from Stalin, Stalin was happy. Then he didn't bother us that we made a living.
As soon as Stalin used to come with the all kind of directions, you already lost. You had
troubles. And then when the in that time we had a week without a government.

You see, even the Germans, the murderers, couldn't take it no more when they find out
what the Germans -- the Lithuanians doing to the Jews. They made pogroms. You know
what a pogrom is? They been attacking them. And if you had a street, you would go.
You will go the long street, go from the bridge going on the way -- there was a way going
you could go to Moscow. If you go to Moscow and you got a car and you can go fast, I
can understand. But here, they are going with little children, pushing children's carts,
pushing to Moscow. But from Moscow -- from Kovno to Moscow was 1175 miles, and
they going with horse and buggy. And they'll never can reach there, because here was
already flying the Germans airplanes dropping them over the walking people and killing
people in the street. You could see here, boom, right lane already send people been killed
going to Moscow. They couldn't go nowhere. You had to turn around and go back
home. We had no choice. And I had a little girl, a little girl who was three months old. I
had to go with girl, and I had a horse and buggy, but the copper wheels they had before
they were, and it wasn't. I was the owner -- the, not the owner. The owner was Stalin.
And I went there and I took him. There was nobody. "Where is the manager?" The
manager took also one and he run away. Then I took that horse and buggy, and I went on
the way to Moscow, but went until 50 miles I had to turn around and go back. Then I go
in back, Edna tells me -- my wife tells me, "I got to have milk for the girl." I went out to
the farmer house and I talk with the farmer and his wife, see if they can sell me some
milk. They sold me some milk. And they said, "Where are you going?" I say, "I am
going to Kaunas." "Don't go," they tell me, "Don't go. They're killing Jews, and they
going to kill you. You stay away from this road." The farmer -- I was lucky -- they told
me. And I told to Edna, I say, "You know, Edna, we better go with the bad streets,
second way road, not to go with the highway. The highway we'll go, we'll get running in
with the people taking to the fortress where they're killing Jews. Isn't that the way -- we
start going to the worser place. Not to go for the highway, but to go where the second --
second grade road. And that saved our life. And we came in Slobodka. I see my father

twice -- going in front of us. I say -- going face run into us. I say, "What's the matter?"
"Are you survived? Gosh, you're lucky." And I looked at Edna's father. His hair is
white. He was a black-headed man, and he looked terrible. I say, "What's happened?"
He said, "Don't ask. There is -- they're still laying." He said, "Last night they killed all
the Jews. They kill the blacksmith," whom I know, "and the printer," whom I know. The
man from the Zionist organization, they killed him. They killed -- from house to house
they been walking and kill now Jews ___ the street. Killed close to a hundred people.
And like it was terrible. I went up in the attic and looked a little. All along the killed
people laying in the back of the street. And next day they went running, the Lithuanians,
from house to house picking a group of murdered people, and the cemetery wasn't too far,
and they bury them and in probably grave. And it was terrible. Since then, I decide not
to go out even for the street, and___â€”I don't know it's interested. I don't know. It was
very -- a very religious man came to me. Before the war was a famous rabbi, Rabbi Itrac
Elholan (ph). They have here a lot of seminars in that man's name. He was a very, very,
high educated, religious man. Called him Itrac Elholan. And his assistant, assistant
rabbi, the assistant rabbi came to me. I was home, and he tell me I got to help the Jews. I
said, "I got to help the Jews? What are you talking about?" He said, "You got see
Jordan. We got now a Gestapo lieutenant. He's terrible, killing all the people." I say,
"What you mean? He say, "He's in charge over the Jews, and it's all give the right to the
Lithuanians, do with the Jews what you want. Kill them. Do them. We want to liquidate
the Jews people." That's what he say. I say, "What do you want from me?" He say,
"You had when you were in your younger days," he tells me about this story of Esther in
the bible. You know, Esther. You know Esther. And Esther also went to Ahasuerus, to
the king, and to Babylonians, and asked mercy for the Jews then, and they survived.

she's willing to go and talk to Jordan he should save the Jews, not to kill the Jews. And
she don't care about her life. They can kill her. She's going. "What you want now?"
"And now I want you" -- that I should go and talk with Jordan, the German lieutenant that
was in charge, and ask him for mercy to help the Jews. Well, I say "Yeah, but the girl
does it, and let's find out. "Yeah," I say, "I'll do it." I went, and I almost got killed right
by his door. You see, I open up the door. I went into his office, and he say, "What you
doing? What you want?" I say, "I got to speak to you." And I tell (ph) him with his title,
and -- Gestapo title, and he jump to his gun and grabbed the gun and start shoot. And he
start shooting. I run, and I took off right behind the building and come back in ghetto. I
was lucky that that thing was cold, because in that time I seen -- we had a sexton in by
the Gestapo building, what they call it? What it was La Tucas (ph). That is Ukus (ph)
means let the Lithuanian Ukus, th crown department from the Lithuanians. And I come
running, and they -- I see in there, they put in Jews right in that La Tucas gate. There is a
big yard surrounded with the wire, barbed wire, and they put that place on fire. And the
staysand___ go, and put it by the match and blew up the place. And didn't the people
to run out to save their life. They didn't let us go, just stay and shooting them. And they
been catching Jews in the street and taking them to jail. They callthe a jail. They
call it tomb. They're packed up. The jail full. And here it was for a month in jail. I was
lucky to get out because I had a pack of cigarettes, but I have to give one cigarette at a
time to certain people to see how to move out from the jail. I got out of jail and come
back home.

Q:How long were you in the jail?

A:A month.

Q:A whole month? Your family, did they -- did you see them?

A:No, I didn't see them, but I didn't have no choice of -- I trying to go in there when I could. But
then it would start I signed up for to work at the airport. I work at the -- I will be
agreeable to work at the airport, they could let me out from jail. But what's the thing, the
Jewish people that were afraid to go to work. And the airport was the worsest working
place where the person can get -- how the ghetto exist? The ghetto been existing from
cabbage, what the Germans been giving the Jews for working for the airport. The airport
was a company, a German company, by the name of Mole (ph), Mole Company. Mole
Company to cover the building of fixing up that airport that they should have a place
where to come down with the planes. And they used to have a rough time to get workers.
Jews didn't want to -- want to work. They did not get nothing to eat and didn't get any
place to work. They say they're better one to get killed. They don't want to go at airport.
That's___â€”_â€”s what the wife tell before. And they decide not to go to work. So Jordan
came himself one early morning and start -- and it was the four Jews. They evading the
place where not to go to work, and he kill all the four without even asking, nothing. They
didn't done a thing. But he want to scare the Jews when they gave the order to go to work
to airport -- and at airport doesn't mean nothing -- they got to go to work. And then they
made no choice, got to go to the airport. Go to the airport to work was no picnic. There
was nothing to eat. It's what I say. They used to give us a lunch, cabbage with water.
Once a month that's the little slice of meat, but it was horse meat. They used to bring
dead horses, killing them, and give them to the Jews for meat. It was -- it was a terrible.
But you didn't have no choice. I lost two fingers. I've been staying and working -- the
way they do it to make the airport, to build the airport, they been bringing gravel and put
itin__ full for the farmer to bring in so many buckets of gravel, and put the gravel on
top, and putting the 12-feet high -- no, it was 12 -- they had 12-feet high. No, 36. It was

them and shovel it with their father, and their father would bring it up. And it used work
maybe by 50,000 people -- lots of soldiers and Jews -- and building the airport. Then a
man comes to the wagon of gravel. I ask him, a Lithuanian, he's a Lithuania farmer,
"Where are you from?" He tells me, "I'm from____. Isay"___â€”.Â£": The name is
familiar. I say, "What you doing?" And he say, "I'm a farmer." "What you doing here?"
He said, "We got a order from Hitler that we got to bring so many wagon of gravel, and
he don't care were it be." I say, "75 miles away?" He said what he cares. It will take him
a month to bring the wagon with gravel, but he going to have 10,000 wagon gravel to
build airport. That's all what he's interested in, that's the way he figure. And I say, "Why

miles from here." I said, "Wait a minute. Maybe you hear from the Jew by the name of
Itska Kolominski (ph)." He opens up his eyes. "Yeah," and looks around, "He's a Jew."
I say, "I know he's a Jew." "Who is he?" He say, "He's my neighbor. Itska Kolominski,
he never went in the ghetto. He didn't go in." I say to him, "Well, where is he now?" He
say, "He's in hiding. We hiding him. The farmer's already been hiding him because he
done him so good and helped him. They pay him back. And they -- he been in hiding."
And I say, "Can you take a letter to him?" He say "Sure." And I took a piece of paper, I
write up a letter. I told him that his family already, he don't have nobody left, only me
and Edna and Jay, because her parents she got into the__, they took away her family.

A:Right.

A:Right. Right.

Q:Let you finish.

A:And then I went -- we decide -- yeah, in that time decided take these little children, called a

"Well, we got to run." She say, "What you mean we got to run?" "You lost your family;
you have nobody. I got my family, they also. I ask, and we got to do something." And
we still organizing. I say, "We got to go fast. We cannot play. We got to move it. We
got to see to get out of that situation." And she say, "Well, how are we going do that?" I
say -- I told her I sent a letter to her uncle and see what if come the answer. Ina
month, not quite a month, the farmer come back and from her uncle a letter. And he
writes he's willing to. He got to save the family. It's all that's left. Let's do something. I

Q:Now, all of this time, from the early part of the ghetto in the summer of 1941 until '43, you
were working at the airport?

A:Right.

Q:The whole time?

A:The whole time. I think that -- it was hard to get in good place. You didn't have no choice.
You got to work. That's all I got -- started up with the police, and they say not to go to
work. They say it's terrible. And then we got to go in and fight, and start fighting with
all that mess. Even I have a lot of people who I knew very well, with whom I went to the
school together. Here's Golub. You maybe heard. You got it -- you talk yesterday here
about a book he wrote about a ghetto, ghetto day by day, and he's become now professor.

Q:What is the name we know him by?

A:You'll know him by the name of -- he wrote a book, ghetto day by day.

Q:Right. Are you talking about Avraham Tory?

A:Right. Avraham Tory. that's it. You met him? He went to school with me in highschool, in
college. He's also a lawyer. We went to all -- and he was -- what is the Gestapo? .
No, I forgot his name. The head of the Gestapo. He was his secretary. Golub was --
Avraham Golub, Tory, was his helper. Well, and -- what I stop --

Q:Well, you were saying that you knew a lot of people, but you still were working in the airport.

A:Right. Right. Well, then, we took -- I wrote a letter to an uncle that we want to come to him.
And he hired -- he got another farmer, which he helped a lot. Marches (ph).

Q:Okay. I don't want to get on that quite yet.

A:Right. I know what you --

Q:I want to ask you a lot more about the ghetto life.

A:Right.

Q:And we have a few more minutes on this tape, so should I just ask you some --

A:Yeah.

Q:Okay. When you -- when the ghetto was formed, you were already living in that area or you
had to move? What happened?

A:No. I was living already in that area. I forgot it. What the biggest problem, it's what's should
come up and I forgot to mention to talk, and I got to talk now, is the selections, left and
right, who should live and who should die. I got to go over that, too.

Q:Yeah, we'll get to all of that. But I'm just trying -- let's go back a little bit to the summer of
1941 and how the ghetto came about.

A:Right. Well, after the pograms and after the Lithuanians got happy and killed the Jews, they
decide, the Germans, to get over, and the Germans start get bringing more to order,
because they find out that way, the way the Lithuanians went, they'll never accomplish
nothing, and it would be bad for the Jews and bad for the Lithuanians. They got -- they
got to get it straight, and it's what they started to straighten them up. And then we
decided to run out of ghetto. One night I got Jay ready and talked to Edna, talk to him a
couple times. But he was a kid, five years. I got to get him in his mind that he should
listen, because we were afraid to take and do something. And the only way we could
take him out from the ghetto was to put him in -- in the small ghetto was a place where
they run -- people been running out from the small ghetto to the big ghetto. And that's
the way they survived, together they run out in the part of Lithuania in the fields, in the
woods. Oh, but Hitler decided he got to kill every one, and Himmler gave the victory
order to get the Jews locked up and get rid of them, to have the Ninth Fortress, and they
got to kill them. The first thing they done is get a order that the Jews not allowed to walk
the sidewalk. They got to use the gutter. They walk in the gutter. The Jews, the second
decree -- Hitler was in Golub's book, I think, saying the same thing. The second degree
was when the Jews got to wear the star of David on the front and in the back. Why on
both sides when the one side would be enough? They say, no, when they see a Jew they
got to kill him. That is a point where they set up the shotgun or the rifle to -- star of
David, to kill him. And a Jew doesn't have the right to have a car. They took away the
cars from them. A Jew don't have the right to have a secretary, to have an accountant to
work for him. Nothing. And it was rough. But -- and the Jew -- and the main thing, they
got to go to work at the airport. And we'll pick them up 7:00 o'clock in the mrning every
day and take them to the airport to work. And it was also the airport there to work. It's
Jordan, he was the one in that time. He was Miller, the head from the Gestapo, he was
his assistant. And Avraham Tory worked also with the same Miller.

Tape 2

Q:Okay. I just wanted to clarify a few points you made earlier. You talked about trying to get
out of Lithuania in the very beginning when the Germans came in and how you were able
to get horses and buggies and all of this, even though it didn't work. Why is -- did
everybody have that opportunity?

A:No. You see, when the war -- on a Sunday morning, the Germans were commencing to drop
two bombs: the one on the way to the bridge and another one right close to the ghetto.
And they were what scared the living out of many people. This special bomb must be
such a blast that everybody not run out -- fall out from bed and come running out outside.
And didn't know what to do, had the people like crazy. It maybe was thousand people in
the street waiting for a solution. Somebody said "Help them." Even it got so confused is
when the younger couples who was, where they only had to go to the railroad station.
The communists kept a train at the train station for almost a full day begging everybody
to go in the train and go to Moscow. They want to -- they are willing to carry them to
Moscow, and the train was staying there. And they wait and they didn't go and they
didn't use their opportunity and they got killed. You see, other ones went with horse and
buggy. Where they got the horse and buggy? They had a cooperative, a cooperative, to
tell the Russian people. They had to tell what all the private horse and buggy people.
Like I got uncles, my three uncles, they were owners. The horse and buggy they want
only to belong to the cooperative, because they were afraid for the Russians. They say
who -- those who work, those who eat. And they were so scared that they don't go get
any food, that they board a horse and buggy and joined up into the transportation
cooperation that they should say that they got some work and they been doing work. And

work, what they made a living out of it. And how is me by being educated? And I got
my two uncles, three uncles, right in the board of that cooperation. Through their
influence, I been accepted on the job to be their bookkeeper. Then I went carrying their
books, and I got calls, people been calling in. They want to bring -- they found each
other, they want to bring up a safe on first floor, on the second floor, all that kind of
work. They used to call mein. I used to give it all to the dispatchers, and they used to do
the work. And then it's the way we've been working with the transportation. With me, if
you had a place like a stable, a lot stable, which we kept about 30 horses with wagons,
and people were running to that place there for a horse and the wagon. They go off with
the horse and wagon. Was going to Moscow, going to save himself in Moscow. Going
1800 miles, go over in the horse and wagon. They didn't realize they what foolishness
they were trying to do, but when a person is scared and the devil is after him and chasing
him, they don't have no choice. They do a lot of things what is not real for a regular
person. But they done it. The Germans were on top flying over the heads with the little
planes. Lithuania only had two paper cups, I call it, two of them. They didn't have any
more. It was a poor nation. That's all they had. They had eggs plenty, chickens, turkey.
That kind of items they have: food to eat. And that's what they struggle even right now,
here right at the present time, with the__and all what's going on. There the
Lithuanians all struggle to the Russians. Can't help it. They'll have to have a war. I don't
know why. I hope not, but what the way it's happened, the way it's going on, it's big
troubles. Because the Russian who been born 50 years ago is now a man of 50 years. He
may be educated, maybe he's a doctor, a lawyer, and here he cannot practice no more and
he's got to move on. And he say, "What, it's my country." He say, "I was born here."
And you see this all coming up. It's all kind of problems is developing. And the
Lithuanians from their side was trying to do the best they can, and they can't do it and it
doesn't work. Well, when they got in, the Germans, and the Lithuanians lose, it were the
Lithuanians done the biggest mistake: kill the Jews. It's not kill the Jews; it's destroying

the Jewish nation. The Jews done so much good for them. And even right now they been
going and asking in Israel for help, because they got to go to France, they got to go to
England, they got to go the States, seeing that to recognize their independence, to
recognize them as a nation. I one time came to the German Council in Richmond, and I
was right at a meeting speaking to us, and I ask him a question. I say, "Would you tell
me what's happened to Kennicksburg (ph)?" Kennicksburg is one of the largest cities in
north Germany, and there was a population of around 5 million German, and the
Lithuanians took in maybe 5 million Germans. It wouldn't be a Lithuania. And the
problem is -- the United Nations all have problems how to get it straight again. It's
headaches -- Europe is in problems.

Q:Right. Okay. But --

A: Well, then, they came. When the Germans decided to get the force, the labor force, was we
were locked up, 17,000 Jews, in Slobodka before the war started with Hitler and Stalin.
And they -- I got to think.

Q:Let me -- let's go back a minute. I've now learned that you were -- you had a good position in
the transportation cooperative, because of your education and your uncles and your
family. Why did somebody in the community come to you in the beginning to go talk to
Jordan?

A:Jordan was the lieutenant.

Q:Yeah.

A:Because they -- that rabbi knew me personally from way before the war. He was the President
Smetona's good friend. And anything -- when he had to write a letter or something or
something to ask the President Smetona for help, he used to come to me and ask me I
should write him in the Lithuania language a letter. Or when he used to send a letter to
Roosevelt right in the States, he used to come also to me and ask me to help him to write
in English, even when I didn't know the English language. He didn't took "No" for an
answer. I say, "Your own sister-in-law works for Shell," Shell company, the gasoline. I
say, "Why don't you go to your own sister-in-law? She can help you more in this case
than I can." But he didn't want to. He want me. And I couldn't help him. To satisfy him
I say maybe I'll -- maybe he's an ordinary person who got feelings. I'll go. What am I
going to lose? More so than the death, it couldn't be. And I went. And I went to the side
streets. I know to the university was right there. Then I used to go every night and knew
the places where to go. I went, but I almost got my head cut off.

Q:So because of your education, you were able to help people in ways that maybe some people
could not?

A:Not, no. I couldn't. Everybody had -- in the ghetto was such a life that everybody got to help
themself. You don't help yourself, you lost. And nobody could help you.

Q:So after a while the education didn't matter?

A:Didn't matter. It matter was a good little corner where there is room in the living, can serve
you a loaf of bread for a -- a two pair of stockings for a woman. Or earrings, with a
golden earing. You see, when also the Germans come out with the decree, they want to
have the Jewish people should give all their gold, jewelry, and diamonds, to turn it in into
the central committee. And they -- later on they'll have new orders, and when they got

that order, and the Jews, not so dumb, were giving away all their valuables for they had it
for years. Then some of them -- one was my father-in-law. Took out a brick from the
wall, and done such a beautiful job that you couldn't tell. He put in his gold _ watch, he
putting in -- his wife had a chain, a golden chain around her neck that's plain solid gold.
He took that and put it all in the hole from the brick, and put it over with tape, taped it up,
and you couldn't even tell. And it come up after we come after we got liberated, we went
and got to find the gold pieces right in the wall where he put it in. And then it was --
well, this is one item. And then we went and then to go to work at the airport -- no, it
was the second time, then the Germans decided they got to have the airport still done,
with the company, it was a German company, been building the airport. And everybody
had to go to work regardless. It took all the brigades and turn around and send all of
them to the airport delivering gravel to help the airport done. And they done it in a hurry,
in no time, but they work day and night. And one brigade I work at night, I cut my
fingers off.

Q:Let me now, let's just talk about the ghetto for a while; okay?

A:Okay.

Q:If you don't mind. You said before that after the Germans took over there were all kinds of
laws, what Jews could and could not do. Then soon after, did they decide you had to go
live in a ghetto? When did that happen?

A:No. They -- all of they gave that the Jews had the right they should build theirself a ghetto.
And what they done from the Jewish people theirself, to pick out a large brigade, what
they went in in the ghetto with barbed wire in the section with 27,000 Jews lived in it.
They surrounded them with barbed wire, and had Jewish police with helpers staying there

at the gate, where you going in and going out from the ghetto, staying there and helping
the Germans who getting already there -- you say to German soldier and just stay the
Jewish with young men, and all day long stand by the gate to help each other how to not
to run in any troubles. To help there shouldn't be any shooting, shouldn't be any killing.
And then that's the way they stay there and build the ghetto. And not that the ghetto was
finished. Was in Augustâ€™ 15, 1941, that's when they got finished, and they started in June
29th in 1941.

Q:Now, did you have to move into this ghetto?

A:No, I didn't, because I lived there already. My whole family -- my family and Edna's family,
we all were in that same apartment. We had been sleeping four, five people in one room
on the floor, but we didn't want to move away. You stay -- better stay in the one place
and not to keep moving around. And we -- we been there all the time. Since I got
married, I was in together with them, and we stay all in the same place. And only when
they need the help -- they used to come, the Germans, right on the corner where I lived,
come with trucks and pick them up and take them to work. And one thing would just
happen. When they come with trucks to work, it can -- this idea was from the mayor
from Kovno, from Kaunas, came with a smart idea. He come to Jordan, and told Jordan
that he got to do -- to get more people to do work, and the people are not coming.
Something, they got to do to keep them moving. And they came in one day and shot four
people by the gate by coming in and going out to scare the Jews. And when they all
come here, they shouldn't run, they should go to work. And it come -- he come up with
the idea that he need 530 -- 500 people he need first. And he got to have young people.
What he need them? He need them for the archives, because of the communists run away
and left behind him so many papers, so many archives, in the Russian language, and the
Jews knew Russian language perfect, that the Jews should go and help the -- how to take

out the paper and check them, and then know what's all about them in the paper. And
who was idea is? The idea was the mayor from Kaunas; he suggested it. And they took
five -- placed the 500 -- 534 people came. And all of the 534 young people -- boyfriends
of mine, cousins of mine, a lot of people whom I knew, a lot of them I went to school
together. All this appeared at night and everybody was there. They kill them the same
night. When they took them out 7:00 o'clock in the morning, by 10:00 o'clock at night
they all were dead.

Q:Now, why didn't you have to go with them?

A:That's what I don't know. A power in me told me not to go. I just until this day ask -- rabbis
ask people why I didn't -- I stayed with them. And there was my house. And I told it to
my buddy next to me, I say, "You know, I kind of feel funny. I don't think I'll go." He
say, "You're crazy. What you going to do all day long here with the woman. They'll run
you nuts. Where my husband, where is this and that. Stay here. They don't come in time
back, it will be murder." But, I said, "Nope. I'm sorry. I'm not going. You want to go
with me, let's go." "No," he say, "I'm going," and he went with them. And I went back to
the office from the committee. What we call them? You know, I went to the central
committee office with Dr.â€˜Elkes, the head man was there, and Avraham Tory, his office
was there. I went back there and to find out what's going on. Icome in there. There is a
good friend of mine and a good friend of Edna, worked for his brother. He gives me --
grabs me and he want I should go with the 534. And something in me gets me power in
me, I should get rid of him. I say, "Now, look Isaaci (ph)" -- his name was Isaac. I say,
"Don't play with me. I come to ask you what's going on with 534? What's happening to
the young men? What do you want me to push there? What's the interest you got in
me?" He say, "Look, I don't want nothing. You go with them." And it made me hot. I

had -- I had to knock him in his nose. I didn't want to do him any harm, but he -- my life
depended and he stops me. It was three, four cases like this in the ghetto.

Q:So nobody forced you or --

A:He forced me? Nobody forced me, no. No.

Q:Now, all of the people who didn't live in the ghetto area before --

A:Uh-huh.

Q:-- how did they come in? I mean, how did they find places? Was there some organization to
help them?

A:No. It was going -- because Hitler or the Gestapo let them until August 15 we got to have a
ghetto created. We got to have also until Septemberâ€™ 15 a bridge made, and then they
went to -- we went to work. The people who didn't live in the ghetto who went to work
and helped build the ghetto, because they find out that is safer, because they say they've
been guarded by the German, guarded by the Jews, and we don't have to worry about it so
much at night when you go to sleep that somebody will wake you up and take you out
and beat you and kill you and all, what they call it, selections. The 534 was a selection.
They picked out the young men, and it is the cream of the crop for many reasons. Not
only for the paperwork, but they were a power. It was an underground it was in the 534.
It what the ghetto needed, and the young people understood it, but they were not ready. It
wasn't so simple to do. But the main reason was that they should be organized to get
something to fight the German before they go in the ghetto.

Q:Okay. But all of the people who maybe lived not in Slobodka before the war, they had to
come to the ghetto also?

A:Right.

Q:Did anyone help them or did they just sort of come over there and find places?

A:No. It was like one went to the other neighbor or a friend whom he knew or a friend who
came in and swapped the houses, swapped rooms. It been swapping. "Here you take
mine in the comers, and I'll take you what you outside out by the field." They been
swapping between theirself, and nobody helped them and nobody bothered them. It was
a big mistake and it was a big mess. Everybody was running, doing anything they can to
help theirself or help the other one. It didn't work. Then they stop it. Started -- and they
find out that they don't have enough space. They got to have a bigger, larger ghetto.
They had one large ghetto and they had one small ghetto. The small ghetto was 5,000
Jews, and the large ghetto was 27,000 Jews. And to go in the small one, they didn't have
enough more room, since a lot of Jews were -- because Germany decided to send Jews
from Austria, to send Jews from other countries, to Lithuania, to Kaunas, to the Ninth
Fortress, that killed the Jews, and it was the selection. And they build a bridge from one
ghetto to the other, from the small one to the big one. And in the big one they still have
room to put in, but in the small ghetto they didn't have no more. And I -- what they done,
they told everybody, all small and big, say, "Go out in the large field." It was where they
were building the airport. It's where they have the -- what they call it? Rockstaten (ph),
the work places. And they all been sent there. But there they got a select, and the name
-- a German soldier by the name of Rauca -- Jay got his picture of a writeup with him.
He was the head of the selection. And he had the help of the Lithuanians. They helped
to guard so the Jews shouldn't run. And they was directing the Selection A and B, big

ghetto and small ghetto, who should live and who should die. And then after everybody
come around and stay there all morning. I will never forget. From 5:00 o'clock in the
morning until 10:00 o'clock at night without food, without water, without nothing. Andit
was little children, sick people, unbathed. It was a terrible picture, seeing the way they
been mistreating. Mistreating -- the people wanted they should be shot, but they didn't --
surrounded them with machine guns around the all -- around the ghetto, and they kept
them all day. And then Rauca come around with a little stick, like you would play music,
play an orchestra, directing all what to do, and asked everybody's occupation,
everybody's name. And then after a while, we seen a German on a motorcycle come
running and told Rauca something. And Rauca gave the order, "Everybody home. We
don't need it. Go home." Well, they were trying to, the Germans, to find out how much
time and what kind of power it will take to control a situation like this, because they were
afraid for the balance of the Jews. After all, about 40,000 or even 30,000 Jews, it's a lot
of people. They cannot take and 40,000 and shoot them out. Somebody will get ahold of
guns and somebody will get ahold of machine guns, and in worse cases like that it's not
so shameful. Well, then they send everybody back. And what the religious Jews was
say, they were saying, "Here is a God" -- I mean "the hand of God. God saved the Jews."
And they all -- they all go and -- and we all Jews start praying, and God is the one. Jews,
you listen, and all that. The orthodox, and they were so happy. "You see, we still have a
God. God saved us." And I remember it like today they been saying. And they send us
back home. And this was the small ghetto was liquidated, but they had a bridge made.
The bridge to bring in the Jews from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, all the same
time from the large one to the small one, and started Selection Number'2. The big
selection, which was Octoberâ€™ 28th, 1941. That's when they had the big selection. And,
again, comes the case, I am with all my family, with my family and with Edna's family,
all together. That the way they had it, in groups. They want, they pick out -- every
groups they pick out a head an who is the talker, who can talk with the Germans, but not

everybody should go come and complain of say this and that. And I was selected by the
Germans that I should be the speaker for my group. In my group it was around 30 -- 30,
35 people. And he asked me my occupation. And I -- the power in me tells me I
shouldn't say a word that Iam a lawyer. I should only mention about my occupation.
What occupation I had when it's all I know is, all I learn, it's all my occupation? But the
power still tells me, don't say a word. And then he start hollering, "I asked you your
occupation." He hollers a little . Well, power tells me I should say I'm an auto
mechanic. And I say, "I am an automobile mechanic." And when I say "automobile
mechanic," he holler, "Right. All groups go to the right." They say this, "To the right
should leave, and the left die." And all the left people, the 5,000 that night, been killed,
every one of them. My uncles and I have lots family, and everybody been dead, killed.
The children, the cousins, raped and all. It was terrible. And that's it.

Q:So your whole family stayed?

A:They stayed.

Q:At that time?

A:Right.

Q:Now, in this big selection, where did it take place?

A:Vonugas (ph), a large country field. It was a big farm, a lot of farm, a lot of acres of land, and
there they brought us all up. It used to be the horse market and all kind of place, all kind
of business places.

Q. How did people get there? Were they told in advance what was happening?

A:They don't care. They say, "You got to be there

7:00 o'clock in the morning. How you get there is your headache." They say they don't have to

worry about it.

Q:So at that time everybody went?

A:Right.

Q:Nobody thought about staying home and hiding?

A:Right. Nobody was staying home as sick. They killed them right in bed. They did stayed
home, but they killed them. The Gestapo came in, the Germans in there, and killed them.
They also killed some of them they called got to be in . It was like a bath, they take
a bath. And they say, "Oh, you need a bath. Go in there." And they go in there, and
Gestapo kill them. That kind of problems they had. Well, this was the worsest. After
this is over, it got a little relaxed after they killed out over half and start all over. And it
still stays in front of my eyes. I can see the way they passed. I was right at the corner.
They going mostly by alphabet. The letter "I" was right in the middle. I could see my --
the rabbi from my temple, they bring the president from the temple, a lot of older people
mostly. They bring older, the old ones, they killed out. The young ones they still kept
because they need them.

Q:So you saw them actually leaving?

A:They going from the big ghetto to the small ghetto. The small ghetto was empty. And there in
the small ghetto it was not so easy -- in the beginning not so easy to get in. You had to

have ____â€”_â€”Â«, around number. You weren't no more after death. The selection, after that,
they didn't have no more when the person, whether he had Number 10, Number 50,
Number 57, Number 80, that kind. And since I register myself as automobile mechanic,
one morning, I assume it was the two days later, a German come running with Number
570. It was me. He said "Come report to the gate." The Jewish bodies had to deliver
right away. And they come right away running and told me I got to go to work at the
airport. Well, they took me. I had to go to work, because I'm a mechanic. Because there
I came, and they told me what to do. And I was also lucky. It's a luck. I'm standing with
the foreman on a truck, it was a German. A German army soldier come into the foreman
with a pickup truck. And he say he has trouble. The truck isn't running right. He talks to
the German, the foreman, can we help him. The foreman called me up, "Come here.
Talk with him and ask him what he wants." I go to him, ask what he wants. He tells me
he has trouble with his truck, it doesn't run. I've got do something about it. I said, "Well,
let me see." He start it up. I didn't hear nothing. I said, "Tell you what I'll do. I can to
lay down on the floor and you drive slow and over me, and I'll see what is knocking
there." I heard a knock. We hear it. He say okay. And he say when will I be able to
have ready. I say a couple days. He say, "Oh, no. Can you do it earlier? I'll give you a
good loaf of bread. I mean, you can do it? I have a farm not far from here, and I want to
run up to see what's going on home." "I'll do my best," I tell him. And Ido. And I lay
down, and I seen a big pipe with the universal joint with the drive shaft is loose, and I use
my head. I say, "What I am doing -- I moved it. It wasn't the newer kind of car; it was
the old late model Ford. And I took it out with my hand. It was loose. And I go into the
German, and I tell them I need a universal joint, and they bring me the part in stock. And
he sa, "Look, I can't understand. Tell me, how do you took off a drive shaft with -- so
long with so little bolts with a big tools. I gave you a screwdriver with a pipe wrench. I
told him, I say -- you see, you all the time you gotto bein your. And I told him,
"Well, I had it here, it was so loose, the pipe, that I didn't have to have any wrenches.

With my fingers I took it off and it got loose," and that's what I wanted. "Oh, I can
understand now." He understood. He gave me the parts, and I became the best mechanic
in the Gestapo.

Q:I need to take you back cause I have a few more questions about that big action.

A:Uh-huh.

Q:Did -- you had a Jewish government in place and you had Jewish police in the ghetto. What
was their involvement in these actions?

A:The Jews?

Q:The Jew -- the Judenrought (ph). Those people and the people on the Jewish police force, did
they have any involvement in this action?

A:Not.

Q:Did they help? Did they try to help Jewish people? Did they help the Germans?

A:I don't think -- I don't think it was in -- it was rumors was coming around that the Jewish
police knew where children hiding places were, and they reported it to the Gestapo, and
-- because to save their own skin that there, that's all they had. They didn't want to get
involved or something. They just point the place where you can see Jewish kids been
laying in hiding and been killed. That's the kind of rumors I had -- I heard, but I don't
know. I cannot verify, I can't say nothing because I don't know.

Q:Were they present at the selection, the leaders of the Jewish Council? Were they present?

A:Before. The leaders of the council, there wasn't too many. The only one was Tory, and it was
Dr.â€˜Elkes, and Tory had a secretary woman. It's all it was. That was the council. And
one was by the door, the Isaac, who didn't let me in to ask him find out what's going on.
About five, six people.

Q:So were they there at the time of the big action?

A:Yeah, yes.

Q:What were they doing?

A:Nothing. They didn't done nothing. They -- they didn't bother the police. The police saying
at first they had to have a working permit, and to get a working permit was hard. It
wasn't so easy. They been paying -- buying working permits, because they been told the
person with a working permit his life is secured. They don't go do nothing to them; he'll
survive. And they been giving us a working permit Number 537, and 537 is Israel Ipson.
And it was been already 537 in the , in that department. They been making it for --
in a minute for you. They had the special printing material and they be printing up 537.
They made 721 and they made -- and it the way it went. They had it made. And then
everybody was trying to go to the police because the city police don't bother. They have
enough troubles the way the average person has it. But nobody can go into the police.
They didn't took it. They want me. Why they want me? First thing, I was born there in
that place, raised in the place. I knew every little corner, every little hole. They need me,
but I say, "No, huh-uh. You don't go get me. I don't want it. I'd rather go to the airport."
But then, that's my help me too, by not going into the airport. Some of them say, "Well,

we cannot keep Ipson so long. He been so many years already here. We got to give him
a better job. It's not fair. We got to recruit all the work on his shoulder. We got more
Jews got to go to the airport. We swap it." Well, but that when I decided on to my uncle.

Q:Okay. We still -- I have a lot more questions about the ghetto.

A:Sure. Go ahead.

Q:All right. So do you -- is there anything more that you can tell me about these horrible
actions, the -- what happened with the small ghetto or what happened with the big action
at the end of October? Is there anything else? Could you see the people as they were
actually leaving, leaving the ghetto, walking out towards the forts? Was that -- could you
see that happening?

A:A walk inthe__, no. _I didn't see it happening. It would be very, very rough. And that's
funny. The Germans -- at the end of the Germans taking, there was a member by the
name of Lipzer. Lipzer was a head -- a right man for the Gestapo. It was a Jewish
person. I -- he became -- he was a nothing. He was a television salesman before the war.
I knew him personally very well. And he became a big shot because he wanted -- he
want to go -- when someone been locked up by the Gestapo and going to Lipzer, Lipzer
used to bring him out. How he been doing it, nobody knows. Had he been paid off, I
don't know. Used to save you something to the Gestapo, to Miller, for him for his wife a
present, and take it out and _ three. But it was the main thing. In my case, I felt a little
better, but I didn't bother with him. I stayed away from him. | didn't want no part. Like
when they put in Edna in jail, and I don't know why she got involved with it with her
mother. _ ot in jail my sister, and they put him in jail by the ghetto. It's a time -- and I
had arranged to take him out from ghetto to run with him to keep the place where to

work, but it didn't worked out. I got another very, very, __ terrible what happened.
The worsest part of what happened with me in ghetto. I even don't want to talk about it.
I had a cousin who worked for me. He's a very smooth operator by the gate. He wasn't
afraid for nothing. He had been supplying to the ghetto population anything they want.
A young kid. He was around 19 or 18. And he helped me to go to the gate with Jay,
because his house was also by the gate. And he helped me also to get to my farmer
whom my uncle sent to pick me up with Edna, because they want to bring me home. And
I see one day my -- it was a couple months later, my cousin is in my hiding place. He
came. How he came, I find out; but where he get the idea, I didn't know. I didn't want to
have nothing to do with him. Everything when he done for me, I paid him. I just didn't --
wasn't in me to have to do it, all this smoke-miray (ph), they call it. But this time he
come to me and ask me, "I need a favor." He wants a favor from me. I say, "What do
you want? I paid you for my favor to take me to the gate." "Yeah, you pay me. I don't
want that." I say, "When you want somebody" -- he say he want to bring his brother also
in my place where I am staying. I'll agree with that provided you can bring my mother
with the sister, with the older sister. You can bring them from ghetto to me, I'll do
anything you want." He say "Okay." I say, "But you remember, you got to bring my
mother," and I repeat him three times. And I say, "Marches" -- who is the gentile who
come to pick us up. I say, "Look, Marches, you see he should take my mother and
sister." "I don't know who they are." I say, "You'll find out." He didn't. He come on
board his other brother with his wife, bring her to me. And I come to the ghetto and I
say, "Who are -- what you brought them for? Who the woman?" "This is my wife," he
say. "But who give you the permission to bring them in here? I didn't ask you to come."
It was the best hiding place. It was mine. Why? It was in a safe. The Gestapo wouldn't
dream to fnd somebody. A gentile should work so much to bring people out of ghetto,
but he done it. Well, I got hot. I said, "Now, look. I don't want no more part of you. I
told you a bunch. I don't want -- I want my family. I didn't have nothing do with

strangers. Your wife, fine. I don't have nothing. I'm not married to your wife." Didn't
listen again. And he come with his less brother and his wife. And something got him
when they came to a little town they had to go through to come to me. It was Zezmer,
Zezmer. And go in three soldiers. And that to them comes a wagon, and the wagon was
my aunt -- the boy's mother -- and his wife. Four already been with him; two more came.
And I'm seeing the soldiers, and they were thinking that the soldiers go enough that they
want to arrest him. And they start running, about -- my aunt and my cousin, and the
soldiers didn't know what's happening. There were a big pile of hay. It was the fall of
the year. And they got in the pile of hay, they were hiding in the hay, and the soldiers
then come around, took him out of the hay, and shot him. Killed him. Took him not the
same day, next day. Mother and son, pardon me. Took him. I can't forget. This is
almost a fault of mine, when I would insist -- maybe they would be more easier, but I
insist to bring my mother. I wanted _ to have somebody. Many, many nights I don't
sleep because of that -- because of that.

Q:Now, I want to go back to the ghetto a little bit.

A:Okay.

Q:ls that okay?

A:Okay.

Q:What -- you said that, you know, you worked in the airport outside of the ghetto. Was there --
were there also workers inside the ghetto?

A:Yes. They had another. There was a very interesting things outside of the ghetto inside of the
ghetto. It happened I had to go and bring the beer for the German soldiers, but since my
father worked in the brewery, my grandfather worked in the brewery, they had the
connections. They knew each other, even in the ghetto. There was the workers who
worked with my father, came to him and it's what I -- it's terrible. And he had only one
suit. He had a suit on himself. One worker from the brewery, a gentile, he want he
should come to him and say, "Braetka (ph)" -- they call my father his name Braetka --
"how's about selling me your suit?" He say, "Well, I'll sell you my suit. I'll buy me some
cheaper suit. I don't need" -- it was a cloth (ph) suit. "Okay. What how much you want
to pay me?" He say, "I don't know." He say, "Okay. Tell you what you'll do. I'll buy it
for you. I'll give you the suit, and you'll pay me for it." "Okay. What do you want?" He
say, "I want that loaf of bread with a half a pound butter for the kids." "All right." He
comes in, he gives him a packet, and he goes away. And what they gave him? A brick.
A paper wrapped around a piece of brick, and took away the suit. And it was worker
worked with him all his life. He could fix him, and I told him, I say, "Don't bother. I'll
buy you another suit in ghetto, and don't bother with him. Have nothing do with him."
That kind of people he been working with.

Q:What was the -- was there an advantage to working outside of the ghetto instead of inside the
ghetto? Which was the better job?

A:Better -- naturally, it's better in the ghetto providing you have something to support yourself.
Inside of the ghetto was the main thing, the malin (ph) what they call it, the working
groups. Vachstaten (ph). The work places. There was around 5,000 Jews working,
because the Germans needed them very bad. They needed them to make loafs and to
make ears. And they used to catch -- bring cats and dogs and killing them, and taking the
ear covers and making ear covers from their skins. And they were bringing them in the

places where they have been hauling the cats and dogs was in synagogues, bringing them
full synagogues dogs and killing them. And there was already sitting sewing machines,
making ear covers for their ears from the dogs. And one day I come to work -- I come to
work with my cousin. I was the head of the brigade coming into the airport. A German
come to us, and he tell me, he say, "Look, I want you to take me to the ghetto." I say,
"What do you mean you want me to take you to the ghetto? I have nothing to do with it.
Leave me alone. Stay away." Next time he say, "You got to help me. I can't get any
beer. I'm short of bottles." And the Germans couldn't get any beer when they didn't have
empty bottles. "Well, I'll arrange that," I said, since I knew the people who knew my
father. And I told him, I said, "I need bottles," and they arranged it to give me three, four
cases empty bottles, but for my boss tohave beer___â€”_â€”.-~- And one day, I seen the
Gestapo man come looking for me. I got scared to death. I say, "Oh, this is the end.
This time I no get out." And who it was? It's funny. The brewmeister from the brewery
who it was before the war, who worked together with my father before the war, and now
he became a big Gestapo man. One of the big, big ones. And he was trying to find out
his boss. He want to see the Wolf brothers. The Wolf brothers, the six brothers, who
helped build the brewery, and Ingleman, they was still -- two were still alive. The rest of
them were dead already. And he came to bring a package, the Gestapo man, that I should
take over a package to one of his bosses. And he was a philanthropic man, a nice man.
And I took over a package, put it in ghetto, and I save it. And if they going to catch me, I
told them I got -- he give me his card. He say, "Don't worry. When they going to catch

they'll see in this card and know it was____â€”.Â£"" And then Mr. Wolf came. He came
through friends of my father. I told him, I say, "Look, help me. Have your son bring me
a package I got from Wolf, a package for me." And I had to deliver packages. The
Gestapo man used to bring packages for the Wolfs until the big selection. That's when
they killed him.

Q:You were saying that it was better to work inside the ghetto?

A:Yes.

Q:Why is that?

A:You didn't have to put up with guys -- at the gates with the guard, with the police. with
butter, with water, you had nothing to do with them. When you worked inside the
ghetto, you go from your ghetto place to your home or from home to the ghetto place.
And for that -- the only thing when you had a sewing machine or another -- toaster,
helped to trade it in by the gentiles. Items like that, they used to grab it and give you a
good price, and they had money to buy it. I had from one of my competitors when I
wandered out of one of the buildings it was, a cigarette box mixed from gold. Asked me
to trade it in for food. It was from Mr.â€˜Frumpkin (ph). And I'll take it. I'll try to do it,
but I took it but I wasn't capable to make a deal and I brought it back. He didn't -- if they
would have caught, they would have caught me, not him. It's not interested. It's not
involved in it. I was the one involved by tooking the transaction. My life was in danger,
but not theirs. And --

Q:Well, but now, isn't it possible that if you worked outside the ghetto you had more of an
opportunity to do business or to get extra food or that kind of thing?

A:Yes. They right, they live. But I don't know that life is worth it so much to do it. Well,
mostly Edna she was more for that. I didn't go for that. Didn't want to risk her life. I
had been looking for her twice. And now when I run away from the ghetto, I run no
more from the ghetto, but I had a new working place already. They gave me rifemeister

(ph). What I really been doing, taking old guns, rifles, cleaning it, fixing it up, oiling it,
and putting back in stock.

Q:Is that outside or inside the ghetto?

A:That was inside. They took a few people. They didn't took anybody. They were afraid. For
me they weren't afraid. They say when I'd say it wouldn't happen, it wouldn't do -- I
wouldn't done it.

Q:Could -- how did people get chosen for certain job assignments?

A:How did they get what?

Q:How did people get chosen for certain job assignments?

A:Had to have pull. You know what pull, what I mean? "P," protection. Without protection you
didn't get nothing. It just even don't dream about it. To get it, you wouldn't. But it was
Avraham Tory. You had to have him when you need to get a good job. It was Dr. Geslin
(ph), you had to have him to get a good job. He was the labor department chief. He
couldn't get without him a good job. I couldn't get a good job. I didn't get it. My
brother-in-law was a no-good. It was every little thing he wants to be paid with money. I
wasn't for that. But I didn't spoke to him again, and . People had to have him to
get -- to be able to get a job.

Q:So the administration in the ghetto was --

A:Wasn't too hot. Wasn't too hot. The reputation of theirs and the name was terrible. They
were drunks. They used to go out five, six, big shots -- I wouldn't call them -- going out
in the city, encounters, looking around to get something for nothing.

Q:They weren't that helpful to the population?

A:No, no. Nothing. They weren't helpful. They would help -- trying to help themself. But in
the end, the Germans killed them.

Q:What about Tory? Was he -- was he helpful? Was he a good man?

A:I don't know. I cannot tell you. I don't want to that he should get angry and maybe sometimes
he run into me and say, "What you done to me?" Well, I don't get along with him. He
right here, because I met him a couple of times in Israel. I've been many times there.

And I've been meeting him -- and, well, I don't know.

Q:They were all a little bit --

A:Yeah. He didn't done any harm to me, but the book of his he been writing, it had all of it been
translated, because he was a smart cookie. You know, I'd say one thing. Well, it's not the
Lithuanians. You didn't know that Professor Belodski (ph) -- you heard of him?
Professor Belodski was a professor of the University of Lithuania, a professor for civil
law. Professor Belodski -- Tory worked for him, a secretary. And Professor Belodski
lost his mind in ghetto, and they put him in a little home, locked him up, and left him.
And he looked like a little dog would be locked up. And I pass by and I seen it. I pass by
in the ghetto in that corner, that moment I was -- it was terrible. And I told Tory. I say,
"Couldn't you be -- so big shots, couldn't you help that man?" He could help. "Why
don't you do? Why haven't you done it?" He didn't say nothing. When you need him,

you need him, and . But he helped some of them, too. Without his help, what
would good would he be? But why would he had to protect the Soviets or blue-mortgage
(ph) or all those people without having benefit of mind to. He had a second wife. His
first wife, he was married to a girl whom he knew a lot of. The boys from high school, in
the fraternities, that I was along with them. We mingled together; we knew each other.
But some of them was nice and some of them was bad. Some of them paid for it after the
liberation.

Q:What about Dr.â€˜Elkes? Was he a good man?

A:Yeah. Oh, a terrific man. He already write a book. You didn't read it, did you?

Q:Well, tell me about him.

A:Well, I don't know. He wrote a letter, Dr.â€™ Elkes, to his children. He got a boy and a girl. And
he told them the direction of life, how they should behave, how they should live. In
Tory's book is it, and it breaks your heart. And one paragraph is worth -- oh, what he had
it in that book. But I'll have to get my book. I got him in English. In Hebrew he
translated, because Israel couldn't use a book. It wasn't good for him. And I'll have to
find out from my cousin.

Q:But he was a good man?

A:Yeah, he was a good man. He wasn't --

Q:And he tried to help the people?

A:He tried -- he could help more, but he helped. And I told him that, too. I say -- we met one
time and we talk. He helped. He didn't done nothing wrong. He could do maybe more,
but he done as much as he could with what's the name, with Gestapo man Miller.

Tape 3

Q:You were talking about the fact that the Jewish government, the police, the Judenrat (ph),
really weren't that helpful.

A:No.

Q:Why -- why do you think it is that they seem to have a better reputation than in most ghettos?

A:Because the people around those ghettos, and the people around the ages from the ghettos was
mentioned, they tried to help. Here was Robovski (ph). Robovski was a young, good
Jew, who worked at the gate all day long for three years. And he done so much good by
helping poor people get through -- he knew like a sewing machine going out. In going
out I saw him, I seen him from the ghetto to sell it some bread, butter. Robovski knew
about it because the men who got to take it out used to talk to Robovski to see -- to get it
German to tumult (ph) you know, that he should know what he's doing, take him away on
the side at that moment that we were seen. I carried one sewing machine, and it is a job
to get it out. I think Edna or else somebody sold it, a machine, and I had to carry it out.
It was my height, and we put it on the front legs right in here and the rear legs in the
back, and you walk with a sewing machine. Well, but there you had to have help. On
sometimes a person like that get caught, and then he's in trouble and somebody got to
help him to get him out. But some of them got feeling and some of them not. Some of
them say, "Oh, he got it for money." He not got it for money; got it for food, for hunger.
It all depend on the person, too. I don't know. That's why I build myself up a reputation
in the beginning. They begged me I should join the police. I say, "Not me. I would
never do it. I can't do it. How can I be a policeman when I with the boy who was from

Vensico (ph)" -- Robovski -- "been going to school, been to Hayda together. How could
I see that he's getting harmed and I stand by and not doing nothing. Huh-uh. That's not --
wrong man." I didn't.

Q:How did people get food in the ghetto?

A:Oh, this is no -- there was plenty. It was stole. It was one of my cousin, probably around 19,
oh, you order to him a cow, he bring you a cow. You order to him flowers or anything
you want. You could get anything. The best liquor you could get. People had money to
buy cognac. They buy and drinking cognac. And here is people working to death to get
it going, and they having a good time. But controlled that stuff.

Q:In the ghetto?

A:In the ghetto.

Q:But the Germans didn't know about this?

A:No, huh-uh. That was Atakata Pramovich (ph), famous lawyer. And he got with -- he became
one of the -- got in oven.

Q:Now what about the people who didn't have the money to buy the food or the liquor?

A:They had to eat kraut, cabbage with horse meat. You see, horse meat you had plenty. That's
what the Germans been sending to the Jews, horse meat and cabbage. That's all they
been getting. They didn't -- nobody could help, and they had no choice.

Q:But your sense is people didn't go hungry?

A:No, they didn't go hungry, because it's not the Lithuanian's element on the job. It's not the
element like the Lithuanian Jews. It is a person entirely another, made from another
dough. Right. Even right now, you take -- when you go in any business, you go with the
Lithuanian Jew, you have no worry. It's perfect. But you go with the Polish Jew, he in
troubles, because it's a element of theirs is different. Before they started, I could cheat
you.

Q:What else was going on in the ghetto? Was there any semblance of a normal life? Were there
activities? Were there schools?

A:Yeah, there was activities, for sure. There was a schools. There was a Zionist organization
working. There was the communist organization working in the ghetto. It was all kind of
activities working. But --

Q:Did you get involved in any of that?

A:Not, no, huh-uh.

Q:What about culture?

A:Some, not much. Yeah, it was after the liberation I got involved; but migration, this I was
very much involved.

A:No, no. This is all stopped. I don't know, maybe in other ghettos. Maybe some other ghetto,
but in Kovno ghetto nothing, no more. Only was the partisans worked hard, worked
good, and they wouldn't killed Hyme Yearling (ph). You heard about Hyme Yearling?

Q:A little.

A:A little. And they wouldn't kill him in the ghetto, what survive. And I'm a personal friend to
his brother, May Yearling. He's now in -- Yearling is in Israel. And I went with May
Yearling in high school. We graduated the same year. And I knew Hyme Yearling, too.
Then I didn't knew that Hyme Yearling was so capable and so brave. He killed himself
with a razor blade. He run out of ammunition. He couldn't fight. Took a razor blade, cut
his veins. And Kovno there is a place Cochen (ph). Cochen's a building, and there was a
fight going on in that building.

Q:Well, what else can you tell me about the ghetto life? Did you continue to celebrate Jewish
holidays? Was there any --

A:No. You know, you going out from ghetto. Here I went out from ghetto with what? With
nothing. I lost a mother, a father, two sisters. It was me. And I was thinking, here
Thad an opportunity. Maybe I had the opportunity to save them, and people cheated me
of my family, and I don't think I can never forget. I didn't know -- I didn't know -- I got
now a woman who what is my cousin's wife who lives in Florida, and she's got
everything she wanted, but she took away my sister's place. And I tell her it straight in

her face. I say, "If not you, my sister would be alive." Or maybe not. Maybe not, but
right the way it stays, I didn't have no choice. Well --

Q:Is there anything else you can tell me about the daily life in the ghetto?

A: Well, I don't know the -- there was something, the music, you know, the Gestapo, the Himmler
group, they liked music. And the Kovno ghetto had musicians in the ghetto, the stupors
(ph), and the windmill (ph). And all the musicians they had to once a week come in the
building from the seminary -- Was a large building. That building hold about 1500
people -- and play music for the ghetto people. It's the way they got it in their head.
They had to go. Who the heck was thinking with music? But they had to go. They
forced you to go.

Q:Did ORT (ph) go into the ghetto?

A:ORT, no.

here, and he spoke. And he knew Edna from the ghetto time and before the ghetto. And
he likes her cooking. Yakovaleski is a country (ph) within. He's dead. Nice man.
Lovely man.

Q:How much information at the time did you have about what was going on with the war and
what was going on with the concentration camps?

A:I knew everything what it was on the radio. I used to jump out at night when I worked the
night brigade, or even in daytime. I worked -- the brigade was rifemeister, they're called.
And there was a group of around 30 people with two woman. The woman used to
prepare a kitchen for us to eat. The captain was a nice man. He was a vermacht (ph)
person from the army, and he was in charge of our group of the rifemeistery. And he see
to it that we should be fed right, we should be treated right. He was a nice man.
Something he was from the German soldier, not bad. And he used to go to eat in the city.
Slobodka is a suburb, but to go to have a good meal for the Gestapo was they got to go to
his headquarters to --

Q:Kovno.

A:To Kovno. And the captain used to go away for two hours, and there'd be no way to figure
and no one knew how long he was gone and all that. And I used to go in in the office and
the captain turn on the shortwave radio. Everybody watching me, what's on the news.
Everything I knew what's was going on. To England, mostly. The piece of Canterbury is
there a big religious man. He been appealing to the Pope, and we asking the Pope to help
the Jews, they killing all the Jews. And the Pope didn't care. He didn't -- now John is
different, because he is more associated with the Polish Jews. It was his friends. But the

Q:Let me -- well, let's stop for a minute. Let's just try to finish up on this ghetto chapter --

A:Uh-huh.

Q:-- and sort of how you felt day to day while you were living in the ghetto. You went to work.
Your family all went in different directions in the daytime. Was there a fear during the
day that you might be hurt or that when you came home from work something might be
wrong with your family?

A:Right. Oh, this was all the time. We were afraid maybe one of the family wouldn't come
back. And go in the morning to work, we didn't know you'll be back. Maybe not.

Maybe you'll be reported by somebody. Maybe somebody will be hot and go to the
Gestapo and say, "Hey, take a look. He messed it up." It's good -- it's enough to get
killed -- here___â€”.-: Every day Hitler used to send burgess (ph) with all metal pieces,
filling it up, bringing in cement for they need it for the airport for the runways. And
taking our back steel -- old cars, old tanks, all that, bringing it back. And who had to
unload? Me, as they elected. I was a mechanic and top quality mechanic already, they
send me there to help unload the cement and help to load up the steel. And it was a tough
job, because it was raining and I didn't have any shoes. I had a cut-up tire, with a knife to
cut it up on, and tied it up around with wires that I shouldn't slip. And here I'm going
with a metal on my shoulder and bring it in to the bars to drop it in that it should be filled
up. I don't know how many tongues they had to have. And when I'm going with the
wornout tires sole, I slipped. And when I slipped, and I had still a piece of metal on my
shoulder, I dropped the metal and I start falling. And I grab myself on the wood and the
board, but it was going like a little bridge from top down to this piece of metal. And I
pulled myself up not to fall in. Would I fall in, I don't know how I would got out. Maybe

I would be dead, because of this old broken up steel for the rest of the other boys been
dropping it in. And the Germans seen it. He come running to me, without even saying
nothing, and start beating me with a stick. Right here on my shoulder. And I -- I couldn't
forget. I told the German, "You shut up. You better stop. I'll break your neck." And I
knew the German will react right away. I ama nothing. I am a dog in that time. And he
pulled out a pistol and start laying into me. And the boys who knows me, I walked with
me together in the same spot, told me, "Ipson, run, run. He going to kill you. Take a
look. He's got to pull the gun. You better go." And all of a sudden I hear shimm,
shimm, shimm, shimm. And also I been saved. I don't know how I got saved. I been
running right behind the old cars, the old trucks, and he lost his aim right. But in the
beginning he as going to kill me in a minute. And here is a case here I went to work, I
wouldn't even dreamed about it was going to happen, and get killed. It's what's
happening in the life every day, every hour, every minute.

Q:Did you teach your son -- he was a -- was your daughter still alive at this point? Your little
girl, was she still with you?

A:Yeah. No, she wasn't there. She was dead already.

Q:Before -- how did she die?

A:We didn't -- she died from poison, poisoned milk. That's what the doctor said. The doctor.
Who knows? Edna says she needs for the girl milk. She was young; she was three
months. And I went to the farmer asking for milk, and she gave me the milk. And she
told me to be careful. She say, "The milk is maybe sour," but she didn't -- she didn't want
I -- to spill out. She want to give some of the Jews a piece and buy one to drink for the
child. And that way I got her the milk, and she died a month later.

Q:This was at the very beginning of the ghetto?

A:Right. Very beginning. It was after the pogroms. I went to the number two highway, not the
number one. The number one highway a lot of Jews been coming back and they been --
got stopped and killed. They be killed by the Lithuanians.

Q:So was your daughter, did she go into the ghetto with you or this was all before?

A:Before.

Q:Okay. So you had your son. Did you teach him how to protect himself in the ghetto? How to
hide or anything?

A:Right. We had to.

Q:What did you teach him?

A:I would teach him to be quiet, not to say a word, nothing. When he's in the dark, be careful,
look around every step, the good light. And he should be careful to move around
from one ghetto to small ghetto. When we are escaped, why I had to have him a place
where to keep him. Gentiles wouldn't take him, and I didn't want nobody should know
too much about it. And I had to take him over from the big ghetto to the small one.
Where I took him over to the small ghetto and told him, I said be quiet. He shouldn't say
a word until -- wait until we come back and we'll bring him. And here is a kid like five
months -- no, no, not five months. Five -- five weeks.

Q:Five years.

A:Right. No, I been laying -- he was laying, not move. And he had a German soldier, guard,
and going around with his boot. And he was close to him, and he say, "Oh," and I train
him.

Q:It must have been difficult to have a such a young child at that time.

A:I didn't have no choice. When you have no choice, you be surprised at what you do. You do
anything when something bad is chasing you, pushing you, and telling you what to do.
You don't become no more that all-quiet person, don't say nothing and do nothing and
interested in nothing. You can't do it. It's another force forces you to do things which
you never thought done it in your normal life.

Q:But did you ever think of trying to get him to safety or to maybe to stay with some of the
Lithuanian people without you so that you could move about more freely?

A:No. I didn't trust the Lithuanians. Nothing. The Lithuanians was this worser than the
Germans. The Germans, when you speak a good German, you still could save yourself,
but not with the Lithuanians. Like I came in Berlin, I run from the Russians. I run from
them, too. I run from the Germans. I run from the Russians. I got to run -- keep running.
I come in Berlin and --

Q:This is -- let's wait for that; okay?

Q: Were you aware of any underground or resistance activity inside the ghetto?

A:Oh, yeah.

Q:How did you know about it?

A:I know May Yearling, boyfriend of mine, and he used to come once in a while, get together,
he and his wife, and we been talking. And his brother was Hyme, Hyme Yearling, and
Hyme Yearling was tough. But I want now -- well, I don't know. One case I don't know.
I can't tell you. I don't know who sue some, and I don't want to get Meyer (ph) involved.
Meyer a good boy.

Q:Well, did you ever think of getting involved with them?

A:Oh, no, no. I send him every once in a while a check to help him. He sends me -- he writes a

And he writes about the ghetto. It's all he writes about, the ghetto life.

A:No. I didn't want to know. I didn't want to get involved, because they had problems with the
underground by the gate. The shootout was between the underground and Gestapo at the
gate of Florence (ph). Florence was a soap factory, and there was a corner covered by
Holmes Higher Buildings (ph). It was a hiding place there. And there they went out
from the ghetto. It was going already to the underground group to the woods. They been
already and checked it, and it was right by the factory of Florence. The truck
driver who had been taking them over took money from nothing, and he spilled the
beans. He told the Gestapo that the group Jews are running out from the ghetto, and they
been waiting already for them and they start shooting each other. Well, and everybody
survived, but they killed the sofa (ph) and got rid of the truck. But that man is buried in
the cemetery from Richmond. He came to me and I helped him. And he decide to settle
with what they done, with the lights laid out, and they caught them with their handgun by
the gate and Lipzer took him out.

Q:So toward the end of your stay in the ghetto, you had heard about children being taken away.
You decided you had to get out, and that's when you contacted your wife's uncle?

A:Right.

Q:Now, at that point, who was still living with you before you left the ghetto?

A:My father and mother and sisters. I had a brother-in-law, who I wish I would never had had.
He -- my sister was his wife, and he lost her. But he's been a big shot. He was a tough.
-fuhrer, they call it. And he was living with -- in ghetto, and he was thinking he's bigger
than anybody. And, you know, because of him I lost my sister, and --

Q:And your wife's family?

A:No. She lost everybody -- in five minutes, she lost them. They come and ask for Riga, who
was the I -- the selection for Riga. Riga, Jews for Rigaburg (ph). The reason was the
Germans weren't careful, and they stored all the Jews in Riga. Killed them all. Didn't
have any work force where they could get them for nothing. And then they had to get
people for -- new people for Riga. They took it from the ghetto of Kaunas and send it to
Riga, and there went my wife's family. There went her family.

Q:But they -- when they took your wife's family, how did that come about?

A:Oh, it___â€” for one right now. They truck away my father-in-law, Edna's stepfather, great
big hand. He must see me staying for the last time that he waved, and I stayed in front of
my eyes all the time. They appears by his house, as he was a very, nice, nice, nice man.
But he went to the ghetto from the first day to the last. And the police came -- I don't
know. Maybe it's my fault, too. I don't know. They need five people -- they need people
for Riga to come and get them. There were five. It was a father and mother, two
brothers, and a sister. It was five people. They come and ask for them. But she be
around -- I don't know where she was in that moment -- she wouldn't let him take it. And
she wasn't there, and she blame right now in five minutes I lost a family, and cries all, all
the time. Because it was very, very painful for her. And I still had my family, but I lost
them in the big selection. And that's quite in the big election. No, no, it was bad. There
was a brigade was Monkas Melina (ph). Monk. And that man had build himself a place
to hide that it was unbelievable. You couldn't find it anyway you want to look. And he
was in the ghetto. And my sister was with him in his melina. And when they tried --
after the war, I run right away I was there. August the 1st the communists took Kaunas.

I was the first -- in the evening, I was there. And I came with the trucks from the Russian

soldiers, find the Jews already, jumped with them in the truck, and came to Kaunas and
run right away through the ghetto. And I running into the ghetto and going from corner
to corner at the bottom looking. Nothing. It was so clean, and I never seen like it. I
couldn't find nothing. The only thing I seen Lithuanians, which was in Pavoretto (ph)
what were the pieces of a woman. Lithuanian woman with a long stick with a big metal
digging in the ground, trying to find somebody bodies, maybe. She could find others, be
able to get some stuff. It was unbelievable. And there the gentile who had lived next
door th cemetery seen me. I used to go and listen to the shortwave radio, what's going
on. And he told me he seen that there is too that there was Segersom (ph). No
Mendleson (ph). Mendleson was a man who was in the brigada with me, and in a year
after the war, and he run in in the place where we been working. He work with me there
in the brigade. And hiding himself, Mendleson. And one of our soldiers, this -- and the
German army was going back already all the way back to Tulsic (ph). And one of the
head like a Gestapo decided to go in there where it was working, the sergeant, and what's
his name wasn't too careful, and he seen Mendleson. He took his pistol and killed him in
the day of the liberation. And it was they killed Mendleson.

Q:Okay. Why don't you tell me a little bit about how you left the ghetto. How you and Jay and
Edna left the ghetto to go into hiding. You told me that you had made arrangements
through her uncle. Would you prefer to stop now?

A.lt's -- I would stop, yeah.

Q:Okay. So how is it that you got out of the ghetto to go into hiding?

A:Well, after we got out of the ghetto --

Q:How did you get out?

A:Well, how I got out to the ghetto, as I had to get at night to -- I cut the barbed wire with a pair
of pliers, opened up a big hole, and crawled through that hole. Across the street was
maybe by 200 feet was already houses. It was a small ghetto who was -- that was
liquidated. That is their houses where they lived, the people. And from there already a
farmer, my uncle send to us, was waiting outside of the territory was a hundred and --
close to a hundred miles. And there we got together again there. Jay, me, and Edna and
the farmer. And he put in Jay in the wagon, which was full of straw, covered him up, so
it shouldn't be nobody should see him. And I was walking with that wagon, because to
the danger places I didn't want to run and to make some noises, should be as quiet as
could be. I even asked the farmer to take the shoe of the horse, to put the shoe with
rubber pads we shouldn't hear him go around or do anything, we be quiet. The same is
what's very important for us, the German, they had these boots there with nails. You
could hear it for a mile. And that's the way we moved. I seen one stopped us with a
wagon, "Where are you going? What you got?" They got -- they thinking he the farmer.
"You got anything for sale?" "I don't have anything for sale," and they didn't bother.

Q:And your wife was walking, also?

A:She was walking as much as she can. We all walked -- walk as much as we can. We had a
wagon to take us in and go as fast and all we want, but we didn't walk that way. You
were so scared every little noise. A rabbit goes by, you jump, scared to death. Who is

that with that noise? And then we were successful. Thank God. My cousin when he
went to me, he went on a bicycle. It was a long, long worn out trip.

Q:How far did you have to travel?

A:60 -- about 75 miles.

Q:So now, did you go with this one farmer the whole time?

A:That farmer, the younger, he's brave, smart. He didn't fit in for a farmer. When I could bring
him here, I would have done anything for him, as good as he is. And they work, as I say,
everything fit together. I tell you, not like a farmer, but like a professor, you know,
everything right. He told us ahead of time -- when we came in the ghetto -- I mean out of
the ghetto, he brought us in in his house, and he didn't hear nothing. The poor farmer, his
house was a smokehouse -- what they call? A smokehouse. Like the smoking ham or it's
-- he had the oven without the chimney. And he get two little boys, very noisy, and for
the boys are more worried -- scared more for them than I was scared for the big ones.

But first place he told the boys they should put us on the top of the oven. The oven is
almost as big as half of that room, and it was nice and warm and comfortable, because it
was cold, ice and snow, and he put us right under there. And we were asleep, and it was
enjoyable sleep I ever had. But here comes in the farmer, and he start snooping. And he
say, "Wait a minute. Who is here?" He asked the children if he knew whom to ask. The
children they would tell him. The rest, we wouldn't tell him. "Who lives here? Who
moved in here recently," he asked the kids and asked the farmer's wife. They say -- his
wife ask him, "Why are you asking? What does that have to do with your business?"
"No, here is city folks moved in. I smell. The smell is a city smell. And somebody,
stranger, moved in. Who could move in?" He started figuring the people telling to the

room and whom you think could be? "It must be city lawyer. That's all. The lawyer
come here." And it was me. You see, "The lawyer with Itska (ph)", Itska was her uncle,
"they are the one moved up right here. They in that house," he tells the woman. Well,
she send the kids right away to come home, his___. And he came, and she told them
both the man's name or was here and what he said. He said, "We in trouble. We got to
get out immediately," the farmer said, "for mine house. And let's take them to his sister's
home." And that's what we did. And we going halfway, the sister, the bugs, the dogs
start barking, carrying on. He says, "It's no good. The farmer was going with us to the
people we were going. He told Edna, "We'll have to go to the Paskavitz (ph), to the
people Paskavitzes." And they the only one in this situation they could help -- can help
us, because the Gestapo wouldn't bother with them because their son-in-law the chief of
police of Volitus (ph), a city. A small city, not a big one. And they -- and he's very
tough, tough chief of police. And then they have to worry when people are find out,
they'll go everywhere until his house, until -- to that chief they don't want to start it.
Well, everyone in this time was not kosher. Everybody will be taking it to the table,
taking __, stealing, covering, all kind of mismatch of business was going on. But up
to the chief of police. And then the farmer told Edna, "When you can go in in the house
and tell the old lady who you are, then they'll do it. She'll do for you because of your
mother." And her mother was already dead. Then he told the boys to watch out, not to
go home, never go with him. The farmer took him around and let the boys go on around
because it would maybe be caught and can be messed up. He was smart. And then every
5 -- every 10 minutes, the farmer used to lay down on the ground with the ears, and knew
the movement from the Gestapo. The Gestapo was already looking for us. And when
they -- they knew exactly where the Gestapo were, because the noise, the walk, when
they been walking. It was wintertime and cold, and the snow was ice, and we go with
boots on ice it's makes a noise which you can hear far away. And every half hour we
used to lay down. We go into woods, and they say "Let's go. It's good. The dogs are

there," and they be giving us the plans on moving with us where the dogs are. The dogs
were making the noise because the new strange people came in. They think the strange
people they were after them. And it was not one, it was a bunch of police looking,
because I was the dangerous one. Dangerous than the partisans, because partisans was
living right there too in those woods, in the woods. It was thick woods and good____,
and it what the partisans need. They live in there. And it's the way we moved up to the
Paskavitzes. Edna knocks in the window, and "Who's there?" And Edna say --
mentioned her mother's name. "Don't know her." The old man comes up to the door,
opens it a crack, and say, "Who you?" And she tells him she is Esther's -- Esther's
daughter, and she want to talk with him. "Esther's daughter? Which Esther are you
talking about?" Say "Esther from Slobodka, from Lithuania, that is my mother. And I
am Hikki (ph)," they call it, yeah, "I am Hikki's daughter." "Oh, Hikki's daughter." They
know who it is. They let us in home, she and her husband. Her son, second son died.
They had a daughter and a son. The son did not investigated what goes on in the village,
because they knew each other. Every movement. Anything in a little village they knew.
Then he went out that night to report the mother and father what's happening in the
village. And they come back the next day and reported that the Gestapo was looking for
-- spent two hours checking, searching around the lake, although they had a round lake,
and couldn't find them. Couldn't find nobody. And they dissolve it. They decided to
move in another time. They didn't____â€”.- Two days they come again. And this time,
they were very close to us, closer here, but there was not time even to get if you were
laying right in the attic, laying the cover it up with all junk, with all hay and all that. But
we -- he didn't even let us stay there no more. The farmer's brother-in-law took us
from the attic. Edna and me and Jay, all three, out. He don't want even to have us close
by. He's afraid that when we get caught, he'll be shot by the Gestapo. And they let out
rumors more and more they were killing. It was true. They been -- the Germans around
there caught a lot of underground people in those woods. And the only thing -- the only

salvation people had, the Germans were scared to death for the woods. For woods they
were afraid, because they know with the underground is no place to play. They when
they do a job, they do it. They blew up five train loads with soldiers right in this section.
It was a very worthwhile section for the underground, that even Moscow had been
sending the partisans by plane in those sections. Well, and when we came to them, we
could stay only three weeks and we had to move out again. Had it rough. That moving is
terrible. Why we had to move? It was right before Christmas, and before Christmas all
the families had got together for the holidays, and the people were laying there in a big
bottom covered up in straw and hay, and we were afraid that the kids, that two small kids
were came also, that they'll start getting noisy, and going upinthe___ in daytime, they
can find us. Then Paskefski -- Paskofski, I got ahold of Edna's uncle, and told him, I
said, "Take us out of there. He's afraid to keep us." Because we could been -- all could
get in dangers. We had to move out again from this place and go looking for another
place. The only place we decide -- which I decided with Edna's uncle, it would be --
there was Paskavitzes was the first one, but this was Paskofski. This was two separate
families. Another one, Paskofski. Paskofski was a very, very, very poor farmer, a very
religious man. Nice man. And he done it anything for a reason. He didn't took from me
-- didn't even want to take from me. I offered him money. I had a few gold pieces. I
say, "Take it to him only at least one for memory for me." He took one. We used to sit
down outside at night. The only conversation with each other. At 1:00 o'clock at night,
and talking about the things, what's going on, what's happening in the world, with the
fight, what with all the traveling, with the predicting when can we be liberated. Here we
already have the war in Stalingrad. In Stalingrad with the Russians took the overhead,
and they been already stopped. The German army to go forward and start already
pushing them back. And I tell them the war. When we came then to Paskofski, we were
a little happier. Why poor -- and nobody was looking for a poor farmer. Everybody --
the partisans came, they look for a partisan with money. A partisan with good -- buy

ammunition. And where they would find the ammunition? Right by the farmers. The
farmers used to sell the ammunition. They used to come in, and -- the partisans, and to
the farmers, and have the names and have everything they already knew also their
investigation, through their investigation, what's happening. But Paskofski had two
potato peats. And a potato -- you know what a potato peat? Ninety percent of the people
don't know, never heard of it, they don't know what it is. But a potato peat, there we used
to lay. I was one cuple days in the barn sleeping there. I wasn't safe. I couldn't sleep. I
was scared all the time. Maybe somebody's coming in. And then I mostly staying right
there. And then Paskofski also have a German shepherd, a dog, smart like a -- called him
Vilgas (ph). I gave him a name Vilgas. Vilgas means wolf. And I been talking to him
and eating together from one plate, bring him up and hand the bones, for the farmer had
bones left over. Why, sometimes I went out with him to get soliciting help, soliciting
food from the farmers. I used to go with Edna's uncle. He knew everybody. He knew
where to go in and where to stay away from; which house there was a friend, and if there
was an enemy right there; to know where to go, to watch their step and not to go. That's
why we succeed, because Edna's uncle knew everything. Every step we do he say, "Don't
worry. Come back." We used to come in the morning, he say, "You go and do your job."
I say, "What's your job? He say, "Kill the lice." Ihate for-- ____ shower for months,
and they were covered up with all this stuff. But then the only thing early in the morning
a little sign of sun, a few rays came in, we stay in there and clean it up ourself that we
should be able to wear another day. And but then -- and the rest of them, the uncle, all
my cousins, we were 14 people in the two peats. And how I done the peats, one of them
were apart from the other, like from this wall until here, it was a tunnel. A tunnel that
used to be able to go in and out. To go to the tunnel, you had to -- on your belly,
particularly for kids, you had to crawl up to the exit. And it wasn't such a easy job
because we had five, three, five -- six kids, and they been for them it was there to play.
For Jay he was at that time five, he would crawl in there and crawl in here, who was

crawling faster. But I was scared to death that it could collapse. I didn't have any
support. I put in a few branches, but that's all. And I said the ground could -- the sand
could fell and killed the kids. And then I would be in trouble; they would be all over us
dead. It was rough. And Edna, when you say that Jay listen to me. He had to listen.
And I told them, every one of them, that I am the boss. That they should know not play
around, not to run around, because our lives depend on it. Finally the kids, after they
understood I was right, they already been controlling theirself. When somebody been
talking a little louder, the other kids would say, "You shut up. You keep quiet." And at
night we used to go out and get some bread. And then when in day, in daytime, well, the
woman got to go out after all, say person cannot be all the time, we have empty stomach.
And then we had to a fix up for that, too. A big bucket with all that outside and cover it
up with potatoes, rotten, rotten potatoes. I made it that way that the rotten potatoes was
high, and I'd been pulling with a string to opens it up a little opening, and all the rotten
potatoes fills up the hole that you couldn't see the entrance And people been coming.
First thing, the dog used to take care of a lot of things. Never did let nobody to come in
close by. I've been training him so that I didn't give him the bones unless he go and fix it
up, get himself a place -- I did a job. I had some fun. And it worked. I've been talking to
him like to a person, and he believes me. And I'm staying one evening, and I used to go
out to fix the peats. It was around 10:00 o'clock at time and all the farmers are asleep,
and I shouldn't get in any troubles by staying and digging. I wasn't careful enough, and it
collapse on me. The sand from the  peats got together in one spot and got wrapped to
here in sand. It was terrible. I couldn't move. The first time I understood what it means
being covered up with sand that is unable to move away nothing. I was staying in one
spot. I couldn't even move a hand. Nothing. I couldn't even breathe, getting harder and
harder to breathe. Vilgas was right with me. And I told Vilgas, "I'm in troubles. Go and
bring me Paskofski. Go and bring me Paskofski." And I showed him a bone, and it
cooked. And he come to get for a bone. I took the bone. "You go and bring him and

then I go give it to you." I been talking to him like I talk to a person. Anytime after I
have a lesson with a dog, the dog takes off. Where he goes, I don't know. I told him, I
said, "Go to the old man," the owner, the farmer. I said, "Wake him up." But he didn't.
What's happened, the farmer had a son, Stasook (ph). His name's Stacese (ph). That's he
used to go -- every weekend go in the farm places, the music with ghettos, and go in there
to dance and carry on. And passing by every time, automatically he used to pass by the
peat. See how the dog didn't bother him. He knew him very well. And the dog seen
Stasook Stacese coming up, and he jumped right on him and start pushing him. His paw
back, and should go front, and said go to the peat. And Stacese understood something in
trouble. "Who's in trouble? Tell me," he asked the dog. And the dog grabbed him from
his coat, the coat, the side, and pulled me up to the hole to the peats where I been laying,
and he dug me out. And I could move. I was a feeling like I got from dead to alive. It
was a terrific. And I got out. Then he say, "Well, they'll make a meal." "Okay. We
make a meal. I'll pay for it." We got a pig, and we had to smoke some for Jay. He loved
Jay, give him something to eat. And that's the way we got out for a while. Now, the war
came to Vilnius, and Vilnius from the place where the army, the Russian army was
around 75 miles. And a week later, I seen the oldier. The soldier going clear up without
a___, with holes, with all that. And Paskofski tell me, he say, "It's a Russian solder.
It's not aGerman. A German wouldn't go sloppy the way he's going." I say, "Wait a
minute." I look a minute. I say, "Yeah, it's a German -- I mean Russian." I holler in the
Russian language to him. He responds and come up to me. I ask him, "What you doing
here? The Germans will kill you." "No, they wouldn't kill me." I say "What do you
mean?" He say, "My army somewhere around here. They full now here around. Don't
worry. Nothing going to happen to you, too." He knew right away. I told him how I got
up there, and I sounded potato peats and all that stuff. And I say, "Now I got to find --
tell me, where is your captain? I want to talk to a captain, to anybody." He say, "Let me
first find him." I don't know about the Russian army. They go fight with the Germans

and they don't know one from each other. But finally they come up, and he was one of
the Jewish captain. And I told him who I am, how I come here, and what's is here, and
who's Paskofki. And to be sure, he asked me a certain prayer, a Jewish prayer. I said,
say, it's a song, it's -- the captain, Russian captain say, "I repeat it." I say, "All right. You
okay. Now I know you're not the enemy. I am not afraid for you. You're not do me any
harm." And he say, "Where are you going?" And I tell him I want to go -- the first thing
to go to the ghetto to see maybe somebody from my family is alive.

Q:Can I stop you here?

A:Uh-huh.

Q:I want to ask you some more questions about this time you were in hiding before you go back
to your ghetto.

A:All right.

Q:If you don't mind.

date approximately?

What we've been doing, at night about where I was going through, he knew the way, the
place there, the woods, going to farmers whom he knew, he knew very, very well. He
didn't have to be afraid for them. He go and knock on their door, on the window. And
they'll let him know by that knock that this is Itska, that is the farmer, Edna's uncle, and
let us in. And we've been buying from them. He be used to buy mostly a young calf and
killed it, cleaned it, and something to eat, smoke some, and use it for food, and that's
what we been eating. Bread, I used to say to the farmer, you know, you've never seen.

and make flour out of it. And then we put it right in the oven and make bread. We had

Q:And so you went out at night?

A:At night.

Q: Where was this oven? You mean in the farmer's house?

A:Yeah, farmer's house.

Q:So you had water and you had food and --

A:We had -- we had everything. We didn't -- about food was no problem. It was no problem
even in hiding, because -- but you got to be careful. You couldn't be reckless. I couldn't
stay there. The farmer was tired also not doing nothing. I was tired not doing nothing.
Then the farmer, I seen here now the same thing, got two long sticks. And I got one, he
got one, and we work hand in hand. It was very, very, interesting, and it's a good
exercise. He sworn over the coal. I was the one -- and then we cutting the wheat and

A:Sleep. And Edna and I couldn't do nothing. And it's enough hard work. My uncle will never
forget. He used to tell me, "You see, take a look at how bad people we are. The human
being is terrible. You take and you beat up a horse. You don't go fast enough or you
don't pull strong enough, and then you get whipped and kicked and all that. Move, move,

Tape 4

Q:You had mentioned that there were partisans in this same area, and I was wondering whether
you had contact with any of them. But before -- I just want to clarify, where was this
area exactly?

A:Zezmer. Zezmer. It is a little town. It was one street, people living in one street. And there it
was between Vilnius and Kaunas. And there is a lot of woods, and it's the only place we
had to pick, because the Germans was afraid for the woods. The woods is a trap for
them. They were scared to death. When they already were in the woods and you seen a
German group, even a battalion, could be 500, you don't have to worry about it. They
don't go fight. They scared. They look for another place for to run. And it's what
happened also with them. And we were -- every time we heard -- we heard a shot, we
were jumping for joy, because we seen here is Hitler getting beat and here we -- our time
to be free is so close that you just touch it. And he already seen the Russians plane right
over our head. You see that Paskofski had a lake, there's a lake on his land. And we
went there to swim and to lay in the sun. It was foolish of us, too. We could get shot. A
German plane could seen here we're having a good time laying in the sun, and here we
got to still fight a war. It they can shoot us.

Q:You did this while you were in hiding?

A:In hiding. It done like a fool, didn't know what to do. I just was worried. And I told Eejicka
(ph), I say, "Why are you in there?" He was heading there on teaching the children. You
see, he didn't had nothing to do, and the kids he want to get educated. He didn't have any
books. They didn't know the alphabet. Nothing. He only worked from the prayer book
it's what they had. He teach these boys how to read the alphabet. And what he done,

they been sitting under a little hole, and there was a ray to -- a ray from the sun coming
down, and it's a wide clear place, and there he was sitting with these two boys, and he
was teaching the bible. And I tell him, "I am going to take a swim." He say, "Don't need
a swim." Well, but I done it. I done to the lake. The next day I was smarter. I talk to
Paskofski, and I told him, "Would you make me a bath?" And he done. He laugh a little.
Isay,____. ~What he done, he took rocks he had, he put the rocks with wood, special
wood in with the rocks, which red hot from the heat, and there he been___ and giving
me -- we used to say a shoulder, a cold shoulder make warm. And it was just the best,
best moment in my life. Many people ask me what I felt and what I want and what I used
to at that moment. I say the hottest and enjoyable and best thing that happened to me is
getting the bath by Paskofski. It give me -- it was terrific. And then one day, I am sitting
there. I am walking in my office, and I take a look at farmer's wife crying, carrying on. I
say, "What's the matter, Mrs. Paskofski?" She say they locked up her husband. I say,
"Who locked up?" She say, "The Russian commander. They locked him up. They say
he don't want to go in the army." I say, "Tell him he's crazy." Paskofski was a man
already in the 70s, don't want to go in the army. I say, "Let's go. We'll take him out.
Don't worry. Don't cry. I'll get him back." I took and I had a jeep, put her in the jeep,
and I went back to the place where we were in hiding. And I got in Zezmer, in one of the
places between Vilnius. And I told them, I say -- I tell them who I am, and I came in here
to get Paskofski out. I say, "Why are you taking and arresting a man who is already 70,
time already to die, and you lock him up because they find out a hiding place?" The man
say that -- that captain, I don't know what, the major. He say, "Well, you know what he
done?" I say, "He didn't done nothing." He say, "What do you mean done nothing? He
took a bunch of drunks," and he say, "put them in a hole that they shouldn't go. They had
to go register for the army. They didn't went to register for the army; they went to drink
right there in the peats where -- what you build. And the first thing I don't know is you
done it." I say, "Why are you doing?" I say, "Ask my question. How it looks and what

you want to know. I ain't going to let you know from the peat, if the peat is right or is a
wrong peat." Well, and this gave me -- I say, "All right. Tell me what if -- what is in that
place and what is that place." I had to make a plan, and hey let him out. And then I got
Paskofski out. I say, "Don't go out. I'll take you back." And it's 50 miles almost. I took
him back. And anyway, I got Paskofski. Now Stasook, his son, he's the one that start the
troubles. He told the neighbors that is the refugees running and hiding in here. They
been there and they messed it up and he get blamed. But they took him in the army.

Q: Well, I was asking you if when you were in hiding before the liberation you had contact with
any of the partisans in the area. Did you ever run across them?

A:Yeah, run across them, but it wasn't much. They -- they -- in that area, they used to come
regular routine to get food. And they been telling -- find out there's a rich farmer, he got
lot of meat, a lot of butter and all that stuff, they been asking. They told him they go pay
when you want to go pay, but you got to have food to eat and they got a lot of children,
and it was a lot of groups, big groups. And then the farmer wasn't so anxious to give, and
he told him a couple times, I say, "They don't want any monkey business. They want
food. They're not -- they'll take it alone. When they'll take, they'll take everything that
goes." And they settled and they gave them food to eat. And it wasn't such terrible. But
they were ready to fight with what killed a lot of them. The -- not the Lithuanians -- not
the Germans, but the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians say, "Woods doesn't mean nothing,
because they live in the woods. The Germans didn't go. And the men -- there was five
explosions that let the railroad go, breaking the rail and been blown up.

Q:So this was all going on around you?

A:Yeah.

Q:Did it give you hope? Was it encouraging?

A:Yeah, that give me hope. I was encouraged already before, because the shooting was going
around already so close, but beyond there, what -- what's happened? The Germans had
that partof____â€”_â€”s occupied, and they been there having all kind of whiskey. Was a
distillery from vodka, and they big drunkards. And when they came to that place, the
Russians, they start drinking, and been drinking for three days, and got so drunk they
were laying like dead. And they didn't know what was going on at that time. The
Germans come back and they really give them some blows and they lost a lot of soldiers,
the Russians. And this messed up -- messed up the ghetto, because they were so close to
get to Kovno. Everybody was so anxious. And Golub also, Tory, talk with the Miller
from the Gestapo, and beg them and offer them a big amount of money, and told him to
help see that his life will be protected, that nobody will touch them. But Miller didn't go.
Didn't took it.

Q:Okay. Let's -- now we can -- unless you have more to say about the hiding period.

A:No, it's most of the hiding period.

Q:Did you pray a lot or no?

A:I didn't have from what to pray. I didn't have no books. I prayed. I did pray.

A:Right. It was a nice, young man. He reminds me of what is it? Christ. Tall, nice looking
young man was with me in the working spot right by the place where the German army
been moving out from Lithuania already back to Germany. The army all been pulling. It
was a nice size, not too big, but it was a nice size. And they pass by this part where we
worked with the young man, his name was Settleson (ph), and myself. We were there
around 30 people. Our work was to rifemeister. Rifemeister. I'd been a place of fixing
ammunition.

Q:Yeah.

A:And we been staying and cleaning them. And he knew the place. And the boy -- and when he
had -- made that a place to hide, dugged out the hole and stayed there, and he was already
lucky. The army had been going passing by, the German army. And the German soldier,
who was one of our workers, who worked with us to Gilligan's (ph) place, knew -- got in
in the place. Maybe want to get a drink of water, maybe was looking for Mendleson. I
don't want what it was. But Wilson, the neighbor, told me that. And he shot him in the
back and killed him the last minute of the liberation. And he was a tall, nice young man.
And no luck, and finished.

Q:When you went -- you told me that the Russians came in, you met them, and your first thought
was you wanted to go back to Kovno.

A:Uh-huh, the ghetto.

Q:So after you -- after the Russians liberated you, you went back to Kovno with them?

A:No. I went by myself. I didn't need nobody. I ran; I didn't walk. Everybody was too slow for
me. I was flying.

Q:By yourself?

A:By myself to the ghetto. People saying, "What's the matter, man? What's you running?" I
told Mr.â€˜ Wilson, it was a man who let me stay in his house, oh, a couple nights before I
got settled in Kaunas. But in the meantime, I went -- I went there by myself and I run in
the ghetto. I knew I had to see a picture. I see it, and it was terrible stage for my eyes.
Here is laying a hiding place with the man Monkey (ph), Monk's hiding place. The name
-- they call the nickname Monk. And he had the best possibility to make a hiding place,
because they had a money, they had the material, and he done it. And you couldn't find
the place nowhere to search. That's where he was. My mother, she still was in his hole
too, because they told me in ghetto yet that my mother, "Don't worry about your mother.
She got the best place. She got the Monk's Melina," they call it. And it was too hard to
find it. Nothing. I went brick by brick, piece by piece, looking around inside, in the peat.
Couldn't find nothing. I had to leave. I had to ask the people, maybe the neighbors,
maybe they know. They say, well, they don't know what's happened. Could be it was a
lot of fire going on. When they used to find out the place that people didn't report to go
by train back to Germany, they used to put them on fire, burn them up. And here is one.
Another one was Vinetrop (ph), was another hiding place. And they say it's only a
question of minutes they'll be liberated. They were all full of hope that they'll be
released, but it didn't work that way. And there was maybe about 10 people, they laying
outside of the ghetto. They also been put the place in the hiding on fire, but they start
running and been shot and been killed and be laying. There was a young girl, a friend of
mine -- her father was a friend of mine, laying in front. His father and mother all burned.
And here going around -- and then people, funny, going around. A woman with a big

stick, with a long piece of metal at the end, and digging in the groundlooking. I say,
"What you doing?" He say, "I'm looking for the Jews' gold," it was the answer. Well,
and come back.

Q:The fires were still going?

A:Some of them was glowing underneath, yeah. Not -- it was all burned up. It was nothing left.
But some of them were still. And one -- one was lucky. They did now. Hoop (ph) was a
rabbi, and the elf (ph) people, two handymens (ph) been hiding under a brick and under
cement blocks. A homes built on cement hard blocks. And they were -- they're laying in
the basement. And also hided entrance that nobody -- or somebody will come and see
and say, "No way to go in here. Nobody's there." But the building collapsed, and all of
them survived by miracles. They were hollering and hollering from the outside. There
was one rock keep the people up, don't let them to be squished. And they got out.
Somebody helped them. I was in there at that time, too. Yeah. It was awful. Then I
came back looking for my sister's furniture. My sister just got married and she bought
beautiful veneer, a bedroom set and a living room. And there was a Lithuanians, and she
gave it to them to hold it. Who'll come first. If she'll come first, she'll take it back or I'll
take it back or I'll buy it. It was beautiful furniture. But I come up to the building. It was
just a brand new building being built by a professor from Lithuania, from the university.
And it was a old woman left. They all disappeared, the people who lived in that house,
but I had to find the furniture. You could see the table was stained. The coffee was still
steaming, still going like steam. And ham and eggs and good -- a good meal. They ate
and left it half eaten, didn't have time to finish to eat and they run off. And they run away
and stay away for three months. Finally, get them back. Was no use for me to keep
there, so I could go and buy me a home.

Q:So you went -- did you then go back and get Edna and Jay?

A:Yeah, right. They still were in the farm there by her uncle. I went back and got them, brought
them. And I went to work to my job. You see, I was the second time under the Russians
in that time. I got my job as a dispatcher. And then I was the Jewish Council working
for the different kind of trials with the communists and the people. And I had problem
with the survivors. A lot of girls came back, I think -- did I told you that? See it was
concentration camp come back, people to Lithuania, to Kovno, to Slobodka, come
looking for their parents, for their relatives. And it wasn't a job that was easy to find, but
finally we got them together. I was in charge of candy factories. I was in charge of
cakes. All this stuff, I was in charge of it. I had special groups in room, and we used to
bake it and make it and sell it. And when the Russian people used to get cards, card
system. They getting for cards so many pounds of sugar, or for so many pounds of sugar
you getting so many pounds of candy. And that's the way I used to divide that everybody
should get it. Comes a holiday, I used to work it out that they should have some sweets
for the holidays. But then they start fighting with each other. Woman fight with each
other. It's a job, and I am in the middle. And what I done, I took -- I had to separate --
separate. You a Jewish lady, you stay in that part of the table or that room, and you work
in that room, and don't let them fight with each other.

A:But I kept them separated. They couldn't have been fighting with each other. They were -- in
a way I can't blamed them. They were hungry. They had been eating the raw dough. I
could see they're eating it. I say, "You'll get sick." No. They were -- anyhow, they
reported, and in come -- the year, the Gestapo, they go and in come -- in come the
criminal police. And they called me in and give me a warning. I say one more time and I
go get caught, I'll -- they send me Siberia. And I have no business to mingle in
government business. They were right, but I didn't have no choice. They were --

Q:Now, why did they think -- what were you doing wrong?

A:Well, I didn't have the right to give away the sugar and give away the candies when they got to
give for Russians by the Russian government. The Russian been giving it out. It comes

A:I had the job already in 1940 before the war. Before the war was the Russians, the
communists, together with the Germans together divided Lithuanian in half. Half of
Lithuanian Poland belonged to the Russians and half --

Q:I thought then you were working for a transportation cooperative?

A:Right. That was already later. This was before. But later they were the cooperative with the
horse and buggy. I worked for them, and they helped me to get my job.

met you mother back in Kennicksburg. I met your sister." We were thinking it's true. I
say, "Well, we're going in Kovno and we go find out." I came in Kovno and I see the
Jewish girl go around to the Gestapo man. It was the captain from the brigade -- from
Sunsulaga (ph) there. They had a laga, what they call it? A place of work that was a
factory, and they been working at the factory. And I don't remember the -- how it was in
the details. I had to give up.

Q:But you didn't find your family. Were the Lithuanians -- when you came back, did the
Lithuanians treat you okay?

A:Yeah. I think I had no troubles. They wouldn't treat me, I wouldn't get a job. I gota job. I
didn't have any problems at all. But the Lithuanians with the Jewish girls been fighting.
And then I got five drums of gasoline came in. I said, "What is that for?" He say they
don't know. I got to take it. I've been allocated five drums of benzine for the trafay
(ph)," which means the . And I need to go and find a machine or anything to get in
Germany for home. I said have enough gasoline, trucks are no problem. I said get it and
bring it back. They call it a trafay. And that's the way it was with me. I came home. I
start looking for family. I couldn't find nobody. Decide to move on. And then I had

AI get out -- when I got a job, went to the Russian. I stayed there and worked with them enough
till the girls start fighting, and I decide I go separate them. One group here and one go
there and there be peace. And I put on a big sign, "No vacancies." I don't have any work.
They shouldn't bother me, so let me work. And they reported, and they come -- the
Russian city police, and they come and run to me and they say, "Who give you the right"
-- and I didn't like that -- "to say who should live" -- I mean, "who should be the boss
over the factory and who not. You do what the government tells you to do. Don't do any
wrong. Here is you got to know is a Russian system, a communist system. It's not a
capitalistic way of doing it." And they lay me out and put me in jail. And here I am
laying there. My luck was that the office was -- the office girl was a sister of one of my
bosses for the Russians whom I was working, and she went and called up her brother and
told him that I am locked up. And here my boss was a Russian captain, come up. He
say, "What you doing here? What's happened?" I say, "I don't know. They locked me
up." "For what?" I say, "They say I bought -- for gas, I bought a truck. I had to have a
truck. What good is for me four drums of gasoline when I don't have any truck?" And
this is the way the system works for the Russians. And they say, "Wait a minute. They
cannot tell you what to do, buy or not buy." And it was a general came up and he needs
the gas, and you got the truck, and you got a merchandise he wants. "I need your gas to
swap you for a truck," and I got a opal (ph) car -- I mean an opal truck, a ton and a-half
ton, for two drums of gasoline. Then I had transportation around _, got two
and a mechanic. And everybody were working. Nobody was looking for jobs, and I
gave them jobs. But a girl report me, what I was doing. I told her -- I told them

Tape 5

Q:This may sound like kind of a strange question, because I think there were different points at
which your life became more and more difficult. But is there one moment when what we
say "the Holocaust," when that really began for you, when you realized how serious the
situation was?

A:In what year?

Q:Well, you tell me. At what point did you realize that this wasn't just a short war or that things
were really very, very, horrible for the Jewish people? When did that begin for you?

A: It begin as soon as we got in into the ghetto. It was you take a human being and lock him up.
Lock me up, but I wasn't -- wasn't ready to be locked up. I was still in my prime life. I
was 39 years of age, and they're going to lock me up. And then the pagrom. What I
couldn't take it is the Lithuanians. I had Lithuanians lawyers, friends. They used to --
like for Passover, for example. I used to take five, six judges coming with me and we
having the Passover services. I was so close. Stenitis (ph). They hadtoldmetwo__.
One was Stenitis, was a good friend of mine, Stenitis. His brother. And say, oh, I
mingled with them, friendly. I know I'm alive because they -- when the city pagrom was
going out -- going around, they come up to my house and stopped. Why? I am positive
sure that one of my friends was Hollincare (ph), say, "You don't go to Ipson. Skip that
house," because I have a feeling that they were going next to me. But I still, still here.
Somebody stopped. Well, that what was a difficult life. And then the nice people, Edna's
family, losing Edna's family in -- in two minutes. And I was hot and angered at the
Jewish police. They didn't have to be involved in that kind of thing. I lost twice people

because of big shots. I could be a police any time. They all life is what's difficult. It was
not what's not difficult. And like with here, a life not concern it does. When I came in
this country, I went to work for Edna's uncle, who was an uncle the Pepsi-Cola owner
from Pepsi-Cola in Munich -- in Richmond. And I worked hard for her uncle. I wouldn't
even let me smoke a cigarette. One day he comes in and he stop where I stay at night and
working, and he tells me, I say, "Well, what you going to do next?" I say, "I don't know
yet." I say, "Well, I got a job for you," her uncle tells me. I say, "What is it?" I say, "To
run my bottle machines. I have troubles with the machines, and the mechanic there is a
drunk. Every day he's drunk, and I'm in troubles. I got to have my equipment working. I
can't make any money. I can't make a living the machines staying still." I say, "What
you want from me?" "I want to give you a better job you got." The job I'm talking, 1947,
he been paying me $65 a week. I say, "Well, I'm not interested in doing nothing." He
say, "I give you $100 week." I say, "Give me $100 a week? What I going to do with
$100?" Well, "Tell me why you won't. What is your reason," he say, "when you were
able to do yourself better." He was a smart man, the old man. I asked him the queston. I
told him, I say, "Look, America is a country of wheels. Everything goes on wheels. You
go stay and look. Go take a look, how many wheels pass by in the minutes we're
standing and talking to each other. Everything goes on wheels, and I want to roll with
them. I don't want you to stop me from rolling. I -- what good is for me your job? I'm
not too much interested." And here I tell you another mistake you made. You know, you
got to be -- in life you got to be careful. Here comes Serret (ph). Serret -- you remember
Serret? Serret was the foreign minister from Israel who was before in Benger Young's
times. And he deliver a speech in Richmond. I was at his speech making. After he
finish speaking, I come with the uncle and I introduce him in Hebrew, introduce him
Serret. And he tells to Serret, "You know, I want to build a plant of Pepsi-Cola in Israel.
Can I do it?" I say, "Sure, you can do it. No question about it. But it will be certain
requirement. You know, one thing that -- Israel got enough grapes, got enough food, and

they can make the syrup, they make from all that stuff from our ingredients." He say,
"Well, but you know, I want to build for my grandchildren," Edna's uncle tells Serret. I
say, "Well," he say, "I build for them a future." Then it made me hot. I say, "You want
me," I say, "go to Israel, vote for you to secure the life for your grandchildren, and my
grandchildren shall work for you? No, I'm not going. I don't want that."

Q:What do you think it was about your background that made you strong, that got you through
all of this the way you did?

A:Made you strong?

Q:That gave you the strength to survive all of this. Was it something about your background?

A:Right. Right.

Q: What?

A:Without my education, I wouldn't be able to accomplish nothing. Everything education helped
me. It was not hard for me. When I took the job, I knew the language. I knew the
history of the people. I knew what to say and what to do. And -- what I should say
"Yes" and not say "No." The only trouble I -- remained after the war me and Edna, but
no more closer people. We couldn't help it. Only want to have a little happiness. More
happiness here right now. I got a good business. Everything all right, but still not
fulfilled.

Q:lt's still not fulfilled?

A:Huh-uh. Still not fulfilled.

Q:After the war when you came over to the Unitedâ€™ States, did you talk -- did -- at least among
your family, did you talk about your experiences?

A:They knew.

Q:I know they knew, but did you talk about it together?

A:Yes. I talked, and they didn't like to hear it, to be honest with you. They didn't -- back 5
I think we are talking. A lot of them they think that I telling a lie, that I am not telling the
truth, because they figure that a person couldn't survive, couldn't go through life with that
kind of a problems all day after day. And they didn't want to listen. They didn't want to
listen. They didn't want me to speak no more. And not only me, all the survivors. Don't
talk. It was a rough time until lately, yeah, the museum helps a little. But until the
museum come, they don't want -- nobody want to listen. I say, "The American people
don't listen to us anyhow. They're used to talking. They are used to doing. It's a waste
of time."

Q:Were you able to put it behind you then?

A:l did. Right now a lot of thing here. When I came in this country ,l gota
brother-in-law here living with me this month, Edna's sister's husband. And I told him,
"Milton, you know, let's go make -- I got a good business for us both together. Let's go in
partners. I got two businesses. One business," I say, "you can pick auto parts. Open up a
business auto parts. You be the salesman. I'll tell you what to sell, you go and sell it,
only sell it. Or a paper clip factory. Why? Why a paper clip? A paper clip factory, you

can run it by yourself. You don't need any help. The machinery runs it, and you make a
living. Only thing you need is to go on out and sell it, to go to the wholesaler -- paper
wholesaler and sell it." And I say, "You would be perfect for me, because you know the
language, and you just got back from the army, and you the right man." "No," he say,
"take it easy. I don't want that kind of business. I don't want it." He is nothing, have
nothing. He's a big nothing. What I beg him to be a member -- a partner with me, and I
have anything I want. I got an apartment. I say I can get him $200,000 and from
fingers. I got a machine shop. I got one piece of machinery just $250, the cranks and
grinder. I have the best machinists in Richmond working for me. Well, and now with
Jay in the business, and Jay already working on his little one, he should be -- yeah. And
first thing he comes in he runs into the computer and types.

Q:What sort of -- how do you feel that your experiences during the war, during the Holocaust,
affected the way you live your life now or the way you lived your life for the last 40
years or so? Do you think it had a lasting impact that made you do things differently or
value certain things differently than you might have?

A:I tell you, I know -- I'm sure I had to do it. I'm sure I done it. While in my business I felt out
that you cannot leave it out a community. You got to be a community person. You got
to see to help, tobe active _â€”_â€”, to be active. And I am. I got more awards -- I say, so
many sticker. But I got a Distinguished Community Service Award. I got a Christian
Jews Conference. I got a Naborite Service Award. I got a Naborite top lot president -- I
got plenty. And it's not because I got pushing it out. No, the way it comes itself. I feel
because I went through life so different variations, movements, that now everybody --
everybody. I say everybody. A lot of people come to me ask advices. Why do they ask
for advices? For my experience. I went through hell. I give my advice. I say, "What's
the matter? You going to tell me I don't know what I'm talking about or you don't know

what you talking about? You don't know what you want. You know what you want. But
you got to make up my mind." People want to go and want to have it done for nothing.
You can't get nothing for nothing. Well --

Q:ls there anything today that frightens you, that takes you right back to that bad period?

A:Right. Didn't I mention to you? Funny how we talk sometimes. I can't remember with whom
I spoke.

Q:Tell me.

A:That now the government repeat, it repeats itself. Particularly Europe. They -- the Balkans,
what's going on in the Balkans is terrible. And who go have the -- we go expect a war
with the Lithuanians and Poles. I don't know. I have a feeling like that, because they
going the same way as they went in 1947, '48.

Q:And that frightens you?

A:That frightens me. Who wants to have it? We had enough. We don't need any wars no more.
And the way it's going now, you never know what's going to happen. They still cannot
settle between theirselves the arguments. The politicians, they are a bunch of no-goods.

Q:ls there anything, just the ordinary life in the United States, that frightens -- that makes you
think of the past and --

A:Yeah, there was a easier life. Now we going -- we going over a new period of life which we
can't compare. Now the computer price -- the computer life, 1 mean. The computer life,

it's a new way of life, and it is changed the human being. In the next 10 years, we don't
go recognize ourself.

Q:But I may be -- I'm not explaining my question very well.

What I'm trying to ask you is, if in just the daily life today there are certain things, certain
sounds, certain things you see or think about, that all of a sudden make you remember something
50 years ago and are very disturbing that bring it back to you?

A:The street life. It is terrible. The murders, murdering, suing each other, children problems.
The cancer problems, cancer sickness. They would kill this cancer when they would put
their mind in it. I don't believe it, it's not that it couldn't be conquered. But every other
thing, all kind of items, and the making the life miserable for their own self in
place of making it beautiful, beautiful life. But they don't straighten out, it will be rough,
because I can see a lot of -- a lot of fights here going on. And, well --

Q:What message should we learn from all of this? From everything you've told me, what should
somebody who's listening to this take away from it, the most important thing?

A:What people should learn from this?

Q:Yeah.

A:They should learn a new life, because a life is now come to a dead point. And mostly land is
controls the people's life. Land and girls, and all the fights with one with each other,
killing each other. Here it's not as bad as in little Richmond. It is a village. It's not a
night for two, three killings. Blacks, whites. Mostly blacks. Whites is not so bad. But
still a human being, I don't care who it is. And something life itself, when itself without

help and change. Life need help. It needs to get out from their assistance. We need to
help the economy got to have a boost. And, well, too much inner fighting between one
and the other. Very, very hard. They still talking?

Q:Yeah. Do you think in the world, is religion really that important?

A:No. No. I don't care about religion. Religion brings no -- we got to be mixed in between one
and another. It's rough. And it started in Iran. It were the biggest problems. And then
there's Lebanon -- the Middle East, another war should come up.

Q:But you are a practicing Jew?

A:Yes.

Q:Religion is important to you?

A:Right. Because -- well, it is religion like here. Listen two weeks ago was a rabbi in
Richmond. He been talking. And he say the only thing what he wants is to conservative,
conservative Jew. And he say there, what we got to do every day, we got to put on
chilum (ph). You know what chilum is? You know up around there. And we got to see
to help and to do and to pray. And it wouldn't give me nothing. All this, what's we get
for the human being. Right now we still don't see nothing. We say -- I didn't see yet
after 50 years to get rid of Hitler would start coming back, everything. Here I've been
talking 50 years ago to the same farmer, Paskofski, living outside and talking to Mr.
Paskofski, "What do you think about life?" That's what we be talking. I'd be asking him
right there by the door from the Holocaust. And he say, "You know, you so right. You
so right." That I say, "Let's -- I can tell you one thing. We still going to have a beautiful

life in front of us. I don't see it yet." Italkto___â€”.x [know him. He came to
Richmond, and I talked with him. I say, "Tell me something. I cannot understand how
come until this day nothing didn't been done about the Holocaust." He say, "Such a
tragedy happen to the Jewish people, what have you done about it? You should know
what to talk. It's you should know how to answer the questions. Where are you? What
you doing? You're telling me__," it's a little story where they mean nothing. He
say, "Let me tell you something. History is not written in a day. History doesn't been
written ina month. History takes years to write. The Holocaust will take 50 years before
the historian will start doing anything." Right. Smart. I say, "You right. I agree with
you on that." But don't wait until 200 years; 50 years is enough. We lived the 50 years,
and now give us what we need. Give us peace. It's enough. I was with him for a good
while. He's a smart man. Some of them didn't like him, but I liked him. He is one of the
prophets. Very interesting.

Q:Is there anything else you want to -- I don't have any more questions. Is there anything else
you want to say?

A:I don't know. The main thing what I want to say was to get ready of thought of Holocaust.
We should never -- not have any Holocaust problems. We should be out of the books.
We should get ready world, all the dopes (ph) and all the sicknesses and all the killings.
It's unbelievable to be seen a person today, a young person start dying because of nothing
been done about it. A week ago a man, a good friend of ours, he's only 56 years of age.
Cancer. All why? Well, his time comes, he got to go, they say. That is their answer.
That's not the answer. The answer is we're not doing enough. I remember when my
grandfather died at what, 56. He was already old man. He died, and he was 56 years of
age, but he can still live another 30. Well, well, sometimes you done a lot of wrong
things to yourself. You can be smart enough. You need help and other people too to

advise you. Life is not a life of one man. We have certain people think they are. Get
