A: I brought it if now from Lithuania, from a sanitarium, where there were some
people from White Russia, and when I told them that I know Nesvizh they were
very excited and they send me photographs of Nesvizh, how Nesvizh looks now.
And they called Nesvizh the pearl of White Russia.
Q: And why is it so? Why — why is Nesvizh so special?
A: I think that mostly thanks to the family of the Radziwells, because they heard in
Nesvizh there might be a big palace. I don’t know if there is a second such in the
former Poland. And around the palace was a beautiful park. And the Catholic
priests brought Italian artists, who painted the churches in Nesvizh. So, it was a
small town, but some very excellent in architecture, in culture, and in Jewish life,
too.
Q: In what way — what was special in Jewish life in Nesvizh?
A: In Jewish life, the most of the people were intelligentsia.

You’re the geographer, she’s the dentist. Were there any other people who were
close to you at those years?
A: I will tell you, there is, in my biography a lot of details. But I will repeat the
most important. My mother’s sister, Mina(ph) was a massage-ist in the
Druskininkai. That’s why almost every year I am coming to the Druskininkai for
two weeks, and I see some of the forest there, and for me is a great, tragic pleasure
to see it. So, I went to the cemetery of people who were killed in Druskininkai.
Most of the people were Russians, and there was written their military —

said that yes, I am from Druskininkai. I was a partisan against Hitler. All the Jews
from Druskininkai were taken to Grodno and executed.
Q: That would mean your aunt as well.
A: And among them was my mother’s sister, the massage-ist, Mina(ph). In Nesvizh
my mother had a brother, Zahar(ph). Zahar(ph) was killed in Nesvizh very fast,
because the Germans had the impression that his son has sympathies for leftist. So
he was executed almost immediately, maybe the second or third day in Nesvizh. He
was a composer, and I have probably here some notes that he composed. And some
of his songs, I know from my memory, and I would want to — to — to make some —
some use of that.
Q: Could you sing something? Would you mind singing one of those songs? Do you

A: Yes, that they saw that all the Jews were executed in Grodno. From many

who speak almost so well, how I am speaking Russian. And born in Nikopol’, so it
is Russia. So, to en — together I am theirs, you know. So I have very strong
sentiments to Russian culture, to the Russian people, but not to the Russian

Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: Because politics are very different, with a lot of facts, subjective facts. The
Polish look different today, different they looked 15 years ago, so I try to be very
neutral, and my politics is the politics of America.

who’s 20 years old, or 19 years old, who’s in the Soviet army, and li— and you

A: Yes. In the gymnasium of Slovatski(ph) in Vilnius was a legya(ph), legya(ph), a
legion of young people who had a military training. But not all the Jews were there.
Some, if they were [indecipherable] but if they were young [indecipherable].

blockade of [indecipherable]. It is the one book where there is no subjective to — to
much moments. He wrote how it was, everything. It is — it is terrible. You are
walking through the streets and you are seeing dozens of dying people. This author
said that in the hunger in Leningrad died one million population. One million; not
military, civil population. And he said that the history doesn’t know a second such
case that 900 days you don’t give up, and Hitler can’t take Leningrad. The
marshals of Hitler came close the gates of the city, and they brought even stones to
build a monument for Hitler, for their fuehrer. And we did, 20 years old guys, we
said no. No. Ended. No was true.

instead of bread, sukardi(ph). It’s made — it means pieces of bread baked on — on —

A: This is — this was my — my eating, but it came a better time, as they send my unit

A: Ladoga is the largest lake in Europe. It is between Finland and between Russia.
The Finnish said that all Ladoga has to belong to them, and the Russians say that
all Ladoga has to belong to the Russians. On the Ladoga were points where trucks
winter were going through the snow and the ice, through the Ladoga, through the —

Q: At that time, when you were in Ladoga, were the Finns shooting at the Russians
or not, and the Russians shooting at the Finns?
A: I would say that the Finns wanted to look more gentlemen than the Germans. I
feel so, that they threw less shells on the Russian territora — territory than the
Germans. I have a such feeling, because in Leningrad was inscriptions on the
walls, where is safer to — to walk. So, if you look what is written, it is written so,
like most of the shells would come from the dort — from the Finns. Less from the
Finns and more from the south.
Q: From the Germans.
A: From the Germans. I have a such impression. And the author of the book writes
that the dictator of Finland was a administered by the tsar in Russia. So, he even

westwards to Berlin. Do you know, did you see any of that?

Russia, can you forget about everything else? Because they didn’t leave White

Sahara. So, to — to compare if a young Russian tried something, yes, it is very bad,

A: No, my friend, but I have with Nesvizh very strong contacts. Dr. Cholawksy,
and one of the main workers in the — the Hebrew organization. An organization who
has to do with the Holocaust —
Q: Yeah.
A: —is there, from Nesvizh. And another schlar(ph) was in gymnasium in Nesvizh
together with me.
Q: Did you —I guess my larger question is, did you go back to any of the places,
whether it was Wilno, whether it was Nesvizh, whether it was the various towns
you had been with your mother, after the war, to see what they looked like?
A: In general, not. But I was close to Ponary, and Ponary is a station close to
Landwarow.
Q: Lentvaris.
A: Ponary is from Vilnius nine kilometers, and Landwarow, 18. How they say in

Mickiewicza is — on the wall of the court before the war in — in Vilnius, the Polish

is it? And the Jewish guy explained me, that the Lithuanians said that the Jews were
criminals. That they killed the Lithuanians because the Lithuanians were Soviet
spies. But I imagine that when the Polish Jewish Jews in Vilnius came back to their
houses, and they knew from the population, from — from many other sources, who
was the real spies for Hitler, they came to the Soviets, and the Soviets do what with
the young, what they could do with somebody else. Or they could do with — with

Q: When did you find out — you see, when you were talking to me before about how
Belarus was no more, that it was a Sahara, that could be — that — that shows
German brutality, Nazi brutality, collaborator brutality in wartime. When did you
learn that there was something particular? When did you learn of the Holocaust?
When did you first see the results that this was against the Jews, that this was a
genocide?
A: Okay, Iam very glad that you are asking about that. I’m very glad. The
Holocaust was in several acts. Sometimes very late, and sometimes immediate. The
immediate are Ponary, the Jerusalem of Lithuania. The immediate was Nesvizh,
because in Nesvizh was a very hard Jewish community. An intelligent Jewish
community in Nesvizh. And in Nesvizh they collected all the population on the
market, maybe two weeks after [indecipherable] Nesvizh, and they killed
everybody. There is maybe — maybe 10 people were —
Q: Survived.
A: Survived. And the White Russian peasantry was a lot more sympathetic to Jews
than Polish. So, is it— so they destroyed almost all the Nesvizh community. And in
one entry of a — of a very poor house in Nesvizh, stood a lady and took a girl from

know. And the girl was saved by the lady who took her. And she was married by
my friend who is Yad Vashem, who is working there. And thanks her, he is still
alive. He is over 90.
Q: Oh my, oh my.
A: Yes.
Q: But my question is again, a personal question. When did you personally, where
were you when you realized that this was a genocide against the Jews? When did
you find out, when did you realize this was not just war, and horrible war, but this
was also a genocide?
A: First I have small signals. In the Soviet press, in the military Soviet press, a little
about. And I slept with a Jewish guy, Schlitzer(ph) was his name. And Schlitzer
shed — said, do you know that the Germans are killing all the Jews? I was very
careful. All the Jews? Yes, all the Jews. Yes, I believe. I believe that they could it
do, because I am from a classical gymnasium, and I know that the Latin poets said,
horror Germanicus(ph). That the main feelings in Germany is horror
Germanicus(ph). The Belgians are very nice people, but the Germans are a horror.
Two thousand years write a Latin words that the main characteristic of Germans is
horror.

A: I told you yes, it is possible. It is possible. And it was finished, the dispute. If he
was a schmekel, so he told somebody else about speaking with me. He was not a
schmekel, so I told him the truth. It was the first klagator(ph).
Q: Yeah, the first notes.
A: But when I heard more and more about that, and people are — are writing full
pages and all that? Hey. So it is absolutely true. And when I ber — began to get news
from Dr. Cholawsky, and news from the guy whose wife saves him, his life, and all
that. So naturally it is absolutely true, and the news were brighter and brighter and
brighter. And I came to Druskininkai, and from Nesvizh people told me that 6,000
Jews in Nesvizh were killed. It means hundred percent.
Q: Again, you learned that recently, you say, and I’m interested in after the war.
Did you, in Katowice, when you met your future wife, did you already have an idea
that this — that this was complete, that this was a full genocide?
A: In time of war?
Q: Right after the war, yeah.

couldn’t find their street, their street. They didn’t find not only the houses, but they
