Answer: ...was Eva Irene. She was born in 1927. My family background was that I
am, my parents were completely assimilated in German culture and in the German way of
life and there were very few of Jewish observances. My mother went with us to the
synagogue on the high holidays, that is the only thing I remember. I remember much
more distinctly, however, that we celebrated Christmas, we had a Christmas tree every
year, Santa Claus came and distributed gifts and I grew up really knowing very little
about being Jewish except I knew that I was Jewish. My, also my father had a very
extensive library, he was actually generally very widely read and widely educated. I do
not remember any Jewish books, the books that we had were just general literature,
German writers, Shakespeare, of course. The particular pride of my father was a 54
volume edition of the collected works of Goethe, the German playwright and philosopher
of the early 19th Century. We were, as far as I can tell, relatively well off. We went on
summer vacations every year and I particularly was sent during the summer vacations,
from maybe the age of 10 on or so, toa camp. These camps were usually all Jewish
camps. They were headed usually by a Jewish sports teacher and were located, they were
different from American camps in that they didn't have a specific camp location, but
instead the head of the camp, the sports teacher, would contract with some vacation
owner of a building, of a vacation house, in the mountains or near the sea to rent that
house for a period of about four weeks, I guess, or six weeks, and then he would take the
kids to that place and, of course, with a number of assistants and so on. I personally
would have liked much better to be going on vacations with my parents, but my father
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 2
worked very hard and I was always told that my father needed complete rest and
relaxation and that it was just too much of a commotion if we kids would also come
along. And usually what happened was, after a few days of being home sick then I got
sort of sucked into the activities of the camp, made some friends and, in some of the
cases, actually some school friends of mine from the school in Berlin were at the same
camp, so I had already ready-made friends there. From then on, I usually enjoyed these
vacations. My contacts with Judaism really became stronger basically out of two events.
The first one was Hitler's assumption of power in, generally, 1933, where in the school
where I was I was made to feel that I was different. The first year there was very little
Nazi activity in the school. The school I went to, incidentally, was the Mommsen
Gymnasium named after the German historian of the Roman Empire, Theodor
Mommsen, who actually personally was a very liberal minded historian. And
Gymnasium, in German means really classical high school. That school received, got a
new principal in the year 1934, he was a retired Army colonel who had fought in the First
World War and also was a through and through convinced Nazi ideologue. And right
after his assumption of the principal-ship, he announced in a school assembly that it is his
goal to make the school a sort of example for Nazi ideological indoctrination. At that
point, many Jewish kids were taken out of that school by their parents and sent to other
schools. I stayed in and after one year of that principal, only two kids, Jewish kids, were
left, another boy and I. The principal introduced all kinds of new activities like, for
example, before the beginning of the school day, the entire school had to assemble for
sort of like a military roll call. Behind the school building there was a big sports field
and we assembled there and had to stand at military attention and while the principal read
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 3
a particular paragraph that he had selected for that day out of Hitler's book, Mein Kampf,
as sort of motto for the day. And during lunch hour, after we had eaten our food, we
usually marched, the entire school in military formation, through the streets of the
neighborhood, singing Nazi songs. After one year of his principal-ship, as I said there
were two kids left, and he asked us to come into his office and that, in Germany, where
the principal in general is a much more fearsome authority than you see now. In addition
to that, of course, we knew where he stood, for us it was a somewhat intimidating
experience. When we were in his office he told us that he could not really see having
Jewish children in his school, which he wanted to make as a purely Germanic or Aryan
school serving as an example for all other schools in Germany. But, he also had no legal
way to expel us from the school, so he thought about it and came to the following
conclusion, that there were basically two options. Either our parents withdrew us
voluntarily or he would simply resign the principalship because he would not be able,
under those conditions, to carry out his goals, and with that message we were sent home.
Our fathers got together on the telephone and discussed that this was obviously a veiled
threat and we were never sent back to that school.

Question: I was surprised when you mentioned that you were sent to a Jewish camp.

A: Yeah, well, after 1933, there was increasing pressure really for, to keep Jews and
non-Jews apart. I think maybe in '33 or '34, I may still have been in a mixed camp, but
after that, such camps simply didn't exist anymore. Actually, there was an additional
reason, that all youth activities for Germans were progressively taken over by the Hitler
Youth Organization. They went on summer excursions, on hikes and so on, and German
children initially were just sort of socially pressured to participate, but I think in the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 4
mid-'30's, I don't remember the year, maybe '36 or so, it was actually made compulsory,
that every German kid, as a boy, had to be in the Hitler Youth and it had a parallel girls
organization which was called, it was a German word, Bund Deutscher Madel , it means
Association of German Girls, and girls were compulsorily in that organization. And if
there were any organizations outside of the Hitler Youth, they definitely would not be
permitted to have any Jewish children in them, so that was not a religious thing, these
camps. Actually, I remember one camp where I was where the head was actually a
woman sports teacher and she was a very strong Zionist and she would have Friday
evening Shabbat ceremonies and carry on other Jewish activities. And in all the other
camps, they were Jewish only to the extent that both the head and teachers, as well as all
the kids, were Jews, but otherwise, there were no Jewish related activities.

Q: Now, prior to Hitler, do you remember any instances of antisemitism, did you get
along well with your neighbors and your schoolmates?

A: Yes. No, I mean, I don't remember such instances. I always got along, the strange
thing is that practically all, with one exception, all of my friends were always Jewish
kids. That happened somehow naturally, I don't know. There was truly no, I wasn't told
by my parents to have Jewish friends exclusively, but that's the way it turned out. But
even after Hitler came to power, I had, I mean I had no, I do not remember any incidents
where I was either attacked or had any violence on the part of my German school
children. In fact, initially, my reaction to the Nazi seizure of power was that I felt sorry
for myself for not being an Aryan, I mean, a German kid, and that I couldn't participate in
all the what I considered fun things that they were doing, games and so on, and it was
really only after I was expelled from the German school, actually, let me back up. I said
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 5
earlier that my relationship to Judaism changed drastically for two reasons. I mean, one
was Hitler's accession to power and, which basically forced me to confront my
Jewishness, the other was my bar mitzvah, which came up in 1935 and which required
me to take, several times a week, preparatory lessons, both for my, for the parshah which
I was going to read from the Torah on the Shabbat during services on my bar mitzvah, as
well as additional sort of Jewish history and some Hebrew. And that, and then on top of
it also, in 1935 was my expulsion from the Mommsen Gymnasium by this antisemitic
principal, and my parents then transferred me to a very orthodox Jewish school. That has
always been a puzzle in my mind, my parents never explained it. There were other
Jewish schools which were much less orthodox, but they transferred me to the most
orthodox of Jewish schools in Berlin. In fact, it was a school associated with a sort of
separatist congregation, the, all of the, the rest of the Jewish community was in one large
sort of super congregation, I think that is in most European cities like that, where Jewish
communal life, is handled by one big congregation and that congregation also is
responsible for building synagogues according to different needs. I mean, there were one
or two reform synagogues in Berlin and many what was called liberal synagogues, that
was the sort of predominant denomination. In spite of the name, the liberal synagogues
were about very close to what is called conservative here in this country. The service
was almost entirely in Hebrew with only one or two prayers in German, however, in most
liberal synagogues, organs were also present and otherwise, the service, also the selection
of prayers, was basically the same as that in the conservative synagogues and much more
extensive than in the reform synagogues in this country, but all of the synagogues were
essentially the responsibility of this central congregation and also there were a number of
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 6
orthodox synagogues. But the school into which I was transferred to was from a
separatist, very orthodox congregation affiliated with the Agudas Yisrael which is a
worldwide sort of umbrella organization of orthodox congregations. I think the reason
was that school had an excellent reputation, while it obviously taught a lot of Judaism,
Hebrew and Jewish history and so on, but they, of course, they still were governed by the
German education law and had to provide, therefore, all of the curriculum that regular
German schools had to offer in mathematics and science and literature and so on. But,
obviously, that was a tremendous change for me, a change of cultures. Coming from the
militaristic Nazi school, now to a very orthodox Jewish school which, at the beginning
when I came there, seemed to be without any semblance of discipline. I, myself, have
always been somewhat of a rebel in the sense that I resented authority, and even in the
Mommsen Gymnasium, which was governed by this Prussian ex-officer, there were a
number of boys to whom I also belonged to, sort of tried to get away with things. Now
when I came to that Jewish school, I really reveled in the fact that there seemed to be no
discipline at all and people even talked back to their teachers and I must say, I enjoyed
that very much and in spite of that, the funny thing is I learned. The thing is that the
excuse for extreme discipline is always that it is needed in order for the kids to learn, I
mean I realize there has to be a certain amount of discipline, but in the German schools,
at least at the Nazi time, that was an ideology by itself, in its own right, discipline, of
course, as a preparation for later military.

Q: Now, didn't you experience antisemitism from your schoolmates at the Mommsen
school?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 7
A: I don't, no I didn't. In fact, one, I remember that one of my non-Jewish, we weren't
really friends, but we sort of spent some time together frequently in school during
intermissions and so on, recess is the word, recess, he was, he had joined the Hitler Youth
and he had given me a small Hitler Youth pennant with a swastika which I proudly
displayed. And, unfortunately, it turned out that on that day we had, at home a party, I
forgot what the cause was, there were relatives there and, of course, all the people who
came were Jews, and in the middle of it, I burst with my swastika flag and holding it
proudly and marched in there. And I remember that my mother took me very forcefully
by my arm, took me out to my room and gave me a horrific beating and told me that I
should never dare to bring that flag home and she tore it up and I felt terribly sorry for
myself and felt as a victim of, but as I said, that was in the beginning when I felt that
being Jewish was basically a punishment and it took a number of jolts for me to realize
really what was behind that and also what my Judaism really meant to me. The
antisemitism that I encountered was mainly from the teachers. That principal, maybe I
forgot to mention that he also taught, that was I think common in German schools, and he
was our math teacher and he made frequent antisemitic remarks and derogatory remarks
about Jews in his mathematics class. And then we had a German teacher who was, if
anything, even worse and, on the other hand, some of the older teachers were very
democratic. Our Latin teacher was an elderly gentleman, in fact was the only teacher
with whom, to whom my mother took me after I left school, very, from one day to the
next, to say goodbye. And he lived only a few blocks away from us and we went there
and he was, I still remember, very nice to me and shook my hand and wished me all the
best of luck for my future. So, I think some of the older teachers were definitely not
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 8
Nazis and most of the younger ones were. In addition, of course, the principal who was
an elderly gentleman, he must have been already in his late 50's at that time.

Q: How did you feel hearing these remarks by your teachers? Do you remember?

A: I felt hurt, basically. I felt that, I mean, it was really like a physical slap in the face,
except this was not physical but emotional. I mean, I felt, even at that time, that the men
had no reason to attack me that way.

Q: Did you talk about this with your parents? Did they make some sense out of it for
you?

A: I don't remember it, but it's possible that I did. I don't, I mean there are many things
that I don't really understand about my parents and I feel in a way terrible about it. Of
course, in the beginning I was too little, but later on I was a teenager and then finally an
upper teenager and even 20 years old by the time they were arrested. And, but I don't
really understand many of the actions they took and their motivations. That is one of the
things I have been trying for years and years sort of to reconstruct, no understanding now
how they thought and what their mental sort of outlook was to explain why they acted the
way they did. It's very difficult, for example, my father's decision during the first years
of Hitler not to emigrate was based, that is one thing, one of the few things I can
understand, as strange as it may sound. But the thing was that Jewish lawyers, a large
group of, the majority Jewish lawyers were disbarred within a few weeks after the Nazis
took power. There were two groups of lawyers which were exempted, one were the front
line soldiers from World War I, which my father was not, the other one were lawyers
who had already been admitted to the bar under the Kaiser, that means before the
outbreak of World War I and that's the category my father fell in. And many of the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 9
lawyers who were then disbarred lost their livelihood over night and the only thing they
could do, unless they wanted to dig ditches in Germany, was to emigrate, and most of
them did. On the other hand, my father always considered himself lucky that he was
exempted because at each stage of the Nazi development of their antisemitic policies, the
Jews always were under the illusion that this is the way, okay, the Nazis want to do
business and that's, but we can live with it and that's the way it's going to remain. In
retrospect, the fact that my father was in one of the exempted groups, was not his luck,
but it was his death sentence because otherwise he would have left Germany. In fact, one
remark I still remember vividly, when the others urged him to emigrate, he would say,
here I am a lawyer, if I go to New York, all I can become is a dishwasher, and what shall
I do with German law in New York? You know, logically, that made total sense, in '35,
who would have ever thought of gas chambers? Plus, the thought also was that since
Hitler was constantly breaking agreements with the Allies, and particularly with Britain
and France, that one of these days they would have enough and just take care of him. At
that time, their military force was still much bigger than that of Germany and my father
thought if I stay here, then I'll just pick up where I left off in '33 and all of that, you
know, if I think back, really made sense. In the framework, I mean putting myself into
the framework of my parents at that time and, of course, ignoring the history that
occurred later which you know is just hindsight. I mean, obviously, my parents also
were, and that may have been in general in those days, very sort of withdrawn in terms of
say financial things and so on. I mean, they never discussed any of these things with us
even as I got older, but I am now certain, looking back that the income of my father from
his law practice, must have plummeted. Because, first of all, many of his clients were
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 10
gentiles and there was, if a German gentile, so called Aryan, appeared in court with a
Jewish lawyer, that already was not one strike, but 10 strikes against him. And most of
the judges were fierce Nazis. So, who would want a Jewish lawyer? And so I'm sure that
most of the non-Jewish clients must have left him. Of course, he may have picked up
some Jewish clients because from those Jewish lawyers who were disbarred, I don't know
how that evened out, but I'm fairly certain that his income must have declined after '33.
He had actually a very well going practice, he had, I remember he used to talk about one
of the most famous German movie actresses he represented in her divorce and then he
had some members of the Hohenzollern family, that was the family of the last German
Kaiser. In fact, the nephew of the Kaiser and his mother who was a sister-in-law of the
Kaiser, were his clients. And, in fact, they stuck with him until the end, that's very
interesting. But his, their cases did never involve court appearances, he drew up personal
wills for them and made property arrangements and advice and things like that, where he
didn't really appear in public for them.

Q: Let me ask you, Hitler came to power, can you kind of describe to me the progression
of events and regulations and policy that altered your life and your lifestyle.

A: In the beginning, I must say also one thing, is my parents, in retrospect, must have
made heroic efforts to insulate us children from all of these events. Initially, we didn't
notice anything, in fact, that is a little story that I didn't really plan to tell you, but I was,
in January of '33, I was 10 years old then and I had scarlet fever, it's a childhood disease
which doesn't exist anymore, but in those days kids had it. And our pediatrician who was
also a distant relative, it was still in the days of house calls, came every day and looked
me over, looked into my throat and so on, and he came at a certain time, in the morning at
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 11
some point. And it was sort of a regular routine, the bell would ring, my mother would
come into my room with him and then he would examine me. On one day, and now I
know it was the 30th of January, 1933, instead of coming in, my mother and he were
outside the door of my room, but with the door closed, and sort of in a low voice which I
couldn't understand, kept talking and talking and talking. And finally they came in and I
was very sort of disappointed, not only because of the change in routine, but somehow I
wasn't that important and they talked and then I asked them what's the matter, and my
mother said in a grave voice, Hitler has just been appointed Chancellor. And at that time,
it sort of went in here, out there, it didn't mean anything. I knew I was 10 years old, so I,
the German, there had been several elections before so the house walls and public places
were plastered with election placards and so I remember having seen, vote for Hitler and
vote for Tahlmann who was the Communist party leader, and vote for this man, and
Germany also had many parties. And, so vaguely the name Hitler rang a bell, but I had
no idea basically who he was, what he stood for and so on. Now, coming specifically to
your question, the first real change was that eviction from the Mommsen Gymnasium.
Before that, the laws, there were laws of course, as I said, about disbarring lawyers, didn't
affect me and, unfortunately, it did not affect my father either. Then there were many
other, there weren't too many laws, until '35, in'35 the so called Nuremberg laws were
passed which actually defined Jews as second class citizens, but that also had no
immediate effect, the main effect was also that Jews not only could not marry gentiles, I
mean, Aryan gentiles, but even the act of intercourse without being married was a
punishable offense, but obviously, I was 12, 13 years old then, that was the last thing on
my mind. And second class citizenship had, of course, trickled through and had many
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 12
other effects which at that point did not affect me. But, as I said, the eviction from the
school did and but also, our lifestyle never changed, I mean we went, my parents went on
their summer vacations and my sister and I went to our camps and we had, I mean we
were clothed, we had food to eat and, in fact, oh yeah, one big change also was that the
Nazis were totally obsessed with the idea that the Jews were sort of spoiling the German
race and most Jewish families, at least middle and upper middle classes, had maids and in
those days maids were usually live-in maids, and one of the outgrowths of the Nuremberg
laws was that any Jewish household which has a male, a Jewish male in the household,
was forbidden to have a German maid who is below 45 years of age. So, we had, I think
we had one at that time so we had to dismiss her and took an older woman. You could
take an older one, I mean it was all that obsession with that maybe a Jew would then
father an illegitimate child with such a maid. I don't know, maybe there were such cases,
but they were, it was almost a sickness with the Nazis. Anyway, I then started at the
Jewish school and I remember there were several kids besides myself in my grade who
started new there. Now, we were up to grade level in all the general subjects like math,
German and so on, but in the Jewish subjects, and particularly in Hebrew, our classmates
were already freely translating the Torah, the Tenach, the entire bible, from English, from
Hebrew into German, and I could barely sort of read stammeringly and so did the others.
So they instituted a sort of second track Hebrew for us assimilated kids; and for the first
class the principal, a Dr. Schlesinger came in to give us a little pep talk about the
importance of knowing Hebrew for Jewish children. And after he was finished, he said,
okay, tomorrow will be the first, now he dismissed us, tomorrow will be the first real
class and we are supposed to bring, he wrote on the board a certain grammar by so and so
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 13
which you could buy at some book store that he named, and a copy of the Chumash. And
as soon as he said that, my arm shot up and he pointed at me and I asked, what is a
Chumash. And that question completely floored that principal. He couldn't imagine a
Jewish boy asking, being so unbelievably ignorant that he wouldn't know what a
Chumash is. And so all he could, yeah and also, he was a short, very thin, wiry man with
a reddish goatee, bald head but a fringe of red hair around the back of his head and his
entire head, as I remember it, turned red just as his beard, he walked toward me and
finally, I guess he took some time to think about what to say, and then he said, you are a
Jew and you don't know what a Chumash is? And, of course, that question totally
demolished me and I sat down and felt as if I had said something. . .

End of side one of tape one.
Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997, tape one, side B.
A: Yeah, my immediate reaction was that I was totally embarrassed by the principal's
remark and, but soon, as a result of the very strong Jewish education which was part of
the curriculum in that school, I started to become more and more interested in that. The
name of the school, actually that is very important, was Adass Jisroel, it means Jewish
Congregation, a Jewish Community. And we came to the point even where I decided that
I wanted to become a rabbi when I grew up, which very much upset my father,
particularly. I started to go regularly to Shabbat services in. * * * Berlin had many
synagogues and, as I said before, there was only one congregation which ran all of the
synagogues in Berlin and also the rabbis, therefore, were not confined to one synagogue,
so one didn't have to put up with the same rabbi Shabbat after Shabbat the way it is here,
for example, in this country, where each congregation has its own rabbi, but instead, the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 14
rabbis circulated. But, obviously, Berlin is a big city and it was taken for granted that
they would take public transport to go to the various synagogues which were widely
scattered in different parts of the city. So, I particularly became very fond of two rabbis
who were both very dynamic and also gave me a lot of moral support in their sermons.
One was Dr. Max Nussbaum who later emigrated to this country and became rabbi in
Hollywood, California. And the other one was Dr. Manfred Swarsenski who came to this
country and actually founded a synagogue in Madison, Wisconsin. I never saw
Nussbaum again, but Swarsenski I visited in the mid-'60's when I went to a scientific
conference in Madison. I knew he was there so I contacted him before and we set up a
luncheon, we spent several hours together just talking and reminiscing. I, yeah, in that,
so the years went by from '35 to '38 and by 1938, I must have been about in 10th grade
and in October, 1938, the German police arrested all Jews who had Polish passports,
overnight, without any prior warning, in fact, they came in the early morning hours. And
put them on, into railroad cars which were all ready prepared beforehand and they were
shipped off to Poland and the only thing the German saw to it was that they had their
Polish passports with them because by International law, the Poles had to admit anyone
who had a valid Polish passport. And there were quite a number of kids from my class
affected by that and even a few teachers who didn't appear the next day.

Q: What were you thinking when all this was happening?

A: It was terrible, I mean, I still remember, I mean these kids, that was actually the first
fore taste of the later deportations. I mean, people just vanished overnight, the day before
nobody knew anything, they didn't know, we didn't know and on the next day, they just
didn't appear in school. Our Hebrew teacher was one of them and then several kids, one
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 15
of them, but that's beside the point here, I met again 30 years later in Israel where he is,
by now he must be retired, he was a professor of classical languages at Hebrew
University.

Q: What's surprising me about what you're telling me, is that you, what I'm
understanding here is that until 1938, your life went on pretty much the way it had before
except for that you changed schools? You haven't described any real hardships or laws or
regulations that affected you personally. Is that true?

A: That's true. I mean, that was my, I mean first of all, it's 50, 60 years later, what I
remember, but I think my memory is pretty good as far as that is concerned, that doesn't
mean that these regulations didn't exist, but they didn't really touch me personally and, as
I said, after I've read a lot of what happened in those days, and I see now that my parents
must have made a monumental effort to keep things away from us, that's the only
explanation I have. One thing that I noticed also maybe in my life, and that was that
earlier, I think in either late '37 or early '38, all Jewish stores were required to put the
names of their owners in letters of a prescribed size on the store window in, and not in an
artistic way, so in a way that identified the store as a Jewish store because no other store,
in white paint of a prescribed size, but again, we didn't have a store, I just noticed it, that
this is what was happening. Another thing that happened also, was that all Jews were
forced to adopt an additional middle name, males the name Israel and females the name
Sara. In this country there are many non-Jews, Jewish women, who are called Sarah, but
in Germany, the name Sarah is totally unknown, it was purely a Jewish name and Israel,
anyway, so, and also the law stipulated not only that we had to take those names, but that
we had to use it, particularly in all communications with government agencies or also
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 16
with commercial enterprises and so on. Like, I had to call myself Ernest Israel Fontheim,
written out. And my father had to do the same thing. It was, of course, also a
humiliation and in addition to that, it was a sort of signal for the recipient, this is a Jew
who is writing to me.

Q: Could you play in public parks, could you ride the busses?

A: Yeah.

Q: You could do all this?

A: Right, at that time there were no restrictions of any sort to our life, we could go to
movies, theaters, I could go to, now there were places which on their own initiative, had
posted signs, Jews, "Juden unerwiinscht", that means Jews are not desired here, actually
to translate it literally, but what it means really, Jews forbidden. That was already, there
were, for example, many benches on parks, because again the Nazis with their obsession
with sex, had that idea that maybe a German woman might sit on a park bench and then
some Jewish man might sit next to her and start to, some dirty business with her and so a
German woman cannot be expected to sit next to a Jew on a park bench. But whatever,
that started up and then, as I said, certain, maybe some restaurants, but we didn't go much
to restaurants anyway, so. ..

Q: Did you know about the book, that huge book burning earlier?

A: At that time, I don't remember it, I remember it, obviously having read about it, but
that happened I think in '33 or '34 and I was 10 or 11 years old and so. . .

Q: So your family insulated you to the extent that you weren't particularly distressed or
fearful?

A: That's correct, yeah.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 17
Q: Could you sense any change in your parents or relatives or friends?

A: Oh, yeah, I mean that I should mention. They were, there was a stream of people
who emigrated, you know, some uncle, some cousin, you know, and there was always
farewells and friends of mine, their parents emigrated and, of course, the kid then went
along. I should say I had a best friend in this Adass Jisroel school, he was a boy, a very
interesting boy, in fact, we became best friends initially because we both were new in that
class, but from totally different backgrounds. He came, his parents had moved from
Vienna to Berlin, they were Austrian Jews, but the parents were, of course, born before
World War I like all of our parents and before World War I, the Austro-Hungarian
Empire included southern Poland and particularly, most of Galicia, the province, and his
parents actually were orthodox Jews from Galicia who had, however, left there I think
before the war already and settled in Vienna and so they were then, by citizenship, they
were Austrian Jews and they came to Berlin, it might sound strange since Austria at that
time was still a democracy, but his father had some business, I think he sort of
administered buildings and as an Austrian, he was not subject, he was a foreigner, foreign
Jews were not subject to all these antisemitic laws. So we, and in fact, this friend also
influenced me in that, and I took him also to services to a liberal synagogue with the
organ and he found that very impressive and so we influenced each other. And we stuck
together, he was a very bright boy and on the 13th of March, 1938, that was the day
Hitler marched into Austria, I'll never forget that. I visited him, I saw his father sit in the
dining room with his head in his hands like that and crying because he knew that his
game was up now, now he was also a German and subject to all the laws. And to see a
father cry is an incredibly powerful experience for and also a devastating experience for a
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 18
boy. Totally devastating. And then the parents finally decided to send their boy out to
England, you may know, England had relatively liberal immigration for Jewish children
and they, they were of course orthodox, and they enrolled him in a Yeshiva in Scotland
and ostensibly for him to become a rabbi which he never did, but that was the rules under
which he could get out and into England. And that was actually the first personal blow in
my life. And also for that reason, I never forgot the date, it was January 18, 1938. And I
was at the railroad station together with his parents, of course, to say goodbye and he was
my best friend and I lost him. But, of course, the year 1938 then had many other, all of
those things happening, I mentioned the arrest and deportation of the Polish Jews and
then just a few weeks later, two or three weeks later, came the infamous Kristallnacht
Pogrom. Of course, the two events were not unrelated. Among the people who were
arbitrarily arrested and shipped to Poland was an elderly couple, Grynszpan, who, and the
Poles, of course, claimed they didn't know what to do with all those Jews, so they put
them into camps in inhuman conditions and they had lived in Germany, I'm not sure
whether in Berlin or some other city, anyway, they had a son, Herschel, whom they had
sent to Paris to relatives because it became, Berlin became too oppressive, and he lived
with an uncle in Paris. And when the parents wrote to him a letter of desperation and he
became so furious he obtained a gun and decided to assassinate the German ambassador
to Paris, but you know, if a 16 year old boy enters an embassy and says he wants to talk
to the ambassador, that's not whom he's going to see, obviously, and so they ushered him
into some underling from, a consular secretary or something, his name was Ernst vom
Rath, and history probably would never know him if it hadn't been for Grynszpan to pull
his pistol and assassinate him there. And the German government, on the other hand,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 19
used that as a pretext to stage these pogroms and that was starting the night, from
November 9th to 10th, for several days. I mean, synagogues were burned, Jewish shops
and now, of course, you see, since the Jewish shops all had to be labeled with the names
of the owner, it never said Jewish shop, but it was known that the stores which had the
name of the owner in this particular prescribed way, these were the Jewish stores so it
was clear for the mob which windows to smash and loot.

Q: What were you doing during the time of Kristallnacht, what did you see?

A: Yeah, on that day in the morning, where we lived there were, at least on my way to
the station, I had to take a commuter train to the city, to that school, I didn't pass any
shops, they were all just apartment houses, so I knew nothing. That was the morning of
the 10th, now, it was a Thursday. So I took the train and I went to school and as soon as I
was in the school, I realized what was on, first of all, many kids weren't there and those
who were there told horror stories of passing shops that had been smashed and looted.
And then the next thing that was unusual is, as you know, the school day starts at eight
sharp, the bell is ringing and then the normal thing would be that the teacher would
appear at the crack of the bell, no teacher not just in our class, but in the neighboring, in
no class any teacher was to be seen. And after some time, I don't remember it was a half
an hour, whatever, all the teachers came from the teacher's conference room with the
following instructions, that there was unrest all over Berlin and the safety of the school
cannot be guaranteed and furthermore, we should go home but we should go home alone,
if we go in groups that might attract mobs and just a single boy, you know, can sort of
slip under, unrecognized and also we should not go to friends because our parents might
get worried, we should only go the shortest way and fastest way home so the parents
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 20
know we are safe, and there won't be any school for the time being, we will be notified
when the school will start up again.

Q: So you went home?

A: Yes. The commuter train was an elevated train and it passed by the synagogue where
I had my bar mitzvah and what I saw there was really one of the worst horror shocks in
my life. It was a beautiful building with huge, three huge domes, sort of in Moorish style
and from the center dome came a huge thick column of smoke. When I saw that I
became so obsessed that I forgot the warning that was given to us to go straight home. At
the next train stop I left the train and I raced back to the building, to the synagogue and
what I saw there is there was a mob of people across the street, held back by a police line
and the fire department was there hosing down adjacent buildings so to prevent the
flames from doing damage to German property and no hose was directed at the
synagogue and that, I just stood there, I was totally sort of hypnotized. That was
something; I couldn't even imagine that something like that could happen. And then,
there were many antisemitic sort of shouts from the mob, I mean like, I don't know, throw
out the Jews or kill the Jews and it never occurred to me that I was one in the middle of
that mob. And then suddenly somebody said that in the house where, against which the
mob was sort of standing looking at the synagogue, on the ground floor somebody knew
there was a Jew living. So there were immediate shouts, let's get them. And then the
mob turned its back to the synagogue and burst into the house itself and then I heard sort
of heavy blows against the apartment door and I was way outside, I couldn't see what was
happening there. And all I could think was, I hope that the door is going to hold and I
remember that was sort of as if I was trying to influence the door to hold, but of course, it
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 21
didn't and I could hear sort of splintering wood and then after that there was total silence,
it lasted for minutes, not a sound. And then I heard again shouts like, get them, get them,
and then there was an elderly man, all I remember seeing, he had a huge bald head, he
was probably sixty, or I don't know how old he was, and then from all sides there were
blows and his face soon was completely bloodied. And suddenly there was a young man
who shouted, you cowards, so many all fighting against one single guy. And then some
others tried to attack that man and sort of pushed him away. And then once he was
pushed through the crowd, there was police already waiting in a car as if this was all
staged, I have no idea and he was pushed off into the car and the police drove him off.
And after I saw that, I turned around and went back to the train and went home. So the
year 1938 was really for me, it was a big turning point. It started out with the emigration
of my best friend which was a tremendous personal loss for me, then the arrest of the
Polish Jews, who I also knew quite a number including some of my teachers and then the
Kristallnacht. So I stayed home as we were told on Friday. And on Saturday one of my
friends had a birthday party that already was long planned and so I went to it, and we had
hardly come there when somebody, I think one of the boys came in saying that his father
had just been arrested by the Gestapo and that the Gestapo is arresting the Jewish men.
So the party never took place, we all immediately raced, in those days, Saturday was a
weekday, so my father was in his office and actually it was not too far, it was several
blocks from where the birthday party was supposed to take place. So I raced to his office
and just when I came in, he said he had just received an urgent telephone call from a
colleague, a German, an Aryan colleague to see him immediately on an important matter
and he asked me to come along. I was at that time 16 years old and so we went, that
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 22
colleague was two blocks from my father's office and was a certain Dr. Kiilz. He was a
few years somewhat younger than my father and his father, Dr. Kiilz's father, had also
himself been a lawyer, but more importantly, he had been Minister of the Interior in one
of the pre-Hitler governments of the Weimar Republic and in Germany, like I think in
many European countries, the police is within the Interior Ministry sort of an agency, I
mean like somewhat comparable to the FBI here, which is in the Justice Department. But
there the police, the entire police organization, is national, it's not local like in this
country. And anyway, the father still had close contacts to high police officials and had
learned, therefore, of this action against, for the arrest of Jewish men and in those days,
also, everybody was paranoiac, partly with justification, that the Gestapo was listening on
telephone calls, so therefore, the son who my father actually knew the son better than the
father, who had, I think, done legal cases together with him, and the son did not say
anything over the phone, just told my father to see him in his office on an important
matter. And my father then was ushered in and asked me to stay outside in the waiting
room and they were quite a time together there and then they came out again and my
father told me that that lawyer had warned him not to go back to his office or, of course,
not to his own apartment and to, it is safe, however, to stay at places where there are no
Jewish males. Fortunately, my father's sister, who was a widow and she had three
children, two daughters and a son. One daughter had already emigrated to Argentina, and
the son had just left a few months or so before Kristallnacht also for Argentina. So it was
Just his sister and the remaining daughter. So in other words, there were no males in that
household. So my father immediately went there, and the Gestapo came both to our
apartment and also to the office to inquire and, of course, we told them he left and didn't
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 23
tell us where he was going, and in those days the Gestapo still took these relatively stupid
excuses and just reappeared a few random times maybe hoping to catch him, but didn't,
and that was the second great stroke of luck that my father had after having been
permitted to practice law. The thing was that the Gestapo immediately let it be known
that those Jews who were arrested were put into concentration camps, with the Berlin
Jews mainly in the camp Sachsenhausen which is north of Berlin. And the treatment, of
course, was horrible, full of sadism and physical brutality. However, in those days at
least there was no killing, no mass killings, I think a few Jews actually did die due to just
mistreatment, but I mean which is horrible enough in its own right, but at least most
survived and the Gestapo let it be known that anyone whose family can produce an
emigration visa to another country will be immediately released and will have to leave
the country within one month, giving him one month's time to wind up affairs and so on.
So, but as I said, my father was lucky, he was warned, he was never arrested and, of
course, the Jewish relief organizations from the Joint here in America to the local ones in
Germany, now put high pressure on and the first priority to get those Jews immigration
visas to somewhere, anywhere in the world, just to get them out, I mean those who were
in concentration camps, to save their lives, to get them out.

Q: Was there a strong Nazi presence in the streets, 1 mean were there marches, were
there Gestapo?

A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean that is, no Gestapo, by its very nature is a secret police, they
were in civilian and they were, I mean not conspicuous, even though they themselves
were everywhere and they had a whole army of informers who were not actually Gestapo
but reported to them. And that was a network, throughout Germany, maybe I neglected
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 24
to say that, that belongs much earlier. As soon as Hitler assumed power, there were
frequent marches by the SA on, they had a fascination with marches, as I said, this
Mommsen Gymnasium, after that Nazi officer took over, one of the things he introduced,
as I explained, was during the lunch hour, after eating lunch, we always marched around
the street singing songs. But the SA, at every, whatever occasion or even no occasion,
they would march around and one of their favorite songs, incidentally, was

"Und wenn das Judenblut vom Messer spritzt, dann geht's nochmal so gut."

which translated means, if Jewish blood squirts from the knives then things will go quite
as well. I mean, to sing a song like that, I mean I listened to it even at that time, but the
older I get, the more incredible it seems to me that somebody, I mean even who hates
some group, to make that into a song is so unbelievable that it defies description.
Another song which was a favorite was, I'll say it in German first,

"Wir werden weiter marschieren,

auch wenn alles in Scherben fallt,

denn heute gehort uns Deutschland

und morgen die ganze Welt."

that means, we will continue to march and even if everything breaks down and falls into
pieces, because today Germany belongs to us and tomorrow the entire world. And so,
and they had all kinds of other songs, obviously, I mean these are the things that I never
forgot.

Q: So even if you were insulated, this had to be fairly alarming.

A: Yeah, I mean I found it, I mean there were other things that were alarming also.
There was a weekly newspaper called Der Stiirmer, the storm trooper, maybe you've
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 25
heard of it. It was published by the Nazi governor of the province of Franconia, a man
named Julius Streicher, and which was full of antisemitic articles and also totally fixated
on the sexual aspect of antisemitism. The paper, I mean apparently calling to that Jews
had infinite sexual appetites and particularly for little innocent blond German girls to
seduce them, that was somehow a Jewish command to do that, I mean it was just
incredible, I mean the man must have been sick himself, or whoever wrote these stories.
And, of course, sometimes they were true. They would intermix it with some true stories,
where sometimes a Jew was convicted of some crime. Usually the crimes Jews were
convicted of were such things as smuggling money out. In Germany foreign exchange
was strictly controlled, because the whole economy was managed and controlled, but you
know Jews, rather than letting the Nazis take it all away from them, sometimes tried to
smuggle some money out and in some cases they succeeded and in other cases they were
caught, and that was always touted as a big crime against the German nation. And of
course, the story always was that the Jew, they came with nothing and now they are rich,
so that is all just taken away from the Germans. And stories like that, and then of course,
there were also true stories of where a Jew somehow was caught having had a
relationship with a non-Jewish girl and if that happened, then the Jew usually came to a
concentration camp and those Jews who were there for, there was actually a term, a
German term for that, which translated means sort of defilement of the race. And they
were mercilessly tortured and punished and usually, if they weren't shot outright, just
died of torture. So that newspaper was not just sold at newsstands, but they had sort of
display cases on various strategic points, like in busy railroad stations and so on. And
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 26
usually I ignored it, but sometimes I sort of went there and read it and somehow I did not
relate it to me, it's a funny thing.

End of tape one

Tape 2

Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997. The interviewer is
Randy Goldman, this is tape two, side A.
A: What I, what affected me actually more than these vicious articles in the Stiirmer,
were antisemitic articles in the general press and I also felt at that time and still feel
today, that they probably were much more effective in influencing people than the
Stiirmer articles because the articles in the Stiirmer, most of them at least, were so
outlandish that, and also they were always accompanied by horrible caricatures where a
Jew looked like a, maybe a mixture of a gorilla and a human being and totally distorted,
that I am sure many people just couldn't take it seriously, on the other hand, that
antisemitic articles in the general press, which were more sort of subdued and not as
outwardly ridiculous, and therefore, also probably appeared more reasonable, probably
influenced many more people toward increased antisemitism. And they were, for
example, I have to admit that to some extent, even I was influenced by the constant
refrain of the German press was that the Jews were in charge of all the countries that
were fighting against Germany, particularly of course, the United States, and there was a
whole succession of names that always appeared, one was that, of course, of Felix
Frankfurter, the supreme court justice, another one was Herbert Lehman, the governor of
the state of New York, I remember, and there were one or two others. Oh, yeah, of
course, Bernard Baruch, the financier and they made it appear as if they are, these people
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 27
were sort of behind the scenes manipulating and, of course, Roosevelt himself, whose
name was often distorted as Rosenfeld, implying that if he wasn't a Jew at least he was of
Jewish descent. And after the war, particularly after meeting American soldiers, and
many of them Jewish, I was surprised actually to hear that there was large scale
antisemitism in this country and that the influence of these Jews was a relatively minimal.
Oh, I forgot one name, of course, that was Henry Morgenthau, the Secretary of the
Treasury at that time. He was probably, I would say, from what I can judge reading
history, the most influential, in the government at least, of the United States and I think
he was fairly close to President Roosevelt. But it was nothing like that and as the Nazis,
and I was, I have to admit now, disappointed because somehow that part of the Nazi
propaganda I had started to believe somewhat. And then, by the way, the same thing in
the Soviet Union, you know, there were lots of Jewish names, many of these were
actually exterminated by Stalin himself, and particularly, many of the original
revolutionaries, and starting with Trotsky, of course. And there too, actually, the fact that
there was wide spread antisemitism in the Soviet Union, never made it into the German
papers, it wouldn't have fit their purposes. Okay, now, the Kristallnacht was not only a,
just devastating horrible event in my personal life as well as the lives of all Jews in
Germany, but it represented a watershed because that was followed by a avalanche of
new laws and regulations totally restricting Jews. What affected us first of all was that
the remaining Jewish lawyers were now disbarred. So suddenly my father was not only
living in an antisemitic hotbed like Germany, but on top of it, he was unemployed here
and my parents made, then from then on really, desperate efforts to get out of the country.
And, but it was, by that time everybody had woken up and I remember once standing in
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 28
front of the British Consulate in Berlin which was in the embassy compound, arriving
there at six in the morning, just to get some form to fill out and I think by eleven or
twelve or so, finally it was my turn to receive those forms. I don't know what ever
happened, but I don't think, but obviously they didn't go to England and neither did I, so I
stood there for nothing. And then, also, that was followed by laws making it illegal for a
Jew to visit any place of amusement or entertainment or general culture, that included the
whole spectrum, I mean from theater, symphony, opera to circuses, county fairs kind of
thing, you name it. Also, public beaches, swimming, public swimming pools, movie
theaters, public parks even. Parks were much more popular in Germany than they are
here because most people in this country, or at least a high proportion, live in their own
homes and have their own gardens, in Germany the vast majority, at least at that time,
lived in apartments and so parks were visited by people just regularly, just for recreation,
just like people here might just sit in their back yard. Anyway, they were now outlawed
for Jews. I, from the beginning, I and all of my friends, totally ignored the, that law and
we just kept going. I remember one rather humorous incident, in the summer of 1940,
the Rome State Opera from Rome, Italy, gave a one week guest appearance at the Berlin
State Opera and I had been an opera fan and on the day when the ticket sales started for
the Rome Opera, obviously everybody knew you had to be there early, so I was there, I
think, at five in the morning or so, and there was already a long line, and while you stand
in line, of course, for hours, sort of trotting from left leg to right leg and vice versa, you
start also with people around you to get acquainted and talk and so on and the advantage
of that was that you could then ask somebody to hold your place while you, it's just easier
to take a little walk than to stand at the same spot, so I did that also. And while I then
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 29
took my walk, I walked along the line and I saw three other boys from my Jewish high
school classroom and it was sort of an unwritten law, you know, one Jew might get away,
two Jews is already like a synagogue, so we just waved at each other with a grin, without
really getting together. And most people I knew did that, but there was a danger. I
mean, if the Gestapo caught somebody, I mean the least thing was a concentration camp,
but as a young person, first of all, I was always sort of defying authority and plus, a
young person is always more reckless than an older one. Yeah, let me, actually, in my
personal life, what happened then, finally the schools were permitted to operate again
and, but then, shortly, that was probably late '38, that date I don't quite remember any
more precisely, but then in early '39, most Jewish schools were closed by the Gestapo,
including the Adass Jisroel school, to which I was going. And there was only one Jewish
high school left operating and that was the official high school of the Jewish community
of Berlin, but by that time, my parents were really in high gear trying to emigrate and
they had the idea that it would be good for me to go to the American School in Berlin.
The American School in Berlin, also it was very close to where we lived, it was run by an
American principal and it mainly served children of diplomats, I mean not just
Americans, obviously, but also British and others who would know English, and also
children of businessmen who were stationed in Berlin. And therefore, the tuition was, of
course, very high and I remember that was the first time sort of I heard about that this
was a sort of a big sacrifice for my parents to put me in that school, and actually, I was
scared because I would be thrown suddenly into a totally English environment, I mean,
the teachers were all Americans, some maybe British, actually, and English was the
language. Most kids had English as their native tongue and I had had three years of
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 30
English at the Adass school. But fortunately, things turned out to be not quite as bad. It
turned out the school followed the curriculum of sort of the basic American school
system and the German gymnasium was really a much more rigorous and elitist school
and was at least a year if not more ahead of it, so many of the things, for example, in
Latin and biology, I remember, we had had already much earlier, so the material itself
was often, just for me, a review of things I had learned earlier and, therefore, that made it
easier for me to concentrate on the language. I think I made quite a bit of progress there,
I don't know exactly how long I was, I wasn't there very long, probably from about
February, March '39, until the start of the summer term, which was, I think, May or June
'39. In '39 also, was a lot, the first summer in my life where my parents didn't send me to
a summer camp. And on the first of September, 1939, of course the German Wehrmacht
entered Poland, attacked Poland, and I still, I listened to Hitler's speech to the Reichstag
in which he explained his rationale and I never forget the words which he said, "since
five o'clock this morning, we are shooting back", I mean the fairy tale that the Nazis told
the world was that Poland had attacked Germany and that had been going on already for
days and weeks, and while he patiently sort of tried to look the other way and tried to
come to a peaceful solution and finally he is not taking it anymore and they are shooting
back. I mean, it's unbelievable. Okay, anyway, that was a Friday, September 1, and I
should say actually two days before, on August 30, that was my father's birthday, 1939,
must have been his 57th birthday, and at that time already everything was much more
subdued and we didn't have a party at home. We just went out to some nice restaurant
downtown. And while we were sitting there, suddenly a newsboy came in with stacks of
news, extra editions, shouting extra, extra, you know, and every table bought a paper and
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 31
the big fat headline was, general mobilization in Poland. And so, everybody knew
already, see and in Germany, general mobilization was never officially announced
because the Nazis had already quietly mobilized and then on the first, as I said, Germany
attacked Poland, it was a Friday. On Sunday the 3rd, we took our customary Sunday
excursion, we walked through the forest near where we lived to one of the cafes at the
riverbank of the Havel River and at that time also, most if not all of the restaurants in
Germany were sort of wired for public address systems. And while we were sitting there,
it was early afternoon I think, the public address system went on with an important
announcement from the German government, and it said that the British Ambassador had,
at 11:00, I still remember the time, submitted a diplomatic note saying that, requesting
that German troops be taken back to the original German-Polish border within a certain
number of hours. If Germany refused to do that, then Britain in line with its treaty
obligations to Poland, will consider itself at war with Germany. And the French
Ambassador had submitted a similar note also. As we were sitting there, I remember that
my father broke out into tears and that was the first time that I saw him cry. And he said,
this is the Second World War in his lifetime and that he was not going to survive it.

What prompted that remark, I never, it was the Holocaust was still so far away as to be
unbelievable, but obviously, he must have sensed something. And then we went home.
And then the outbreak of the war was followed then by many more restrictions. One was
we had to turn in our telephones, we had to turn in all appliances, of course in those days,
people had much fewer than today, but still I mean that included such things as vacuum
cleaners, phonograph players, I don't know what else one had in those days, it was before
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 32
washing machines and dishwashers, but whatever one had, it had to be turned in. And in
addition to. ..

Q: Radios?

A: Oh, yeah, radio, yeah, I think radios, too, yeah, right. And then some, up to that time
I think Jews religiously obeyed all these things, and that was the first time where people
started to sort of balk and not everything was turned in. I knew of many cases where
people didn't turn in everything. Also, jewelry, valuables, you know, gold, silver,
diamonds, things like that, had to be all turned in. And it was just turned in for a receipt,
in other words, there was not thought of even to, for the government to buy it, it was just
stolen. And of course, one victim of the outbreak of the war was the American School in
Berlin which did not reopen because even though America itself at that time was not yet
in the war, but Germany was in the war and Germany was considered a war zone, there
was the possibility of air raids and so on, so anyway, the school didn't reopen. And then
at that point, I wanted to go back and do my high school graduation so I went back to the
high school of the Jewish community and graduated there in March, 1940. There's a big
difference between a high school graduation in Germany, or I think in any European
country, and also England, and that in America. In America, it is simply sort of an
automatic thing, after completing 12 years, 12th grade of school you graduate. They had
a rigorous examination, I still remember it was a fearful thing and I studied day and night
and, I mean, passed it of course, but it was, it ranks in my memory together with my
Ph.D. prelims, I mean each one at their own level. Also, it's a state administered exam,
so they, from the state education authority, a sort of high official appeared there. Yeah,
and the way the graduation sort of examination goes, was the following. There was first
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 33
a set of written examinations, each three hours long, one was a German composition,
which incidentally, we had several essay topics to choose from. And the topic I chose
was the discussion and evaluation of the work of a leading personality of modern times,
and I chose Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. And later on my father
chided me for it and said, since that will be read by a German examination commission
that was a mistake that I did that, it might harm me and I said, well, the people know who
Iam, I am a Jew and they know that, that's a Jewish school, so anyway, my father was
always very concerned with such things. And actually, I got a very good grade for that.
And mathematics and so on and that takes place over a period of about a month, these
various exams, spaced. And then after that, about I think, after the last exam, maybe two
or three weeks, comes the oral. And the German examiners, I mean, they get all the
written tests and then one of them appears for the final oral examination. And the oral
examination was handled in such a way that the examination commission which
consisted of all the teachers that we had in 12th grade, the school principal and the
German official were sitting in the examination room and we were called in one by one,
we were 14, 13 or 14, I forgot, I think 13, we were called in. And before that started, we
were all called in together and the German official made a little speech and he was a tall
good-looking guy, with a white thick mane of hair, and such a huge swastika party
member button here. And, which didn't particular make us, or at least me, feel easy. And
he, I don't know, he said a few things, but then he went on to say that he has read so far
our written examinations and he wanted to make us a compliment, he said they are far
above the average of what he has seen and he wanted to particularly compliment us
because he is aware of the difficult circumstances under which we are living. And then
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 34
he dismissed us and that man was obviously, you know, he must have been a holdover
from the Weimar Republic, he was old enough anyway for that, and many of these guys
were pressured into joining the party or losing their job, and so they all, not all I guess,
but many, compromised and joined the party, but that man obviously, to have said that,
took already courage. So, anyway, that was the examination and then after that, I was,
anyway very Zionist inclined, so I volunteered for one of the preparatory camps for
emigration to Israel, or Palestine in those days. And there was, they were named by the
Hebrew name Hachsharah means preparation. And, but I discovered that I was totally
unsuited for communal living, I felt totally unhappy. I mean, the living there was sort of
to simulate kibbutz style living, you know, and I was constantly homesick and didn't like
it at all. And then for me, fortunately actually, that camp was dissolved for some reason
and people were distributed partly to other camps and partly to a work camp in a suburb
of Berlin and that's where I was put and that was in a southern suburb of Berlin and we
were just a small group of boys, there wasn't more than 10, detailed to work in a forest
which was managed by a forestry official to cut down certain trees that were diseased.
And I still remember that must have been the healthiest time of my life. It was by that
time, midsummer of 1940, and we were working all bare-chested, just some shorts on and
sawing down, that was in the days before chain saws and all that, I mean it was really
hand sawing, these long band saws where one man grabs the handle at one end and the
other on the other and you go back and forth. And then after the tree has been felled,
then with an ax all the branches had to be cut, apparently they were diseased, but still
could be used for some purpose, because we had to hack off with axes all of the branches
and then with a special peeler, peel the bark off so that just the bare trunk remained. And
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 35
the local forester was sort of a fairly decent guy, I mean he got us as Jews, oh yeah, I
should have said that with the outbreak of World War II, of course, immediately food
was rationed. And not only food, also clothing, everything, shoes, everything you can
think of, all consumer goods were rationed. And Jews from the beginning, got less than
the, the ration system was a three tiered system, the lowest was called the general
consumer and then a higher, the next step up was workers cards, these are for like factory
workers, they got certain items more like I think fat, milk, maybe meat, I don't know.
And then the highest category was heavy labor, these were people like construction,
miners, you know, in the coal mines, this sort of thing. But, first of all, Jews were not
entitled to any worker's cards even if they did do some work where Germans would have
received them. And then our rations were actually shortened even compared to the
general consumer. But the forester there, since he wanted also to get work out of us and
he knew you know hungry people are not as strong, so he got actually through the local
Nazi "Bauern" or farmer leader, peasant leader, whatever, extra rations for us of farmers
bread and sausages which were actually delicious. And we were sort of a really nice little
community there and I spent the summer there and occasionally we had furloughs where
I could go into the city to visit my parents and so that was over, | think, in the fall of
1940. And then my parents still hoping that maybe something will come of the
emigration attempts, my parents did all kinds of things that I never really was aware of
fully. And there was, in Berlin, a mechanics school from ORT, O-R-T, you know that
exists still today in many countries, and they had a school sort of for mechanics and
machine working and so I started there sometime in the fall of 1940, and by that time,
however, already the Germans started to draft Jews into factories, namely to replace
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 36
German workers who had been drafted into the Army, to the Wermacht. But, my parents
were lucky, they somehow they were able to produce doctor's certificates so to exempt
them from the "Arbeitseinsatz", that means forced labor, basically. And I was exempted
because I worked in that mechanics school.

Q: Ijust want to ask you a couple of questions here. What was your sister doing
throughout all of this, was she just at home with your parents?

A: No, yeah, actually, it must have been telepathy, I just thought of my sister. She went,
first of all, when she went to school, initially she started in the German public school, but
was then transferred by my parents to a Jewish school, but a much less religious Jewish
private school and when all of these schools were dissolved in early '39, just like the
school I was in, she was transferred to another school, a Jewish school of the Jewish
community. And then there she was until, but that came later, I think in '41, all schooling
for Jewish children was simply outlawed by the Gestapo. But until then, she went to
school and had her friends, in fact, she had already a little boy friend.

Q: Your sister was a little bit younger, so at that point when schools were outlawed, were
there underground schools or people just stopped going?

A: When schooling was forbidden, no I think first of all, she was sent also to the country
for, there was, some young Jewish kids were sent to help in harvesting, you know, things
in the country. And then when she came back from there, the deportations were already
going strong.

Q: And your parents, were they supportive of your going to these little Zionist camps?
A: Yeah. They were supportive, but that time they wanted to get me out, in fact, we
already applied for a passport and, in fact, that is one also incident I remember where we
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 37
went, the passport office was actually part of the Jewish emigration office, which was
headed by Adolf Eichmann, and we applied there for a passport for me and for someone
here to come along, probably because I was a minor or something. And while we were
standing in line, I mean you went sort of from one position to the next filling out forms
and answering questions or whatever, while we were standing in line two very tall and
very good looking SS officers sort of walked across the waiting room where people are
standing in line, and for some reason, one of them just got pulled to my father for some
reason, and walked towards him and asked him why we were waiting there and my father
answered that this is my son and he is preparing to emigrate to Palestine and then he said,
oh, and then he answered, he asked my father, is he going with the Hechalutz? And sort
of in perfect Hebrew, and my father said, yes and then he just turned around and walked
away. And I don't, my father didn't seem nervous and so on, but I'm sure he must have
been extremely, you know, that guy was, he looked very aggressive and I mean like the
image of an SS officer. Anyway, so in fact, that passport I still have, part of my
cherished memories, with a big J which after the war I found out, we actually owe the
Swiss more than the Germans. Did you ever read about that? That the Swiss pressured
the Germans to put the J because Germany and Switzerland had a treaty for tourist visas,
not to need visas for tourism, but that apparently Jews discovered and went there as
tourists with their German passports, but then didn't leave. And the Swiss didn't like that
and so they told the Germans to do something, put a J in or whatever so that they can
immediately recognize the passport of a Jew and then they can refuse them. These nice,
neutral Swiss. Yeah, anyway, coming back, where was I? Oh, yeah, I went to ORT to
learn mechanics. And actually that turned out to be one of the more useful things I
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 38
learned in my life, probably more useful than Latin or, I don't know, but anyway, I
learned how to operate a lathe, although that I have never done later, and operate various
tools. And, as I said, at that time also they started to draft Jews, and on April 30, 1941,
also, oh no, I'm sorry, I have to back up there. I want to say that in February of 1941, we
received a notice that we have to vacate the huge apartment that we still occupied on the
Kaiserdamm. That was one of the major boulevards of Berlin, within a few days. That
was an action that was actually originated by Albert Speer who was a German armaments
minister and also in charge of construction in Berlin and he always tried after the war to
sort of pretend that he was just a professional and did his thing for the armaments, but
had nothing to do whatsoever with persecution of Jews or other minorities. Which is a
big lie, I mean that was one of the things which he did, to kick Jews out of their
apartments and Jews who were kicked out in this way, had to move in then, were
restricted to move into so called Jew houses. These were apartment buildings where at
least 50% of the tenants were already Jews and then also, you couldn't by any means, of
course, displace a German family in such a house. But you had to move into sort of a
sublet, into an apartment already inhabited by another Jewish family. And that was a big
blow, that was a huge, we had a huge apartment, of course, I never had mentioned that so
far. But it was an eight room apartment and there were many art pieces in there that my
parents had collected, of course, in better times, many oriental rugs and I did mention the
big library that my father had. And so, I mean just to, and of course, if I think today for
example, if we had to move out of our house, which I think in square footage may be
smaller than that apartment, that would be a nightmare within a few days. You know,
you accumulate so many things, personal things, documents, whatever, pictures, and but
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 39
in addition to that, a new apartment had to be found, a new room or rooms in another
apartment. Anyway, to make a long story short, we thought we had an ideal solution,
moving into the apartment of an uncle of my mother. Now, he was, the man was the
brother of my maternal grandfather and his wife and it was a much smaller apartment,
and they were living there and they had a son in the mid or late 30's and then two single
women were already living there also who had been kicked out somewhere else.

End of side one of tape two.
Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim, March 12, 1997, tape two, side B.
A: Of course, we were not the only family living under such circumstances, it was
throughout the Jewish community that Jews were cramped together. That, I guess, was
the equivalent of a ghetto, in Berlin it would have been impossible for the Nazis to sort of
institute a real ghetto in an area where only Jews lived because Jews never were
concentrated in one area to such an extent, so they would have had basically to clear
some area of non-Jewish Germans and anyway that would have been too disruptive. So,
instead, they crammed then the remaining Jews at that time simply into a much smaller
number of apartment buildings. That immediately led to innumerable conflicts. First of
all, I think I indicated before, that food was rationed and so it was very important for each
family to keep its food supply identified and separate and there were frequent suspicions
and some even, sometimes even accusations that somebody else ate somebody else's
sausage or at least part of it or that something was missing that should have not been
missing. And, in fact, the kitchen became known throughout the community as the
battlefield of the apartment. Because it wasn't just the problem of keeping the food
supplies separate, then there was a problem even of preparing dinner for example.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 40
Usually people eat more or less at the same time and they don't eat dinner at four when
nobody needed the kitchen. And so there was a source of friction in that respect. And of
course, with clean up and this was particularly, these things all might seem to be petty,
but at that time, the nerves of all or most Jews at least, were so frayed already by years of
oppression and innumerable Nazi anti-Jewish measures, that it never took much for
people to fly into a rage and to, that was really actually a very tragic outcome of that, but
that's what happened in many families, it happened in ours. The fact that we lived with
relatives had absolutely nothing to do with it and I think my mother and her aunt became
fierce enemies while we lived there. I would like just to back up briefly to a somewhat
earlier time when we were still in the apartment, in the big apartment on the Kaiserdamm
Boulevard. When I mentioned that after the outbreak of the war, the telephones were
taken away from Jews, a few days after that measure was instituted, our doorbell rang
and when we opened the door, the man who lived in the apartment upstairs above us was
at the door, he was a wealthy bachelor, middle aged, I have no idea, but the way I
remember him, he was probably then around 50, and he asked to talk to my father in
private under four eyes. So my father and he went into my father's study, and they spent
some time there, and we were all puzzled because there had never been really any social
or any other contact with him. And then after, I don't know, some minutes he
re-emerged, and they were both, both gentlemen were chatting sort of pleasantly, and our
upstairs neighbor said goodbye and left. And my father then turned to us with total
surprise on his face, saying that Mr. Kopf, that was his name, just offered that we could
use his telephone, he just heard that our phone was taken away and he felt that was
terrible, and if we had the need to call somebody, we should feel free and not only that,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 41
but he even gave us permission to pass his number on to a few, but absolutely reliable,
people who may have a need to call us, in that case he would send his maid down and
someone could come up and answer the call. And that was, in those days and under those
circumstances, was extraordinary because the man surely risked, particularly in the
second part of the offer. So there were sometimes such cases also. Another thing that I
wanted to mention is that in the same building, on the first floor, the Ambassador of a
small Central American country was living. I'm not 100% certain any more, but I'm
fairly sure that it was Costa Rica, I can't swear it, anyway, my parents when the situation
became worse and worse, particularly after Kristallnacht, my parents decided maybe an
approach to that man might be helpful in opening some doors, and although we barely
knew him except you know when we crossed paths on the stairs or so on, my father made
an appointment and went to see him and all I know is that nothing ever came of it. Okay,
back now to February, 1941, after our eviction from the big apartment and our move into
that much smaller apartment. That, yeah, that was in February of 1941. Two months
later, in April, precisely on April 30, 1941, the apprentice workshop of ORT, where I was
apprenticing for sort of mechanic and machine shop work, was ordered closed by the
Gestapo, and all students in there were supposed to report to the labor office. The Nazis,
incidentally, had instituted a special labor office for Jews shortly after the outbreak of the
war, whose task it was to deal with Jews exclusively and to give them, give Jews jobs
mainly in the defense industry or also in other sort of generally considered unpleasant
work, like for example, the city garbage department, garbage pickup and similar things,
and also they ride the railroads, certain unpleasant jobs in connection with the railroads
on tracks and so on. Many Jews had already been drafted to work, my parents succeeded
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 42
in getting exemptions by doctors, by getting certificates from doctors, I mean neither one
of them really was very healthy by that time any more. And, now for our advantage was,
I mean our, meaning the students, the apprentices at the ORT school, that we were
considered to be sort of already trained mechanics and, therefore, could get some better
jobs and all of us wound up at one of the Siemens factories. Now before the war, the
central Siemens factory was in Berlin, although they did have factories in other parts of
Germany, but in Berlin was the central factory, and also the central administration
building of Siemens was in Berlin, and it was a huge complex, it took, it was many
square miles large, fenced in of course, many, many buildings manufacturing all kinds of
things. In general, Siemens is an electrical equipment manufacturer along the same lines
as General Electric maybe, at least used to be, before they started building such things as
jet engines. Of course, they were entirely into war production at that time and one day
after our, after the ORT school was dismissed, we already, we had to report to this labor
office and there we were given, you know, pieces of paper telling us where to report the
next day and at what time and so on and so that's how I wound up at Siemens.

Q: Did you have any choice in this?

A: None whatsoever. In fact, the labor office also was run strictly along Nazi lines, I
mean we were treated very badly there, I mean with words, nobody was beaten there, but
just sort of insulted and we were just told where to work. Some others who were there,
by the way, were told to work also, were sent to other factories, but I happened to wind
up at Siemens.

Q: Did you feel a bit safer because they needed your output?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 43
A: At that time, the deportations hadn't started yet, so actually I felt, for two reasons, I
mean to put it mildly, disappointed. I mean one was that I had just been about, I don't
know, seven or eight months at the ORT school and was just sort of getting into it
learning all kinds of aspects of the trade, of being a mechanic, and that would be
interrupted now. And the second thing, of course, that I knew I would be working for the
German war production which didn't really make me obviously happy. At Siemens, the
Jews who worked there, and I think that is true of all other defense plants also, did not
work sort of scattered around throughout the factory here, maybe one machine operated
by a Jew and next to him by a German worker. Instead, the Jews were all in one
particular department where all workers were Jews except for the foreman, of course.
And in this way we also could be easier controlled. Number two, we were not permitted
to walk through the factory area unescorted. Now, that meant the shift started at 6:00
a.m. and it was already quite a walk from the factory gate to the building where we were
working. So we had to be at the gate at 5:45 to be picked up by a guard which then led us
to our department where we then punched in, we had to punch in before 6:00. If
somebody missed that guarded walk from the gate to the department, then a separate
guard had to be sent and the foreman made a point of waiting after 6:00 and the person
had no way to get to the department and then he would send somebody down, the person
then would come and, of course, punch in after 6:00 and there was a rule that every late
appearance has to be reported to the Gestapo and so that was a very powerful incentive to
be on time. Even at that time, at which deportations hadn't started yet, because nobody
wanted to get entangled with the Gestapo. Furthermore, since we were not permitted to
walk through the factory alone, that also meant that there was no way how we could walk
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 44
to the toilets or restrooms whenever the individual need arose for a person. Instead, twice
a day, we were also under guard, conducted to the toilets. One was at 9:00 and the
second time after the lunch hour, around 1:00 or between 1:00 and 2:00. That meant if
somebody, for example, needed to go in between, that person had to report to the foreman
and depending on the foreman's mood at that particular instant, he could either tell the
person, well, you just have to wait, sorry, until the group goes, or he could give him a
dressing down and say, well, okay, I will detail somebody to take you down there. At
this point, by the way, all the workers, or the Jewish workers were men. Later on I will
mention that we also had many Jewish women and, of course, that was particularly
humiliating in that case if a woman had to go to that male foreman and tell him that she
has to go to the restroom and then for him possibly to sneer and to detail somebody to
take her down to the ladies room.

Q: What was the actual work you were doing?

A: We built a part of electric motors called commutators. We didn't know what they
were used for, there was a rumor these were motors which were built into submarines,
you know, for their electrical supply, but that whether that was true or not, we didn't
know. Anyway, these commutators present an essential part of an electric motor.

Q: Were there any attempts to your knowledge, to sabotage in subtle ways, the
production?

A: To my knowledge not, I gave it a brief thought and rejected it outright because while
being there, of course, I also acquainted myself with the system, they had a very thorough
and sophisticated quality control system whereby any part that was produced before it left
the factory, went to a controller, somebody who checked it out electrically and so on, that
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 45
would have been, anything that I would have done to, you know, sort of make it
misfunction, would have been discovered by that person. So, first of all, it wouldn't have
achieved anything because it would have never gone to a place where it could have done
damage and secondly, as far as I remember they could trace who made it. So I would
have wound up in some horrible way without even achieving any purpose in doing so.
Yeah, I mean, the atmosphere, there were still a few German workers in that Jewish
department, actually, some even women, they had started to use women in factories,
which used to be also unheard of in Germany, but simply because of the labor shortage
after the war broke out, since you know most of the able bodied males, of course, served
in the Wehrmacht, in the army. And also, German workers, some actually were quite
nice, I have to say, and some others were very hostile, so it varied from person to person.
In the, as I said before, that happened on the 30th of April, 1941, and in the summer of
1941, there was rumor running around, we are going to get Jewish women. So,
obviously, there was big excitement, notwithstanding the fact that for these women it
probably was not so much of a pleasure, but at least we looked forward to some positive
diversions. And the rumor turned out to be true and so later on that day, I think in the
afternoon, a whole group of girls and women led again by a guard, of course, came in.
One of them particularly caught my eye immediately, she was in appearance exactly what
I had always looked for sort of in a woman as far as appearance is concerned, sort of dark
brown, close to black hair, and brown eyes, curls and looking in general, a very pleasant
facial expression and sort of a very Semitic expression in her face, which I always
enjoyed in a woman and still do, in fact. And it turned out, so I sort of concentrated my
attentions the first few days on her, I found out that her first name was Margot and I also
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 46
found out that she had a steady boyfriend, which didn't surprise me. So this immediately
cooled my interest, as least for the time being. We worked then together, I mean, we
were usually interspersed, there may have been a woman here and a male here and so on,
several males and so on, and among ourselves a real camaraderie developed, the chief
foreman was a man, his name was, I'll never forget, Alexander Siegel, and this, he was
about in his, retrospectively guessing, in his late 30's, I would say, possibly 40, and sort
of a real rough neck, extremely nice to all females, who also after the war really didn't
find much reason to complain about him. And very gruff to males, and myself, I again
started to rub him the wrong way and me the wrong way, so I was sort of on his list to
bark at whenever he found a pretext for doing that. Yeah, I also met, that is very
important, a male, in fact that was already on the first day that I started to work there, a
male, I mean a man a few years older than I, his name was Hans Fabisch and we became
really extremely close friends, it was my first close friend since I lost the one whom I had
in high school, who emigrated to England. And we really went through thick and thin,
we were, we became close personal confidants, we shared our recreational hours and did
a lot together and talked a lot and he was probably one of two or three best friends that I
ever had. He was, as | said, a few years older than I and he had decided to study
medicine and was already, he had all kinds of medical books at home and had started to
sort of self-educate himself in anatomy and other similar medical subjects. Oh yeah, that
reminds me of something else. Since we graduated from high school, there was really no
educational outlet for us. Universities, of course, we were prohibited from enrolling in or
even attending classes, and there was really nothing else except, you know, my
apprenticeship to become a mechanic. So, with a group of other friends and also
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 47
particularly former classmates from my high school graduating class, we developed sort
of a set of informal talks which were held in different apartments of us sort of moving
around. At that time I didn't use that word, but later on it occurred to me it was almost
like an underground university. First of all, our German teacher, who was actually a very
highly educated man and also in philosophy, he taught us sort of a course in philosophy
and it was partly that he talked and partly it was done already in seminar style, where he
would assign certain topics to one of us and that person had to report back at the next
time and give a little talk on that. And this Hans Fabisch, whom I just mentioned, he had
connections to various medical doctors and we got talks from, I don't know, various
medical subjects, you know, of general interest and so on and then somebody else, I
forgot who that was, knew an architect, a Jewish architect, these were all of course Jews
who talked and they were also happy because they were thrown out of their professions
and had nothing to do, particularly this former German teacher whose name, incidentally,
was Kurt Levinstein, he, the others sort of rotated, but he consistently, week after week,
he never took a penny and he taught with extreme enthusiasm, which sort of was
infectious even. And that was a tremendous sort of intellectual outlet for us which
otherwise we had really no outlet for. Another person that I would like to mention is a
girl who was a few years older than I, I think about four years, her name was Ruth Perl,
and she was part of that circle that also went to classes and she sort of became somewhat
close to my friend, Hans Fabisch and myself. And as time went on, I think closer to
myself, and we sort of started to strike up a friendship and we occasionally went to
movies together and it sort of developed that we became quite close and she was my first
girlfriend and we shared a lot of both personal thoughts, general thoughts and everything,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 48
also entertainment and so on. Oh, yeah, an important factor by the way, also, was music.
All of us in that circle and in various other circles were lovers of classical music and that
went also for Ruth, and it was in wartime, practically impossible to buy records. So
people in private apartments, I mean also many non-Jews, sort of started business
swapping, used records that is, and so I enriched my collection by, and by the way not
just swapping, but also selling, so I bought quite a number of records in those days that I
didn't have before. It should be remembered, of course, that the quality and the kind of
phonograph was a totally different world from what we have today. I mean, there was
obviously no high-fi, there was obviously, there was only one speaker out of an inferior
phonograph, and the phonograph was sometimes even hand driven by winding it up, and
if it was electric, then it was kept illegally by the way, because it should have been turned
in. But we managed to have sort of house concerts, also periodically, where we actually
made up a program like for a philharmonic concert, say some Beethoven symphony and
maybe a piano concerto by somebody else and different people would then bring those
records and then we would all assemble in somebody's living room and listen to it just the
way one would have gone to a philharmonic concert, which of course, was also forbidden
for Jews to go to. A drastic change in the situation of the Jews occurred with the
introduction of the yellow Star of David as of September 19, 1941. The law was very
specific that every Jew as defined by the Nuremberg laws has to wear such a yellow star
on his outer clothing whenever the person is in public, and it specified even exactly
where it had to be worn, on the left hand side at about the level of the heart and also it
couldn't be tagged on by pins or safety pins, but had to be firmly sewn on, and this way
they wanted to avoid that people might put on a star and then later on take it off again and
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 49
the Gestapo was known to walk up to Jews with a star and sort of try it with their hand,
with their fingers to get under it to see whether there is a space between the star and the
garment to make sure that it was firmly sewn on.

Q: They did this to you?

A: No, not to me, but they have done it to people. That made it finally impossible to, or
almost impossible I should say, for Jews to go to all the entertainments and cultural
offerings that were forbidden after Kristallnacht three years earlier. My friend Hans
Fabisch and I devised, actually it was his original idea, a method even to get around that.
And it was based on the following, that in those days double breasted suits and coats
were fashionable and if you had, if you buttoned it the way, I mean men buttoned their
suit jackets then the left side where the star was on was, of course, on the outside and
visible, but if you changed the buttoning, and most were also sewn in such a way that
there were button holes and buttons, you could button it either way, and the way say
women usually button them with the right part over the left, then the star would be
automatically covered up. That, it was important to have it that way because upon
leaving one's apartment and also walking in one's own neighborhood, it would have been
much too dangerous to walk around without a star because people know you and you
would have been immediately reported to the Gestapo, so what we did is we left our
neighborhood as good Jews with our yellow stars, walked many blocks, maybe 10, to an
area where nobody knew us, then ducked into an entrance of some apartment building
and quickly changed the buttoning of our jacket or coat and reappeared as Aryan
Germans and then we could go to a movie or anything without detection.

Q: Weren't you a little bit afraid of doing this?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 50
A: No, in fact, it sort of actually got me excited, like getting my adrenalin flowing that I
was doing something like that. My father, I should say, was horrified and forbade me
strictly to do that because not only did I endanger myself, very often the Gestapo would
then also arrest the rest of the family, but I just didn't want to listen to any advice of
caution and also I couldn't stand being so cooped up. I should make a reference,
incidentally, in connection with culture and movies. There existed a Jewish Kulturbund,
or culture society, that actually existed already since long before the Kristallnacht,
namely since the time when Jewish artists were summarily thrown out from all German
theaters and movie production companies, etcetera. And it was founded originally, of
course, to give Jewish musicians, actors, etcetera, a way of earning a living in their craft.
And it was always fairly well visited, I remember in the summer of 1939, I saw an
excellent performance of a Kalman operetta (Kalman was a Hungarian operetta
composer) Grafin Mariza, Countess Mariza, which was staged by the Kulturbund very
professionally and I enjoyed it very much. I have seen other things, too, but of course,
and then after Jews were prohibited from going to other general cultural events and
entertainment etcetera, then, of course, the Kulturbund became, in addition to providing
an outlet for fired Jewish artists, became also the only legal way at least, for the Jewish
population at large even to see a movie or a play or symphony. They had a very nice
symphony orchestra, by the way, all consisting of Jews. But anyway, I considered it
simply a challenge to do something that I was prohibited from doing by the government.
And so, we did that and my girlfriend, Ruth, went one day to a beauty parlor. Even
beauty parlors were forbidden for Jews, so of course, she didn't wear a Jewish star and
along the way she was stopped by a policeman, it was a regular policeman in uniform,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 51
and asked for her ID and when he saw that she was Jewish, he, the way she told it to me,
was evidently embarrassed and told her in an apologizing way that unfortunately, he is
forced by law to report that to the Gestapo, any transgression by a Jew had to be reported
to the Gestapo and he had no way to avoid that. And so we were terribly scared, and then
for weeks we didn't hear anything and so our scare sort of slowly subsided, although I
told her that if they really get after her, that she should simply go underground and then
she told me she will definitely not do that because she has no way to sustain herself and
doesn't know anyone where to go to, so anyway. On one day, in fact, on the 9th of
September, 1941, the 9th of September or the 9th of October, doesn't make a difference
anyway, she, we always met in the morning on the way to the factory, my train actually, I
had to change trains at a certain station and she, and join another train where she already
was sitting in and she always sat in the same car so from there on, we always rode
together. And on that morning, when I came into the railroad car where she was sitting
in, I took one look and knew what had happened. Her eyes were totally red from both
probably having cried and having been sleepless, and she pulled, without saying a word,
a letter from the, from her pocketbook and which had the dreaded head Geheime
Staatspolizei, the complete word for Gestapo, which is just an abbreviation. And it asked
her to appear on that morning at 9:00 in the offices, room such and such, with, that's all,
just to appear for an interrogation. But everybody knew what that meant. And she, now I
haven't really talked about the deportations, but the deportations had started a month
earlier and Jews working in defense plants were understood to be exempted from
deportations, so she had come to work mainly to show our foreman, Alexander Siegel,
the summons to see what he could do for her. But he coldly told her that there was
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 52
nothing that he could do for her because the Gestapo does have the complete lists of all
Jews employed by Siemens, and they know also of the agreement that Jews working in
defense plants are to be deferred, however, they can do what they want and there is
nothing more that he can do. And then we talked a little bit, the atmosphere was so
unbelievably stifling that I almost felt like somebody choked my throat, and then she said
goodbye to our mutual friend Hans Fabisch and to me and just walked out. It was the last
time I saw her. And, yeah, back up briefly, in September, just about a month before the
7th, the first deportation train left for the East and it was characteristic, it was
characteristic of all transports to the East, nobody knew where these people went to, it
was just said that it goes to the East.
Q: Who was deported, what kinds of groups or categories?
A: I don't think it was any particular category with the exception that those working in
defense plants were exempted, but otherwise, they just, I don't even know, I think the
Jewish community was enlisted in putting together lists for deportation. . .

End of side tape two.

Tape 3

Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997. The interviewer is
Randy Goldman, this is tape three, side A.
A: The deportations, the mechanisms of the deportation was handled, of course, by the
Gestapo at the command level, but it was carried out under order of the Gestapo by the
Jewish community organizations. And they put together the lists of Jews to be deported.
Sometimes the Gestapo would make particular demands, for example, at one time the
Gestapo was afraid that Jews who lived along the elevated train tracks might give
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 53
flashlight signals to Allied bombers and thus directing them to bomb the tracks, which on
its face was ludicrous because they would have then also directed the bombs to
themselves living right next to the tracks. But anyway, be that as it may, the Gestapo
ordered the Jewish community to provide such a list and get these people on the
deportation trains. But in general, that was one exception, the community picked the
people, that was initially a process where people were notified sometime ahead of time
by a letter which only said that their apartment has been designated to be cleared. It was
sort of as if that was all there was to it, that the apartment was to be cleared. But
everybody knew what it meant, of course. And with a set of detailed questionnaires
where all the assets had to be filled in and so on and then another questionnaire where all
the contents of the luggage, there were detailed instructions how much luggage in terms
of size and weight could be taken along, which items should be taken along and which
could not be taken along. Among those not to be taken along, for example, were
negotiable, anything negotiable value, securities, money, cash, jewelry and it had to be
filled out exactly what the contents of the luggage was that was to be taken along. Now
the result of that was that there was a wave of suicides. Many people who were too
scared to go through the deportations since nobody knew what really happened to these
people and so after awhile the Gestapo discontinued that and then went over to assist
them, where people were just being picked up without any prior notification. And
anyway, they had to be kept in a transit camp before being shipped out because the cattle
cars and freight cars that were used for deporting Jews, such a train was holding upward
of six, seven hundred people, even up to a thousand and eleven hundred. And it took
more than a day or two to pick up that many people, so they were housed in a transit
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 54
camp. At first the transit camp, in fact, was one of the synagogues until the military,
yeah, that synagogue, by the way, had been only lightly damaged during Kristallnacht
and had been repaired afterwards. So that was first used for a transit camp and then the
military sort of made a demand to have that synagogue for, I think, storage of some sort
or other. And then it was shifted to an old age home of the Jewish community and Jews
were collected there until they had enough people in there to fill a transport, then they
were taken away.

Q: During this process, were you very aware of what was going on?

A: Yeah, at that point, yes. And in fact, this group of people that I mentioned who were
also having various lectures and so on, we, at that point, we decided that we have to
somehow do something, at least, first of all, to find out what is happening because people
were being picked up and then never heard from again. Now, that in itself has a
tremendously terrorizing effect, somebody, your neighbor or maybe even your brother or
somebody close to you whom you still saw yesterday, today he was gone, or she. And
not only was that person gone, but I mean except for the fact that you knew they were
transported East, otherwise you had no inkling. There was never a letter or postcard
coming back, there was never any sign of life even, so that in itself had a terrorizing
effect, so but we were all very, very naive about the whole process. We sat down and
had a big sort of session where we threw out all kinds of ideas then we came away with a
great idea that whoever of the group is the first one to be deported, then has to see
somehow after getting to the East, to contact maybe German soldiers or somebody who
can get a message back to one of us describing what was happening. In the light of how
the deportations were handled, that was just unbelievably naive and, of course, the first
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 55
one of our group, there was a girl, I still remember her, and of course, she vanished
exactly like everybody else and nothing was ever heard from her. She obviously had no
chance to contact anyone. I mean, Jews who were deported were immediately, of course,
that was not really known at that time, but they were immediately put into either ghettos
or extermination camps. And in extermination camps, many were immediately on the
spot gassed and that who were not gassed were kept in that camp for hard labor and had
no way to communicate with anybody outside of that camp. It was just totally
impossible.

Q: And your family? They were all fine?

A: Yeah. Of course, again, the thing was that my father considered himself lucky
originally because he was exempted from the forced labor because of a doctor certificate,
but now that labor was the only thing that exempted you from deportation, that turned out
to be not so lucky. He went through several stages of such real ironies. Now, of course,
he would not have been in a position really to do factory work, however, he, now he
knew one of the personalities at the central, at the congregation offices and, in fact, it was
a woman who was in charge of the sort of deportation decisions and so on. And she gave
him an unpaid job there for the community, what he did he never really talked about and
he was, I mean like in all other things, very close mouthed, but I know he had some work
at the Jewish community that may have exempted him for some time. Now, in April of
'42, oh, I have to back up, actually. Now I remember I made a mistake when I talked
about the arrest of my girlfriend, Ruth. I know that I said it was in either September or
October of '41. It was actually '42. In '41 the deportations had barely started and it was
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 56
in October of '42, or September, I don't know, that her arrest took place. Okay, coming
back, my parents were actually arrested in April of '42 and by the Gestapo.

Q: Now, I want to interrupt you for a second. Because on your notes, I see that you said
they were imprisoned in December of '42.

A: Yeah, well I'm coming to that.

Q: Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

A: And they were taken to the collection point, to that synagogue that I referred to, but
the Gestapo officers who arrested them said, oh yeah, what happened was that my father
had agreed with his personal physician that he would either commit suicide or take some
strong sedative which would totally knock him out and the physician prescribed to him
something called Veronal. I don't think it exists here now, at least not under this name, so
I don't know what it would be here. But, he immediately took that and was sort of like in
a coma, so he was, obviously they couldn't take him along, so they put in a phone call and
had the Jewish hospital pick him up and then my mother and sister were taken and they
told me to come along because they said it's likely if the father is not capable of being
transported, that my mother and sister would be sent home again. So that is also one of
the weird examples where occasionally they had something that might almost sound like
humane in all this murderous brutality. At any rate, I spent several hours in that transit
camp and it was a horrible sight. The Jews there, it was a synagogue, and the people who
were to be sort of awaited their deportation, they were all at the balcony. I mean,
European synagogues at that time, and I think still today in fact, separate the sexes, men
pray downstairs and women in the balcony, so they had all of the people for deportation
in the balcony and you could see sort of people up wandering around absentmindedly and
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 57
so on, and in a daze. And then on the ground floor, which was the area where men used
to pray, that's where the Gestapo, they had their offices and they would periodically call
somebody down to fill out forms and for interrogation and so on. So anyway, after
several hours my mother and sister were told they could go home again and so that's what
we did. And they handed me our luggage back, their luggage, and then we went back.

Q: Did you think that when you were in that synagogue that you might all be leaving and
that it was just a ruse?

A: No, I didn't. It didn't occur to me. But maybe that was just my habitual optimism, I
don't know. Now as time went on, the situation became more and more unbearable. I
remember one co-worker in the factory, from the Jews he was probably about five years
older than I. He appeared one morning with a totally lost expression. The night before
when he came home from work, he found the apartment empty. He had a wife and a little
baby girl, I think, and they were gone. I mean, he couldn't even say goodbye to them.
They were gone, and he was supposed to continue working. And there were many
similar horror stories, and they were constantly, of course, circulating and, in fact, since
all Jews were also no longer permitted to buy newspapers, by the way, and as we
discussed before, also had to turn in their radios, so there was a new way to sort of spread
the news, and that was called sort of radio by mouth or mouth radio. And I mean the
psychological situation became just unbearable, it was sort of a combination of a fear of
the worst to come and being trapped into something where one has no control and mixed
with a desire to do something about it. I mean, many of my friends, also my friend Hans
and I and so on, we talked about going underground, but to go underground that means
going into hiding with forged papers, seemed like such an enormous undertaking, I mean
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 58
first of all to get forged ID's and it would cost a lot of money and then food would have
to be procured on the black market and, of course, none of us had any money to speak of,
so it was mainly a lot of talk. Now some people, mainly those who were politically
engaged, they were able to go underground and be protected by politically like-minded
people. That was true, especially of communists. Oh yeah, and talking about
communists, there was a Jewish communist cell actually centered in one of the other
Jewish departments at Siemens and headed by a man named Herbert Baum and his wife,
Marianne Baum, B-A-U-M. And they had been, apparently, an underground cell for
years only of Jews and basically just meeting and sort of like holding seminars about
Marxism and the dangers of capitalism and fascism and so on and then at some point they
decided that wasn't really enough and something had to be done to fight back against the
Nazis. And in the, it was also sort of the summer, I think, of 1942, in the center of Berlin
the Nazis staged a vast exhibit under the name the Soviet Paradise and, of course, they
meant it sarcastically and the exhibit was devoted to materials which they had, you know,
uncovered in their process of conquering large parts of the western Soviet Union and
much of it may have been true, much of it was lies, whatever, and the exhibit was
apparently quite successful, there was throngs visiting it, so they decided to burn it down.
But, of course, they were not experts at anything, I mean they were not experts in
sabotage and in technical things and so on, so it was a big tragedy, they succeeded in
putting in a small fire somehow, the damage was so minimal that the Germans even could
keep it out of the newspapers. If it had been a major fire, they would have had no choice
but to at least report it, but it wasn't even reported in the press. And not only that, but
immediately they didn't catch anybody, they sort of, they scattered certain delayed
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 59
incendiaries which you put somewhere and then it takes five minutes or so for the flame
to break out, so they were gone by the time, so nobody was caught. But the Gestapo had
found a network of undercover agents in the underground communist movement, anyway
the details I don't know. The fact is, that they got on their trail, they were arrested all of
them and the first thing that the Gestapo did is tell the Jewish community that they want
500 Jewish men immediately, 250 of them will be shot on the spot and another 250 will
be immediately deported to concentration camps. And if any sabotage by where Jews are
involved happens again, they will take 10 times as many people. And that was a horror
that immediately spread through this mouth radio, of course, and I knew some of the
people involved, incidentally, because it was centered at Siemens, and the Baums were at
Siemens. And so that contributed to the demoralizing effect. As a sideline, I want to say
that they became great heroes in the now defunct German Democratic Republic, formerly
East Germany, and there was a street named after them and books were written and so on.
But, of course, they are all dead. Actually, one of the members of the group was a girl
who graduated with me from that high school, she was in my class, and in fact, I
remember that after graduation, I once had a long discussion. She was then already a
communist, and she tried to convert me. All I remember is that we had a very lively hard
hitting discussion and | didn't convince her and she didn't convince me. But it never
occurred to me that she would belong to the, if she would have convinced me, who
knows, maybe I would have been in that group also. Anyway, yeah, they were all tried
by the so-called People's Court, that's the same court that also convicted those, you know,
plotters who tried to assassinate Hitler two years later in July, '44. And of course, most
of them were executed, a few got some jail sentences. Alright, this is basically the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 60
atmosphere, now also I should say about Siemens, coming back to that, I said already that
we got no worker food ration stamps and even less than the general consumer, we got
paid less than the German workers who did similar work and I said we couldn't go to the
toilets, also we couldn't use their cafeteria, we had to bring our own lunch and sort of eat
it at our work desk and of course, we had no right to vacation time. And, but through my
friend Hans Fabisch, whom I mentioned earlier and who was training to become a
physician, he sort of advised me on certain back symptoms which cannot be traced by a
doctor which are purely subjective, but make you incapable of working, it has to sort of
hurt at a certain point and when the doctor pushes this way it hurts more and that way it
hurts less, and so I feigned that and so I received an official sort of a statement, yeah, as a
Jew I couldn't just call in, I'm sick today, you had to have a physician certified written
statement, you know, that Ernest Fontheim, you know, has blah, blah, such and such a
sickness or disease and is not capable to come to work. So anyway, I got that following
his instructions, that was in the latter part of December. So on December 24th, then I was
at home. I want to come back, I said earlier in this interview, that Christmas played a
special role in our family and I meant that in many ways, it played a role as I grew up
because we always had a Christmas tree and we, and Santa Claus came and we had gifts.
Well, on the 24th of December, 1942, my parents were arrested and my sister. And it
happened this way. I was actually that was when I was on that fake sick leave and I had
left the apartment to make a phone call from a public phone, as I said we didn't have a
phone. Public phones were also prohibited to Jews but by walking a few blocks and
hiding my star I could then go into a booth and I was making a call to the parents of
Margot, whom I had met sometime earlier. And they had a phone because they were
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 61
subletting an apartment that was in the name of a Hungarian Jewish woman and since she
was not a German citizen, all these German laws, these antisemitic laws, did not apply to
her, even though she was a Jew, but so anyway, so they had that phone and I called them
up, I don't even know why anymore, it doesn't make a difference, but when I went back,
we lived now in that apartment with these relatives of ours that I described earlier, which
was a second floor apartment and as I approached the apartment, I noticed my sister, Eva,
leaning out the window and waving me away. And I knew immediately, in those days
you knew always what was happening on a signal. And so I walked away, I knew the
people were there to pick my family up. So I walked just maybe 50 yards or so back so
that I was still in view and watched what was going on. And then after a while the janitor
came, the janitor actually happened to be also a Jew, but lived in a mixed marriage and
was protected therefore by, through the Nazi laws. And he came and said I should come
up, the people who came for the pickup were actually Jewish orderlies and they go
strictly by lists and my name, there were just the names of both parents and my sister. So
I went up and there was total frenzy at home, of course, and my father was again out, he
had done the same thing, and one of the orderlies had already gone down to call the
Gestapo to say that he was not, could not be transported. And he came back after, I don't
know, 10, 15 minutes saying he was told that my father has to be brought under whatever
circumstances, even if they have to carry him down the stairs in a chair. And then my
parents were frantically packing, I mean most people had already most of the things
packed and so did they, but there are some last minute things. My father was not
completely out in a coma, but in a very weakened state and he took my hands and said we
will never see each other again. And then my sister suddenly out of the blue, threw her
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 62
arms around my neck and had an incredible crying spell. Her whole body shook and I
kept her close and I frequently thought to myself why I simply did not take her and walk
out with her. That is a question which I have asked myself ever since. Then when the
preparations were done, my father was actually really carried down the steps in a chair;
and the picking up of Jews was done by a moving van from a company that I'll never
forget, the name was Scheffler. Of course, the Gestapo presumably leased those vans,
and inside the vans they had long benches where the Jews that were picked up were sort
of lined up and then sitting until it was full and then the van would go to the transit camp.
By that time the transit camp had shifted from the synagogue where it used to be still in
April, to a former old age home of the Jewish community.

Q: And your sister, your mother and father?

A: Yeah, and actually, I decided to ride along in that van for some blocks to be together
with them some more. And then at the corner of Giintzelstrasse and Trautenaustrasse I
said goodbye and jumped out the back and that was the last time I saw my parents and
my sister on December 24, 1942, Christmas Eve. On the next day our doorbell rang and
when I opened, I was surprised to see my former mathematics teacher, Dr. Baer, from the
Jewish school. He told me that he was serving as an orderly in the transit camp and had a
message from my mother, and he added that it was strictly forbidden for orderlies to
make any communication between people in the transit camp and people outside, but
since I had been his student for quite a number of years and he knew me already as a
smaller boy, he did it out of a gesture of friendship. He told me first of all that my
mother had forgotten certain things that he offered to bring in and they would also be
glad if I could pack some additional food and then he added that my mother also told him
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 63
that she was interrogated the day they arrived there by the Gestapo, and the Gestapo
showed particular interest in me. They wanted to know what hours I work, when I come
home from work, etcetera. And I knew immediately that that was a message and
obviously the message was never to go back. So that's what I did. At that point I had no
place to stay. But as I just mentioned earlier, the parents of my co-worker, Margot, in
whom I had been interested at first, lived, sublet an apartment that was actually registered
in the name of a Hungarian Jewish woman and, therefore, was not on the Gestapo list.
And they had a small sort of a maid's room, aside of the apartment but it belonged to it,
which they used for storage, but they said that I could stay there and sleep there also. So
that's what I did. On New Year's Eve, December 31, first of all I knew at that time that
no transport had left Berlin, so I knew that my parents were still there and I was there
with Margot and her parents and also with a friend of theirs, I forgot his name, he was
sort of an elderly man, about 60, in his 60's, and his entire family had been arrested, but
he had some contact to the Gestapo and was negotiating with them to bribe them to get
his family out. And he was supposed to meet his Gestapo contact the next day, but he
also knew the Gestapo had power to do anything; they could just take whatever he had to
offer, arrest him too and laugh in his face. And that New Year's Eve was the most
horrible New Year's Eve that I ever had in my life. My parents and sister were in the
transit camp, my girlfriend Ruth was already long gone and I didn't know what would
become of me and that man was there with his horror story. The atmosphere was so
unbelievably gloomy that it is even hard to describe. I kept in touch with my friend Hans
Farbisch, of course, and he actually had met a physician, a Jewish physician whom he
was going to marry. She was a few years older than he and she was Austrian so that's
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 64
why, otherwise a person of that age wouldn't have had a medical degree in Germany
because in Germany a Jew couldn't study any more since 1933, but coming from Vienna,
she could study until '38. Anyway, she had her medical degree and her name was Valli
and they got married in the first week of January, wait a minute, yeah. And Hans and I
discussed the possibility maybe of going underground together. But a basic difference of
opinion developed between Hans and myself. He, his philosophy was that as long as we
were employed at Siemens, we were protected and deferred from deportation. On the
other hand, if we went underground and were caught in some ID check on the street
without a star, that meant immediate deportation. Therefore, he felt at this point it was
much safer if we stayed legal, quote, worked at Siemens and were protected that way and
then go underground whenever the, you know, the deferment would no longer be valid or
Siemens might lay us off or whatever. I, on the other hand, argued that the Gestapo was
not going to send us printed invitations or announcements saying now you are no longer
protected and deferred. That is going to come overnight without that anybody knows it
and then it's going to be too late. It is true right now it is safer to be walking around with
a star and working at Siemens because that is protection, but because of the uncertainty of
how long that is going to last, there is no, that risk we have to take. And there was
another point, in fact, which leads me to briefly flash back to our time at Siemens. I had
forgotten to mention that already since the fall of 1942, we received in our department
forced laborers from occupied, German occupied territories. It started out with a group of
French women and after a while, we also got Polish women to work in our department.
These were all people who were deported, obviously, against all international law and
without their consent, into Germany to work for war production. And | also referred to
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 65
that in talking to Hans, that it's very obvious, first of all the Germans have millions and
millions of people in the occupied territories and a few tens of thousands of Jews, so I,
why do they need a few tens of thousands of Jews if they can be replaced from a pool that
has millions of people. And they have already started to introduce these people in our
department and they know already how to do the things that we are doing, so I think that
probably the time is imminent even that these deferments for work in defense plants are
going to lapse. But we did not, obviously, resolve that difference of opinion. Hans
himself felt that for the time being he was safer that way. He did, however, do one thing
and that is to order forged ID's. A forged ID at least for himself to go, it was practically
impossible to live in Germany without some sort of an ID because there were frequent
checks for identification on the streets, there was a whole spectrum of agencies who
could do that in addition to just the ordinary police, there was the Gestapo, of course,
which was essentially a political police, there was the so-called criminal police, these
were detectives looking for common criminals, there was the military police, there was a
so-called labor police and probably other agencies that I wasn't even aware of. So,
basically, it was definitely necessary to have forged identification papers because if you
were asked for an identification on the, by any one of these agencies, and you were not
able to identify yourself to their satisfaction, that meant immediate arrest. Margot's father
had a contact that could provide a forged identification as an employee for the, an
organization called Deutsche Arbeitsfront, which means in English, German Labor Front.
End of side one of tape three.
Q: This is tape three, side B of an interview with Ernest Fontheim continued on March
13, 1997, the interviewer is Randy Goldman.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 66
A: This organization, the German Labor Front, was the Nazi answer, basically, to labor
unions. They had smashed, of course, the labor unions and declared them illegal and also
they declared that their ideology, this whole idea of class warfare and of a sort of
adversarial relationship between management and labor is not in the sense of Germanic
nationalism. Instead they formed this German Labor Front which contained members
both of the employed laborers and employees and of management and owners and the
supposed idea was that in this forum, before conflicts arise, all issues will be discussed in
a cooperative way because both sides are obviously interested in the flourishing of the
company. This whole idea might have sounded good on paper, but it was, of course,
done mainly in order to smash the voice of the workers and to enable German industry to
increase production and mainly war production, without any disruptions. So, Margot's
father had some contact and for roughly the sum of fifteen hundred German Reichsmark,
which was the currency at that time, the opportunity, fifteen hundred apiece, of course, to
obtain ID's as an employee with the German Labor Front. This was, of course, a very
prestigious organization and so, and the ID also contained a passport picture of the
person, the obviously name, birthdate, address and so on and then a rubber stamp
numbered one, two, three, four, five, to be stamped, I think, semiannually, so that it also
had the impression of being updated on a semiannual basis. The rubber stamp came, was
just a number, came with the ID itself so we could sort of revalidate it every six months
for ourselves. Hans also agreed to buy this ID and sort of put it away in case when the
situation is what he considers ripe to go underground. In the meantime, as I had
mentioned earlier, I was already no longer living in our apartment because of the hidden
warning that my mother had conveyed to me and I lived in a small maid's room of the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 67
apartment of Margot's parents, but during the day commuted to our apartment because I
had decided to save as much as possible. And, incidentally, I should also add that at that
time, my parents and sister were still in the transit camp in that former Jewish old age
home. Only after the war, in fact fairly recently with publications of the history and so
on, did I learn of the brutal conditions in that camp. I mean, I never thought that there
would be nice conditions, but at least I thought, since it was an old age home, there would
be beds in there and they would at least have some form of amenities. I learned now that
a, some so-called specialists in Jewish emigration from the Vienna SS had been gotten to
Berlin on the orders of Adolf Eichmann and also to speed up the deportation of Jews, and
the first thing they, that the man in charge was a man named Alois Brunner incidentally,
his rank was SS Hauptsturmfihrer. The fact that he was in Berlin, in fact, was known at
that time, but what was not known is that his first act after arriving and looking at the
transit camp in that former old age home, that he ordered that all furniture be thrown out
the windows and that was literally done, they were thrown out of the windows, even
though there was a shortage of furniture for Germans. And there were just bare floors so
he could pack more Jews into the building. And so even in that transit camp already,
they must have lived under very miserable circumstances.

Q: How long was your family in that camp?

A: That comes to, their transport left on the 12th of January, it was a Tuesday and an
unbelievably unusually cold day, even for Berlin. And the departure of a transport
became known within hours always in Berlin because that couldn't, you know, there were
what, a thousand people were marched from the transit camp to the nearest, they didn't go
to a regular railroad station, but to a freight yard where they were loaded on like cattle.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 68
The, as I had said earlier, the arrest of my parents took place on December 24th and I
guess in order to allow the SS some Christmas vacation from their strenuous activities, no
transport went away from Berlin between December 24th and January 12th, so they were
there almost three weeks, two and a half weeks.

Q: Were you at work when they left?

A: No, [, as I explained earlier, I was on that faked sick leave and I simply never went
back. The sick leave, of course, was limited to, I forgot what it was, a certain number of
days, maybe a week, but by never going back then I was hoping that my absence
wouldn't be immediately noticed because obviously, if somebody was just absent, they
would immediately send orders for the arrest of that person.

Q: So, where were you when the transport left, did you see this procession?

A: No, no, no. I didn't see, I just heard that also through the mouth radio that I had
mentioned also at some point, that when, actually considering how primitive it was and
that we didn't even have telephones, was incredibly efficient how it went from, these
things went from mouth to mouth. Yeah, let me see. During that time, as I said, we, I
lived at the, in that maid's room at the apartment of Margot's parents which was really
very far away in distance from our apartment where we lived, so every day I went there
to pack things, yeah, and my plan was to have as much of personal effects and so on
picked up by a moving company. That moving company had been a client of my father's
when he was still practicing law, I still remember the name was Gebriider Zimmermann,
which means Brothers Zimmermann. The owner actually was a Mr. Schiitt and who was
very, I must say, was a fantastic man and he knew of course that we are Jews and he
stuck with us, he had already from our nice apartment where we were thrown out, a lot of
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 69
furniture stored in his storage place under a different name, and so that it couldn't be
traced. And I went to him and told him that my parents had been arrested and would be
deported and I wanted to save more things and he immediately agreed and the pickup
then was supposed to come on January 19th and I was supposed to designate all the
pieces that were supposed to be picked up and there were certain pieces of furniture that I
thought maybe at one time I might want to sell. And also, a trunk full of all kinds of
personal articles, it also contained the diary of my sister, she had kept a diary for a long
time and also particularly, the letter that my sister had written to me when she was, as a
harvest helper away from Berlin and I had written to her of the arrest of my girlfriend,
Ruth. And so I was busy then every day for a few hours in the apartment and always left
considerably earlier than I would have come back had I worked, so that I wouldn't be
running into some trap by the Gestapo. On the 18th of January, it was one day before I
had ordered the van, the moving van, to come. I was again doing some last packing to
finish up for the pickup on the next day, when one of the women I had mentioned earlier
that there were quite a number of people living, had been living in that apartment, one of
the women came and reported that the infamous pickup, moving van, was in the
Brandenburgische Strasse, that is the street where my friend Hans was living. I think I
had mentioned that the pickup of Jews for deportation was done by a furniture van, a
furniture moving van, of the firm Scheffler and Brandenburgische Strasse, as I said, was
the street where my friend Hans was living, although that was in midmorning and I knew
that Hans was at work at Siemens, but his wife, Valli, did not work and might be at home.
So I immediately grabbed my coat and raced, it was several blocks away from where our
apartment was, and then I turned the corner into Brandenburgische Strasse and saw that
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 70
van parked right in front of their house. And it struck me like lightening, I stopped for a
few seconds, considering how that house also like all houses where Jews lived, of course,
was a so-called Jew house which meant that there was a large number of Jewish parties,
and I figured that the probability that they were just in their apartment is probably small,
and at any rate, I would never be able to face my friend if I didn't do anything I could to
get his wife out. So, and they lived, it was a walk-up on the fifth floor, I raced up the
steps, rang the bell and they had sublet one room, just in an apartment which was rented
by a Mrs. Striem, and the door, Mrs. Striem opened the door, her face looked horrible, as
white as even more white than this wall here, like this cuff, I've never seen her like that.
And she looked completely dejected and all she said, "what are you doing here? Get
away quickly!" And then instead of turning and running, I asked, "is Valli, I want to talk
to Valli". Then she repeated, "get away!" And upon that, I saw behind her a man in an
SS uniform appearing and at that point I turned around and raced down and was on the
landing below when I heard a thunderous voice in a Viennese dialect saying, halt
immediately. And I turned around, I saw an SS officer leaning over the balustrade and
with a drawn pistol pointing at me. And I got such a shock of scare that almost my knees
buckled under me and I walked back up and he got me in, closed the door and the first
thing, your papers. And then I pulled out my forged ID from the German Labor Front
which he looked at carefully and compared my face with the picture on the ID and then
he barked at me what I was doing there. You know, because there was supposed to be no
contact between so-called Aryans and Jews. And, of course, the question totally caught
me by surprise and I was so devastated and fearful anyway that I couldn't think straight
so all I could blurt out was that the Jew who lives here still owes me some money which
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 71
in that respect was stupid and the guy didn't even catch it because if he owed me money,
that meant that I must have loaned it to him and if I loaned him money, what business did
I have loaning money to a Jew, but he didn't pursue it. But instead, he took my ID put it
in his uniform pocket and said, I want to ask you some more questions tomorrow, I want
you to come to my office at Gestapo headquarters, such and such street address, room
number so and so, I forgot that, but I do remember at 9:00 tomorrow morning I want to
see you there and then you will get your ID back. And then I left and I felt as if I had sort
of escaped from hell, that was one of the two or three scariest episodes in my entire life.

I went down, but I had at least one thing, while we were standing, that little conversation
took place inside their door, in a little sort of like a vestibule, and the various rooms went
off it, and in Hans' room I didn't see a person. So it seemed to me that Valli wasn't there.
So as I raced down as quickly as possible because I thought maybe the guy changes his
mind, I decided, then I walked out of the house to the street and to the next corner was
several houses. So I walked to the next corner and around the corner, but then I
positioned myself there on the corner so I could see who approached the house and I was
hoping that if Valli would come, that I could signal or shout at her and get her away. It
was also a cold winter day, the 18th of January, and I stood there. In the meantime, that
van had already left, but it was known that sometimes if a person that they were looking
for wasn't there, they left somebody behind so that's why I stuck there until my legs were
really like just columns of ice and I couldn't stand it anymore, and at 4:00 also was shift
change, I felt I had to notify Hans. And, of course, that was a tricky thing because I was
by that time, away without, from work without permission, so I couldn't be seen there.

So I went to the elevated station that we went to when we went to work at Siemens and
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 72
then walked toward the factory, but didn't walk all the way, but sort of hid in the entrance
of an apartment building which was still a block or two away from the factory, but where
people at the shift change would sort of stream past. And of course, by that time it was
winter, it was already fairly dark. So I stood there and then when Hans came by, I
whistled to him and he stopped and was surprised to see me and I told him the events of
the morning and of course, he got very depressed and agitated by that. Anyway, we went
then together back, and then when we arrived in front of his house and looked up, there
was the. In wartime windows had to be darkened in order not to give away locations to
enemy airplanes, but often, I mean not often but always, there was sort of a small slit of
light coming just from the edge where the curtain just quite didn't hit the wall. And we
saw some light coming out of his apartment so we both felt somebody must be home at
least. So we rushed up and on the floor below, Hans turned to me and said, you know,
why don't you wait here. I'll go up and if everything is clear, I'll call you. So I stood one
floor below and watched him and he put the key into the lock but hadn't turned it yet,
when the door opened from the inside. And I saw a tall grey haired civilian opening the
door who didn't belong there, never seen before in my life, and he immediately looked
down and shouted to me, who are you? And then I turned around and ran as fast as I
could. I never ran as fast in my life, I think, and that was the last time I saw Hans. And
as sort of a sideline, that was the 18th of January, 1943, exactly to the day five years later
that my high school friend from that orthodox high school, on the 18th of January, '39, no
four years later I guess, left Berlin to emigrate to England. So I left I guess the two best
friends that I had in my life, I lost on the same day, on the 18th of January, the only thing
is the one who left for England, left for life and he is still alive, he's in Jerusalem now.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 73
So then I went back again to Margot's parents and there was a terrible argument. Her
father accused me that I was reckless, that I should have never, by having that ID
confiscated that means now that ID may even be useless now because the Gestapo
knows, they obviously are going to find out that this is a forged ID and I was endangering
everybody else and so we had a big argument about that. And then, not only that, but I
probably overreacted and overestimated the efficiency of the Gestapo, but at that time I
thought they could probably lift my fingerprints from that ID, and all Jews had been
fingerprinted already, years before, so they had a fingerprint file of all Jews and
experienced criminologists can match fingerprints, so it occurred to me that, what if they
match my fingerprint, find out who I really, who the owner of that ID really was and then
come to the apartment and if the moving van is just there, they will immediately find out
that this is being picked up, you know, by that firm of Zimmermann and that will lead
them to me somehow. So I called up the firm and cancelled the pickup and that was one
of the most horrible mistakes of my life. It wasn't the furniture, but it was the personal
things that were contained in the trunk. The trunk contained my sister's diary, her letters,
including the letter that she had written to me after the arrest of Ruth and I never went
back to that building simply because I was afraid that it might be staked out. While the
Gestapo, as far as I know, never looked just for Jews who were in hiding in particular, but
in a case where there was a forged ID from an important Nazi agency, they would surely
be interested in finding out how that ID was obtained, from whom, etcetera, etcetera, so
that would have been worthwhile to stake that address out. I just, in retrospect, don't
believe that they were that efficient that they would have had all of that figured out within
less than a day, but at that time, I felt strongly that it was too unsafe to go back and also
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 74
too unsafe to have the moving company come because that would have led them to me.
The result of this is that I have no personal belongings of my sister whatsoever. I have
pictures, of course, but that's all. We intensified now the search for a place to hide.
Margot's parents, and incidentally, and of course I immediately had to practically move
mountains to get another ID. Margot's parents were also planning to go underground, but
didn't, had one or two possible sort of options, none of which was ideal. Then I came up
with an idea and that was the former office supervisor of my father's law office. It was a
Mrs. Frieda Kunze. She was actually a marvelous person. She had been in his office as
far back as I can remember. I don't know whether she was there since before I was born
or since I was a little boy, but as long as remember. As a little boy whenever I was
taken to the office, she was already working for my father and in the last years, she was
his office supervisor. And she held to us even after my father lost his license to practice
and, of course, then she lost that job. She visited us frequently and I remember often she
brought us food even, that she had taken from her own not very generous rations. And
she owned a primitive weekend cottage in a village about roughly 35 miles southeast of
Berlin. And I didn't, all I knew is that she owned that place, I didn't know, I had never
been there, what it was like or so, but I went to her and, of course, I told her also that my
parents and sister had been arrested and I told her that whether we could make some
arrangement that I and also a family of friends, that's a couple and a daughter, could live
in that cottage. And she said that, you know, because my father was such a marvelous
boss for decades for her and she also considered herself as a friend of the family, that she
would do anything to save my life. On the other hand, she wasn't so sure whether that
cottage really was the right place, she repeated again that it was very primitive and maybe
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 75
we ought to look at it. So first of all, of course, I introduced her to Margot's parents, I
think it was even the next day, we all went to her apartment and sort of got acquainted
and then we agreed on a day when we would together travel out and look at the place.
She said she hadn't been there even for a year or two and that it may be in a very
rundown state. So we went out there and it was sort of a settlement, this is a sort of
German custom actually, that there were settlements of colonies, sort of colonies of
cottages with very small pieces of land like gardens around them, which sort of say lower
middle class Germans would own to have a place to go to on weekends. And so we went
there and looked at the place. It was again a cold winter day and the first thing we
noticed was that the roof was leaking and the cottage was really very primitive, there was
of course, no inside running water, there was a pump in front of the house in the garden
and, of course, there was no electricity, there was an oil lamp there, but for that one had
to buy sort of a particular kind of petroleum which was almost impossible to get. Also
one could use candles, which also were hard to get. And then for heating, basically, there
was a kitchen stove which served both as a stove for heating and as a stove for cooking, it
was sort of a cast iron sort of a rectangular body on cast iron legs and on top there were
sort of concentric rings of iron which could be taken out and pots of different sizes put in
there to heat things and cook things. And that was all there was and the furniture,
obviously, was very primitive, there were two rooms and a sort of a veranda. And we
were desperate and so anyway, we said we would have to make do and she agreed to let
us have the place and, of course, she impressed on us the need to be extremely careful
and, but I mean, we were aware of that ourselves. Our punishment would have been
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 76
Auschwitz if we would have been not careful and would have been discovered and she
would have probably also wound up in a concentration camp.

Q: What about the neighbors?

A: Yeah, I'm coming to that. I mean that was just a visit there. So she let it, and she
didn't take, she took a small rent, I forgot what it was any more, it may have been on the
order of 40 to 50 mark per month, which at that time was nothing. And the garden,
incidentally, contained a number of marvelous fruit trees, some cherry and also plum
trees and even the, and she told us we could use the harvest and the harvest was so rich
that in terms of black market money, that was almost more than the 40 or 50 mark that
we paid her for the rent. And yeah, okay, so then we, that was agreed upon and then we
decided we would move out there as soon as possible, having, you know, we had to settle
certain affairs, but I didn't, I was out of our apartment and that was it and everything in
there was gone as far as I was concerned. But I had, the only things I had taken, of
course, personal items like clothing along already to the maid's room at Margot's parent's
house so I was all set up to move there. But they had to pack their things yet and that
took a few days and then actually on the 30th of January, 1943, we moved out to that, the
name of the village, incidentally, was Senzig, S-E-N-Z-I-G. And now a completely
different life started for us. I considered it at the time a real adventure, first of all, I was
finally off that continuous pressure that was increasing by the month of whether to be
picked up and to be deported and I felt for the first time in years, like a free person and I
also felt that I somehow I am in control of my life now, which I wasn't before. And
furthermore, I mean the threat was lifted and I could do what I wanted to do, not exactly
actually, but at least in a limited way. Yeah, there were obviously many, many things
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 77
now to consider. The first item was money. I have to, again, sort of back track a little
bit. My father had stored away some, what was called black money, in the years before
his arrest, because all Jewish assets, even if they were not confiscated, were blocked by
the German authority, by basically the German equivalent of the IRS, the Treasury
Department. That meant that these assets still belonged to the particular Jewish owner,
but he could not, he or she could not freely dispose of them. Each family had, was given
by the Gestapo, a maximum amount of money it could spend per month and withdraw
from the bank account. Obviously, that was all in preparation for confiscation. They
wanted to prevent that Jews stash away money. So and that was based entirely on the
size of the family. Like we were four people. So I don't know what the amount was, but
my father had a certain amount of money, maximum amount that he could spend. And
anything that he sold or so on, had to be paid into that blocked account also. But my
father did particularly at the time when our big apartment was given up, he sold many
items under the hand and established black accounts with a number of friends, basically
three. Two of them were former, no, one of them was a former client, that was a very
interesting man whom I'll talk about a little bit later. He was a furrier and, in fact, he had
the largest, probably the most prominent fur business in Berlin. One of his customers, in
fact, was none other than Hermann Goring, one of the top Nazis and commander in chief
of the air force in addition to many other offices that he held. And his name was Walter
Lange and, in fact, he had a Jewish wife and he told us that Goring called him up in the
summer of 1939 telling him, if you want to, your wife to be safe, get her out now and I'll
see to it that anything that she wants to take out, she can. At that time, an ordinary Jew
who emigrated, could take out only very limited amounts of valuables and so on. And he
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 78
shipped his wife out with I know oriental rugs and other valuables to England and they
had a son, by the way, and the son also, so they were now in safety in England, safety
except for German air raids, maybe. But, of course, he conducted, kept conducting his
business. And he, I forgot what the exact amounts of money were, but it was a fairly
sizeable amount that he kept in a separate account for my father. And my father had told
him and also the others that if anything happened to him, then I should have access to
these assets. The second person was actually the father of the German lawyer whom I
had mentioned earlier who had warned my father of his imminent arrest after
Kristallnacht and I think I mentioned at the time, that the father of this lawyer had been a
Minister of the Interior in one of the pre-Hitler governments of the Weimar Republic.
The son, the lawyer himself, who had warned my father, was by that time, of course,
drafted and was an officer in the Wehrmacht, but the father was an elderly gentleman and
he kept also a sizeable amount of money for my father and also was informed that I
should have access to these assets. The third person was my father's former accountant
and tax advisor. He actually had the smallest amount, but also I think it was somewhere
between five and ten thousand Deutsche Reichsmark, which was at that time fairly
sizeable. The interesting thing is that he was the only one who cheated me of the money.
Obviously, because of the danger for them and for us, no receipts were ever exchanged, I
mean it was all just by word of honor. And when I came to claim part of the money, he
told me with a straight face, and in fact, that was at the time that my father was still in the
transit camp, and he told me with a straight face that unfortunately my father did not
follow his advice to let him keep the money, but he picked the money up about three or
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 79
four months ago and he advised my father that was not a good idea, that he should, it
would be better for the safety of the money if he would keep the money.

End of side tape three.

Tape 4

Q: This is tape four, side A of an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 13, 1997.
The interviewer is Randy Goldman.
A: Yeah, IL, then had my father asked about that, as I explained earlier, my former
mathematics teacher, Dr. Baer, was an orderly employed in that transit camp and he
brought messages back and forth between my father and myself and also every day I
made sandwiches for them and he would take them in. And I sent a sort of, obviously,
cloaked message just saying that the accountant said that he had picked everything up and
my father sent a message back, that is definitely not so and he has everything. So I went
back to the accountant for a second time and told him the message of my father and he
became then at first just unfriendly, but when I kept persisting, he pointed to the
telephone and said if I don't leave him alone, you know, he has one phone call to make to
the police and then I can explain to them that he owes me money. Well at that point, I
turned around and left and I guess that's one of these unfortunate experiences. So money
was a problem. Another problem was, of course, how to arrange our lives there. We,
these plots in these settlements are very close together, you cannot live there literally in
hiding and avoid people, in fact, that would have aroused suspicion. Neighbors are
traditionally, in these settlements, very close, talk to each other and so on, so we decided
we, first of all, we have to have a believable story, you know, who we are and so on. So
we concocted a whole sort of curriculum vitae for ourselves and the story was, our papers
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 80
incidentally were all made in the last name of Hesse, mine, too, H-E-S-S-E. And the
story was that this was a couple with their daughter, Margot, and I was a nephew, in other
words, the son of Mr. Hesse's brother. And my parents had been killed in an accident
while I was still a baby and I had been raised by my aunt and uncle and so. They were
almost total strangers to me, I just met them a few months before, but I had to train
myself to address them in the sort of familiar German Du form and also, instead of
calling them Mr. or Mrs. Hesse, I had to call them Uncle Hermann and Aunt Lucy. And
incidentally, the name Hermann Hesse also was chosen because from the telephone book,
that actually Mr. Hesse found that out, there existed a real Hermann Hesse at a Berlin
address and that was the address that we gave. So if somebody just made a cursory
check, say with our ID, there existed such a person at the address that we gave. Okay, we
also had to have credible stories of what our lives were like. For example in my case, a
German, which I pretended to be, would normally be inducted into the army and, of
course, I was a civilian. Now [| after my ID was taken away by the SS, from the German
Labor Front, I acquired after a few months another ID as a technician in one of the major
German defense plants in Berlin. And that, of course, was in itself an excellent alibi
because a person of such technical expertise would be deferred from military service.
However, I should also add that the ID requirements were much more rigorous. For
example, every male of military age, and I don't remember any more up to what age that
was, but surely much more than my age at that time which was 20. Every such person
had to have military papers. If the person was actually a member of the Wehrmacht, it
means of any one of the three branches, army, navy or air force, the person had to have a
Militarpass, military pass, with picture, identifying the unit, etcetera, etcetera. If the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 81
person was exempt from military service for whatever reason, then also a military paper
with picture and other personal information, stating that reason, be it deferment for job
reasons or maybe for health reasons, somebody may have had only one leg, for example,
the paper would have to state what the reason was and that also had to be carried on the
person and shown on request. In the case of job deferment, in fact that paper was only
issued for a limited time, I forgot exactly but I believe it was six months. So after, it had
to be revalidated every six months. That made it very difficult to obtain forgeries. First
of all, forgeries of military papers were very rare and hard to get in the first place, and
then it was only valid for six months; then it had to be revalidated. And as I said, I had
now obtained an ID as a technician for a defense plant in Berlin and I, and with that I
lived for the rest of the war, showing it the many times that I was asked for an ID and in
fact, it was convincing enough so that there was never a follow-up question, but I was
aware of the fact that each time the official asking me to identify myself could have asked
where is your Wehrmacht ID? And then I had already prepared one fall back and that
was that I would pretend to go through the, I would actually go through the pockets of my
jacket and pretend to look for the paper and then with surprise on my face say, ah, I must
have left it in the coat that I wore yesterday. And at that point, the official could have
said, well, I believe you this time, but be sure don't forget it again. He could, however
also, have told me, in that case I have to take you along to check you out, in which case I
would have been done. And in fact, that never occurred and in all of my cases where I
was controlled for ID, that ID that I had and the one that I obtained later that I will
discuss then, was sufficient. I think that also had to do with the fact that I had learned by
living in Nazi Germany since '33 and by being in that Nazi gymnasium or high school for
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 82
two years from '33 to '35, I had learned exactly the correct Nazi demeanor. They were in
many ways sort of very naive almost bordering on the childish. For example, whenever I
was asked for an ID, before I did anything like showing my ID, I would in this military
demeanor click my heels, I had special heels for that with sort of iron or steel plates to
provide the impressive military click that German soldiers had, I would stretch out my
right arm, say a snappy Heil Hitler, and then I would show my, and such silly little things
would make just the right impression and would dispel any, in most cases at least, any
suspicion that I could be anything but a convinced and truthful Nazi. Yeah, that was my
case. Then the case of Mr. Hesse, Margot's father, he was actually by profession a tailor
and pattern maker and had owned a women's coat factory in earlier years, in the '30's, and
then when forced labor came, he was actually drafted into a uniform, military uniform
factory and had also, even though he was a Jew, a position of sort of a supervisory
position there because of his background and knowledge. So he carried that, continued
that and also said that he was in such a factory. In addition to that of course, he had the
ID for the Deutsche Arbeitsfront, which was sort of like a secondary position he
pretended. Margot's mother had an undefined office job in Berlin and Margot herself
actually was by training a baby nurse and she worked in sort of a German nursery. These
started to spring up now, today they would be called day care centers, because many
German women were not exactly forcibly drafted to work in factories, but they were
strongly coerced and urged because there was a tremendous need, obviously, for factory
workers because German males were in the army. And because of the fact that many of
these women worked, there was a need for day care centers. So Margot pretended to
work in one of those. But that alone, to have a job, a credible job wasn't really enough. I
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 83
mean, the thing is that village where we lived was about three to four miles away from
the nearest commuter station to Berlin and people either bicycled from the village and
parked their bicycles then at the railroad station, there were bicycle racks, or they took a
postal bus that sort of went down the country road which the village was at certain
schedules, I forgot what it was, but not very frequently, I think once an hour or so. And
now I went into Berlin actually twice a week to maintain contact with black market
sources to obtain food and so I made it a point then always to take the bus and people saw
me at the bus stop and, of course, I pretended to go to work to my factory. On other days
when I did not go there, since it was also known that I had a bicycle and I would bicycle
around the neighborhood, I simply sort of spread the word that whenever I had a chance,
I liked to bicycle, I would take the bicycle to that commuter line station and park it there
so that people wouldn't wonder why I wasn't there regularly. I forgot what Margot's
father's alibi was, he and his wife also went into Berlin twice a week to catch up with
their and keep contact with their black market sources. Margot herself was, number one,
the most Jewish looking of the four of us and on top of it, she was at that time always
extremely nervous and afraid, and so she stayed out there and never went into the city
and that created somewhat of a problem, but what she had to do was to stay inside the
house, I mean people didn't check up really literally, and she just stayed inside the house
all day and only appeared outside after, I don't know, five or six when people normally
would be home from their jobs. Another very important issue was that of police
registration. In Germany at that time, and I believe even today still, every person has to
be registered with the police at his or her place of residence and a person can only have
one place of residence. Now, all the people out there who lived in these houses, in these
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 84
cottages, some were as primitive as ours, others may have been a little bit more fancy,
they actually had apartments in Berlin where they were registered with the police and
they moved out there because just about the time when we went underground, air raids
increased tremendously, particularly the American air force which was stationed at air
fields in, on the British Islands and would regularly attack Berlin. Later on, actually, on a
daily basis, in early '43 it wasn't that frequent, but still frequent enough for people to be
scared. So, therefore, people preferred the safety of some village which surely wouldn't
be bombed, to being in Berlin and being trapped in an apartment building. But that, of
course, posed a problem for them because, as I said, by law everybody has to be
registered and a person can only be registered at one place with the police. So if these
people would have to, so if you, if a person moved there was actually also a
de-registration form. The person had to de-register at his or her old residence and then
the person actually received a copy of the de-registration form to present at the new place
where the person would then register. Well, if the people would have done that, would
have de-registered in Berlin, they would immediately have lost their apartments since as a
result of the air raids many people lost their apartments and there was practically no new
building going on because of wartime conditions and all of the raw material and labor
were really put into the war effort to build tanks, planes and whatever else was needed.
So there was an acute and increasing shortage of apartments, so if somebody moved out
of his apartment, the first thing was that it would be snapped away by the housing
authority and the apartment would be given over to some bombed out family. And of
course, people wanted to maintain their apartments. To make a long story short, the
result was that all of these good Germans who lived out there, lived there essentially,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 85
quote, illegally. They did not register there because they couldn't because they didn't
want to de-register and give up their Berlin apartments. The local police which was in
charge of that, of course, knew about it and simply looked the other way because it was
understandable, you know, people didn't want to lose their city apartments. And that was
a perfect argument for us because we couldn't register for different reasons, we were
underground Jews. But we had that perfect argument, of course we had our apartment in
Berlin and as I mentioned earlier, the address that we gave, the fictitious, there was
actually a Hermann Hesse living there, so somebody could check us out in the telephone
book and we were there only for fear of the air raids. So actually I always felt that was
the first time in my life that the Americans came and helped me. So, alright, that was,
yeah, and then what we did in the beginning was, we had several sessions in that little
cottage where we interrogated ourselves on all of these issues, you know, I mean who I
was, I was a nephew and that my parents had died while I was still a baby and I was
raised by my aunt and uncle and where I worked and where they worked and so that
became part of our nature, we constantly asked ourselves these questions so that nobody
would ever make a slip-up or give some wrong answer or even an answer contradicting
somebody or somebody else who said something. And, alright, I should say also by the
way, the date that we moved out there, I mentioned earlier was the 30th of January, 1943,
was an extremely interesting date. First of all, it was the 10th anniversary of Hitler's
assumption of power, that he was named Reich Chancellor, and secondly and more
important for us, it was the day on which Field Marshall Paulus, commander of German
Sixth Army in the Ukraine, surrendered his army in the city of Stalingrad. The huge
battle of Stalingrad which had raged from October through January, that means four
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 86
months, the Germans had lost and it was the first major military loss for the Germans.
And that made us unbelievably ecstatic. In fact, we decided that after that loss the war
can't last longer than next summer, meaning the summer of '43. I think it was that
optimism that made us keep going. We would have, if we would have known it would
last another over two years, I don't know whether, what we would have, I guess we had
no other choice anyway, but it kept our spirits up. Yeah, then the food situation. As I
had mentioned earlier also, food was rationed, the ration coupons were given out to
people who were registered with the police, see, the food rationing offices had actually a
duplicate of the police registration file. So obviously, since we were not registered with
the police, we couldn't get food ration cards and therefore, we had to buy all of our food
on the black market. The black market does not mean that there was actually a market
somewhere where people traded. I mean that would have been immediately, been
exploded by the Gestapo. Black market simply means that people were trading in
rationed food, but without ration coupons. Who were these people? Well, they were all
kinds of people. First of all, fellow underground Jews, you know for example, somebody
might have had a terrific source for baked goods and breads but nothing else, but that
person would then trade in breads and sell them at a profit for him and use that maybe to
buy a sausage from somebody else who had that source. And so there was, we knew of
quite a circle of underground Jews and so that was also a source for black market food.
Then various sympathetic gentiles, I had for example, a house maid of my maternal
grandparents, in fact my maternal grandmother died, fortunately a natural death, only a
few months before the deportations started. And her last maid, she had been with my
grandmother for many years and she was a very faithful family friend and she was the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 87
last one who could afford even to buy black market food, but she was a very modest and
simple person and she claimed she didn't even need all the food that she was getting on
her ration cards. So I went there, one of the stops that I did on my Berlin visits was her
little apartment and she always had some food, first of all she always fed me a warm meal
and then she also gave me something that she had saved from her rations. Then there was
the butcher of the Hesse family, near where they lived. Now, they were very decent
people, very strongly anti-Nazi and when they told them that they were going
underground, they immediately promised to supply them as much as they could with
meats. But the problem was they couldn't really go there because they were known in the
neighborhood, they lived around the corner there from that butcher and everybody knew
them. If they would appear there without a star, somebody would surely denounce them.
So before we actually went underground, I was introduced to them and as I had
mentioned earlier, we had lived, our family lived in a totally different part of Berlin. So
not a soul knew me there. So I was introduced, and there was also a ruse agreed upon
how I would go about getting food from her. But people were very jealous in those days
and so I would come into the store and say to her that my mother was in here this
morning and left an order for sausage and meat and gave you already the food stamps and
she would say yes, that's right, I have your order ready. Then she would go in the back
and pack us whatever she felt like up and charged me just the regular amount of money
for these items, which were all under price control. She could have, I should have said
earlier, on the black market roughly the price of food was 10 times the regular price
control price, it varied a little bit, it also depend on what kind of food, but that was a good
average. And she could have made a lot of money with that, instead she sold it to me
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 88
exactly at the price that was under price control and that was also purely, I mean, out of
support. And then another important item, incidentally, which people never think about,
is shoe repair. Not only were shoes rationed, but shoe repair was rationed. In other
words, if you needed a new sole, there was a ration coupon that you had to hand in for a
sole for a shoe and we didn't have that. Well, here our old shoemaker from our area had
agreed to support us and the thing was, he was actually a secret communist and, of
course, he was not active in the underground communist party, but he had been a
communist earlier and maintained his sympathies. And his shoe shop was not as close to
our old apartment as that butcher was to the Hesse's apartment, so I could go there
without fearing to run into anybody. So we had all our shoe repairs and that was, in the
long run, that was as much a life saver as food. What are you going to do if your shoes
fall apart, you can't get new shoes, you can't repair them, that basically condemns you to
stay at home, so we solved that problem with him. And then we had various other, I
mean there was a whole bunch of people who we relied on to obtain food and for the
money, as I said, we paid, I used the money gradually that I obtained from the assets of
my father that I talked about earlier.

Q: Let me ask you a question here. Was there any difficulty in figuring out which
people you could trust or not trust?

A: No, I mean the difficulty might have been in somebody whom I ran across sort of
unexpectedly somewhere, but the people that we had sort of contact with, we knew we
could trust.

Q: What about people you ran across, like old family friends?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 89
A: Yeah, I mean, Berlin was a city at that time still close to five million people, in a
sense even though New York is much bigger, it is also similar in the sense that you don't
run into people. Yeah, and of course, one thing, we had to be very careful where we
went. I mean, I never went into our old neighborhood and they never went into theirs.
And also then there were certain areas, I'll discuss that a little bit later, where sort of Jews
were sort of quote, known to be often and we tried to avoid these areas also. But there is
a possibility, I mean there was a possibility and you didn't trust anyone at all.

Q: What about in this village where you were living?

A: Yeah, okay, in the village, okay, that was a, I sort of said already how we concocted
our story there and we decided from the beginning then to just act like normal neighbors
and anything else would have been impossible anyway. So we actually started a whole
social life there, we met people and, you know, invited each other, we were invited, we
invited people for, I don't know, a game of cards or whatever. The most interesting
person actually we met, was the local Nazi party chieftain for that village. He, I mean
Margot's father, was a very good accordion player and he played often and I guess in
those cottages the walls are thin anyway, somehow that became known that he plays the
accordion and that Nazi, his name was Harry Gladenik, a very nice charming fellow, you
know. In spite of the fact that he was a rabid Nazi. He came over and said he heard that
here someone plays the accordion and he loves accordion music and they have actually
every Saturday evening, a party at his house with dancing and so on and why don't we
come over sort of sometime and participate in that. So we were frequent guests then at
the home of that Nazi, dancing with some of the women there and what was for me most
important, more important than the dancing at least, was the food. They had what
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 90
seemed to me limitless supplies of food there, I don't know what their sources were, but
part of the source, in fact, was the sister of Harry Gladenik, that Nazi. She lived with
them, but her husband who was also a real professional Nazi ideologue, was an official in
the German occupation of the Soviet Union and had his ways of obtaining meat and
sausages and all kinds of other goodies that were, even for good Germans, hard to get in
Germany. And he sent regular packages and so that was all served there and we always
enjoyed going there and had a wonderful time with these people.

Q: And when you went to these parties you felt comfortable?

A: Yeah, totally, I totally sort of divorced myself from my real self and chatted with
them and later on I think I felt sort of elation that, you know, that I was able to put up
such a front and, I mean this whole, in the beginning I changed, in the later part of the
war. In the beginning this whole life of deception sort of had some tremendous attraction
for me, now it sounds almost childish, but I felt somewhat like a secret agent in enemy
territory, trying to pretend something that wasn't the case and fooling all of the enemies.
Q: But there certainly is an element of risk there. Yes?

A: What element of risk was there anyway? I mean, but I mean after having lived by
that time, a year and a half before we went underground with the threat of deportation,
which was a constant risk and something that was out of my control even. I felt like a
free person there.

Q: Did anybody there know of your situation other than the person whose house it was?
A: No. Yeah, and she wasn't really known too well. She had just bought it a year before
and was a few times, so yeah, she obviously knew us, but no, nobody else knew us.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 91
Q: During this period, were you in contact with other Jewish people who had gone
underground?

A: Yeah, right. There was one fellow actually, he was an interesting fellow,
unfortunately I lost contact with him after the war, his name was Heinz Jacobius. He was
the most versatile person, underground Jew, that I encountered. He lived in the middle of
the city with an Aryan girlfriend and of course, he also was not registered and in the city
it was even more complicated than in the country where we were because the janitors of
buildings sort of had, they were legally obligated to see to it that every tenant was
registered with the police. In fact, he had to countersign the registration form that one
had to fill out. And if somebody, you know, regularly comes by, the janitor is supposed
to watch out so they were somewhat like spies also, they're supposed to notice that and
report that person. But that Heinz Jacobius, he was a tremendous black market artist and
he just fed that janitor so well that he surely had no interest in killing the goose that laid
his golden eggs. Yeah, and actually he was, and then his house was hit by incendiary
bombs during an air raid. And, of course, that scared him because if that house would
have burned down, then you know, that would have sort of destroyed the whole
arrangement. And during wartime, incidentally, the fire department, and that was made
known also, did never, never did anything to protect or put out fires in ordinary apartment
houses because they were needed for more important objects, you know, either
government or military installations and so on and so the whole population had been
trained in extinguishing fires. And he apparently distinguished himself, went out of his
way in I don't know, whatever he did, that anyway, the local party organization gave him
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 92
a special sort of order of merit that people got for going out of their way and beyond the
call of duty in putting out the fire, which they did.
Q: The reason I asked you about your knowledge of other Jews who had gone
underground is, I was wondering whether there was any sort of informal network for
information purposes, for any sort of political or sabotage purposes or anything else.
A: No. I mean, there was what you might call an informal network. I knew some and
then others knew some others, but it had nothing to do, in other words, with any attempt
even at sabotage. We were totally devoted to only surviving and not being caught. I
mean sabotage would have endangered us even more.
Q: But what about access to information?
A: Yeah, well that's what that served, but on the other hand, you had to be very careful if
you, I'm coming to something that I haven't mentioned yet, but the Gestapo employed a
number of Jewish spies and if you met a Jew whom you had not seen sort of on a more or
less continuous basis, you didn't know whether that person was legitimately underground,
like I was, or whether that was a spy working for the Gestapo and ready to hand me over.
So, for that reason, one, the unwritten law was, first of all you did not disclose to anyone
where you lived. And secondly, if you met somebody, say just on the street, from earlier
times, you would try to avoid that person.

End of side one of tape four.
Q: This is tape four, side B of an interview with Ernest Fontheim. It is March 13, 1997.
The interviewer is Randy Goldman.
A: Another important aspect of our stay there was the total change in lifestyle. I mean, I
was even in the apartment where we were forced into in the Jewish house. It was still,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 93
you know, we had running water, we had running toilet, water toilets, even running hot
water, central heating and all these amenities. And suddenly from one day to the next,
transformed, transferred into that primitive cottage, was a tremendous, I don't know if
culture shock as far as the wrong word, sort of a living style shock would be probably
better. We had to, as I said, get our water from a pump outside and we learned that if it
freezes, then the pump freezes and you had to do all kinds of shenanigans to unfreeze the
pump, like pouring hot water through a priming hole. We had, of course obviously, no
water toilet, but an outhouse which was very primitive and in winter very cold. And, as I
also said, there was of course no electricity. We had, for a lot of money we had to buy
petroleum on the black market to run the one petroleum lamp and also had candles for
which we had to pay a lot of money. And so it was a total change in lifestyle and I found
that at the time, very romantic and felt that living in a big city apartment house with
running water and central heating made us only degenerate and now at least these
horrible times had one advantage, they make us sort of return to nature and so that we
really appreciate what is heat. Heat is not just some pipes that radiate heat, but in our
case, wood had to be cut with an ax and was hard work and that's how you create your
heat. And water had to be obtained from a pump and sometimes you had to unfreeze it
and I remember at that time I was very romantic about all of this and thought that was a
great thing that was happening to me that I was returning to nature in some form. Okay,
yeah, I had mentioned earlier also, these so-called black accounts that my father had with
various people. Now it turned out that the black market prices were continuously
increasing, there was an inflation even in the black market and so I was aware of the fact,
you know, a fixed sum of money sort of would shrink in purchasing power over the years
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 94
and I wanted to avoid that. So, the money which I had with that former client furrier,
client of my father, I decided to invest in something that would keep its value at least for,
or would increase with inflation, thereby keeping its purchasing power. And through a
friend I had the opportunity to buy a women's sort of evening handbag made out of sort
of high carat gold and platinum, little elements sort of like in a chain. And for that
handbag I paid twelve thousand Reichsmark and then I gave it back to the furrier because
I didn't want to have it for fear, you know, something happens and so he kept it. But he
also offered me to do some work on his estate. He had a fantastic estate outside of
Berlin, east of Berlin in a very fancy area with big mansions and he said he needed
anyway some workers and if I came, he would feed me for that day and pay me also and
in addition, he also dealt on a large scale in black market, there would be always some
things that he could give me along. So once a week, I went out to his estate. Now on that
estate, he had actually three workers already. One was a Polish couple, they were real
peasants and in fact he detailed me sort of to that Polish guy and he told me what to do.
And his wife was | think sort of a cleaning woman in his house. And then he had a single
Polish girl, a young woman, her name was Maria and she was the cook and also sort of
homemaker. And incidentally, I have to add that he had all these workers was only a
result of his connections. As I said earlier, he supplied Goring with furs, because
according to the law at that time, forced foreign laborers could be used only in either
agriculture or defense plants. And agriculture meant not for the people, you know,
people for their own back yards as he did, but agriculture in the sense these were
suppliers of food for the population. So he was legally not entitled to them but had them
anyway. But I mean the German, the system under the Nazis was shot through with
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 95
corruption and anyone could get anything he wanted. I mean, incidentally, the film
Schindler's List is an excellent example how Schindler, even in Auschwitz with a number
of diamonds, gets his workers out of the concentration camp again. So I went, as I said, I
went there once a week and worked under the supervision of that Polish peasant and that
peasant, he talked German haltingly but fairly well, and he was obsessed because he was
a great Polish patriot and he was obsessed with, I mean with the terrible fate of Poland.
And in his theory, the cause for the terrible fate of Poland, it had two causes. One was
the communists or the Soviets and the other one was the Jews. The Germans, for some
reason, never occurred to him, even though they were the ones to attack Poland. And so I
had to listen to his antisemitic tirades and sort of appear to agree with him. And another
aspect, there was that Maria, the maid, every time when I was ready to leave, she called
me to her room to give me some food and also something to eat right there and something
to take along. And I was convinced that she must sort of be secretly in love with me, but
I didn't want to have anything to do with her, I mean for many reasons. First of all, I
wasn't attracted to her and secondly, I felt any involvement of that kind can only be
dangerous. - One of the other underground friends, we had a whole circle of people who
were underground, not a circle in the sense that we actually lived together, but we kept in
touch with each other, and one of them was a fellow from my high school graduating
class. His name was Gerd Cohn. He lived also with a non-Jewish girlfriend and he had
all kinds of contacts also for black market foods and necessities. And one day he told me
that he met a group of foreign forced laborers who were a tremendous source of black
market food. And in fact, there was a plan somewhere to illegally slaughter a pig and sell
it off right away. And he asked me, he had to, he was going there, he had to commit
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 96
himself, however, to a given amount of pounds of meat and I discussed it at home and I
gave him a certain order, I forgot what it was, X number of pounds and, incidentally, the
listener will from that, I guess, gather that I don't eat kosher which is true. I never did eat
kosher and actually I always enjoyed ham, but at that point we didn't even have the
luxury of being very choosy. Anyway to make a long story short, on the day, on the
appointed day when I was supposed to come to pick up the meat, his girlfriend was in
hysterics. He didn't come back, and the next day he didn't come back either. And of
course, there was no way, where do you go to find out? Now, this under, other
underground Jewish friend of mine whom I had mentioned earlier, Heinz Jacobius, who
you know also did all kinds of things in the underground, he even, he had some sort of a
line, I didn't know what it was, to the Gestapo where he could find out things and I asked
him to make some inquiries whether this Gerd Cohn ever appeared. The thing is here, all
Jews who were arrested for deportation ultimately wound up in the transit camp. And he
made those inquiries and there was no Gerd Cohn ever appeared there. So it was clear
that he must have been the victim of a crime and there was actually a German newspaper
article that, about two weeks later or so, that a torso with the head missing and the hands
missing and these would be the identifiers, the hands, because of fingerprints and
obviously the head because of the facial features, was found floating in the river. Oh
yeah, and it was, the article mentioned a certain scar, I forgot from some operation, and
friends of his knew that he had such a scar. So apparently, he must have had some
horrible fate and the suspicion was that these foreign laborers, apparently you know, he
had first of all, a large amount of money with him to purchase that large amount of meat
that he had ordered, and in addition to that, he had some excellent forged ID which could
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 97
always be re-forged into a different name or a different picture, and maybe other things
that were of value to those guys, so the opinion among people who knew him and the
circumstances was that he was, that this was a trap, there never was a pig and that he was
murdered. That he was lured into that trap and lost his life that way, a horrible fate.

Q: Let me ask you something. Since you have mentioned a few minutes ago that most
people who were arrested went initially to the transit camp.

A: Yeah.

Q: Were there random crimes or murders by the SS or against Jews, or was it all done
very, in an organized fashion for deportation?

A: No, actually, no that's a good question. The Germans somehow abhor sort of random
violence. In fact the Kristallnacht even, which was a case of random violence, was
criticized within the Nazi circles very much and in fact actually, at a ministerial meeting,
a cabinet meeting two days afterwards, Goring severely criticized, I think Goebbels was
mainly behind that, because of all the destruction. It turned out that the kind of glass that
is used for shop windows was, at that time was a glass that was not even made in
Germany, they had to buy it in Belgium, that means they had to use foreign exchange and
then Géring turned to Goebbels and said, you could have, it would have been better if
you would have killed a few more hundred Jews rather than cause all of that destruction
which now we have to, you know, so they are, anyway to come back specifically to your
question, that process was very orderly. The Jew was arrested, he was put into that camp
until enough people were together to put together a transport and then they were shipped
off. I mean, they may have been beaten up maybe in some sadistic urge by some SS
men, but...
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 98
Q: But this isn't like in camps or in ghettos where if you said something wrong you could
have been shot? This didn't really happen in Berlin?

A: No. I mean, if you did something wrong, yeah, I mean, they had a bunker there
which was a sort of a nickname for a part of the basement, I think it was only four feet
high and only a few square feet, people were put in as punishment. Particularly if there
were escape attempts, that sort of thing. But they were not shot sort of randomly like you
saw in the film Schindler's List, that was not, they were always shipped for orderly
killing. Let me see, yeah, I had mentioned already that if one met some Jewish person in
the underground whom one hadn't seen for a long time, the initial reaction was always to
be suspicious. I'm coming now probably to the saddest chapter of the underground, and
these are the Jewish catchers or spies. The Gestapo kept a sort of a small herd of them
and they operated also out of the transit camp. Incidentally, the transit camp had shifted
in the meantime. It was no longer in the old age home, I think the old age home was then
used for other governmental purposes. The transit camp was shifted to the Jewish
hospital of Berlin, which was then the last place, I mean sort of Jewish owned building in
the city. And a part of, one wing of the hospital was turned over to the Gestapo to
maintain the transit camp. And the spies also had their rooms in that transit camp and
they lived there, but they could come and go as they wanted, of course, and more
importantly, they obviously didn't wear the yellow star as they normally would have had
to. And their task was to track down Jews, other Jews who were underground. And the
sad story is that first of all, they were incredibly more effective than the Gestapo because
the Gestapo basically in tracking down a Jew, was sort of like a blind person trying to
find something, they had really nothing to go by. While the spies, all of them had
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 99
themselves been underground and had then been caught and they knew many of the tricks
and trades of underground Jews. They knew where to go to and so on and they had a
much better nose, plus many of them, of course, knew other underground Jews anyway
and would just give those names to the Gestapo. Now the most notorious of these was a
woman, her maiden name was Stella Goldschlag, and unfortunately, I knew her fairly
well. She worked part of the time that I was at Siemens, she also worked for Siemens.

At that time, she was married to a man whose last name was Kiibler, so then her name
was Stella Kiibler. Stella was a strikingly beautiful woman, she was tall, slender, had
long golden blond locks, wavy hair and blue eyes and a very pretty face. She, at Siemens
also, she was sort of the center of attention. I came to know her, even though she was not
in my department but in a different one, in fact she was in the same department where
some members of the Baum group, this underground Jewish communist group, were
working that I had mentioned earlier. But, in my class in the orthodox school that I went
to in the '30's was a boy named Klaus Goldschlag, in fact I remembered him very well, he
was the top student in our class. And I know he left and emigrated to Canada. And
Goldschlag is not exactly a common name, so when I met her first, I asked her whether
she is related to him and then she said, yeah, that's her cousin, and so we talked several
times about him and then also sometimes about other things. But otherwise, I had not
much in common with her, I don't think she had any, to my knowledge, any intellectual
interests or music interests and the circles that I sort of circulated in, she surely did not
belong to. But, through the mouth radio, sometime in the, maybe mid-'43, I heard that
she is working for the Gestapo as a catcher and that really scared me. And in fact, I know
that at one point, I almost encountered her. What happened was the following thing.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 100
Even in walking around in Berlin, I developed various strategies to avoid being
recognized and one was, in a big city of course, there is a lot of pedestrian traffic, you
know, people walking this way, people walking that way, and when I walked down a
street, I would look at the faces of the people, not who would just be in front of me, but
three or four people down behind them, so that I would, could possibly recognize others
before I was recognized by them. That was one, the other strategy was that I always had
a handkerchief at hand and if some real emergency arose, I would pretend to have to
blow my nose, but in such a way that I covered most of my face with my handkerchief
and wouldn't be recognizable that way. So one day I was walking down a street, I even
remember the name, Pfalzburger Strasse, and I saw, again looking back several people
beyond the one that immediately faced me and I saw what seemed to be Stella. I couldn't
100% identify her, but I, obviously I didn't want to take a chance, you know, to get closer
to her. I immediately decided turning around and running away would be the worst thing
to do and I was lucky, just at that point where I recognized her, I passed a store, so I just
went into the store pretending, I remember it was a green grocer, so he had potatoes,
vegetables, things like that. And I turned my back to the window and pretending to look
at various items in the store. For awhile the saleswoman or probably the owner, already
asked me what I wanted and I said, well, I just want to see what you have and so on and
then after quite a while, after she must have long passed, I sort of excused myself and
looked out and she was gone. I mean, there has been a book written about her and she
has really caused the death of many people. Now, she was after the war then tried in a
German court, well first she was tried by the Russians who everybody hoped would just
finish her off, instead they gave her just a 10-year sentence from '46 to '56. Then she
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 101
reappeared and then there was an unbelievable clamor that for her to be put away. And
then the Germans meticulously said, well, a person cannot be tried for the same crime
twice, but there were in the meantime, many other arrests that she made which had not
been covered by the Soviet trial and so she was then tried for those cases and then she
was found guilty and the judge gave her another 10 years, but applying the 10 years that
she already served under the Soviets, she was immediately set free. And it is known that
she lives now under an assumed name somewhere in West Germany. That is something,
that is some of the worst, she should have been done away with, preferably hanged
immediately after the war. Supposedly after some research that other people did, she is
guilty of hundreds of lives that she gave over to the Gestapo.

Q: Let me ask you a few questions here. Were you, do you think that while you were
working together at Siemens that she was involved in this kind of activity?

A: No, not at all.

Q: It was later?

A: It was later, yeah.

Q: What sorts of stories did you hear at the time about what she was doing? What kinds
of things was she doing?

A: Well, I mean, what she was doing was to walk around Berlin and she knew where
Jews were likely to go and, for example, it became known that a very safe place was, of
all places, the Berlin State Opera. And the Gestapo would never bother with that and
most Jews, they were music lovers, so you could have a pleasant evening even, listening
to good music and be safe. The problem was that Stella knew that, too. So she appeared
there one day and arrested a whole family of, a sort of middle aged couple and a teenage
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 102
son or something. You know, that was exactly the, and she would pull, she had a small
revolver that she would pull on people if they didn't exactly, and then one person tried to
run away and she shouted, stop him, it's a Jew, and there were some men that grabbed
that person.

Q: You knew her a little bit, what motivated her to do such evil things? What was it
about her, what was she like?

A: What was about her was self preservation, I mean that's how she survived the war, I
mean by having others killed. Now, she claimed after the war also that she did it mainly
to protect her parents. Yeah, well, she had a bargain initially with the Gestapo and SS
official who commanded that transit camp. And the bargain was that her parents could
stay also, they got a room there and they could stay there with her, she was an only child.
And then at some point, I forgot when that was, I think late '43 or maybe early '44, the
Gestapo told her that they can't protect the parents any longer and then she managed to
have them transported to Theresienstadt, that was the only, instead of to Auschwitz, but
they were then transferred later to Auschwitz. I mean, the parents are sort of a tragic
thing, they can't be blamed for what the daughter did, but she maintained her own life
that way by killing others. Now, there were many other people, a good friend of mine,
Ismar Reich, who was underground and was caught. And he was immediately offered
freedom if he could name some others and he simply refused. And he said he wasn't
even beaten, I mean he refused, fine, you don't want to, fine, you go to Auschwitz. Now,
he was a very clever resourceful guy. He was with some friends there and somehow they
succeeded in smuggling some tools with them and then while the train rolled, they started
to saw, you know, they, these freight trains are basically wooden siding, they sawed some
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 103
planks off and when the train slowed down somewhere they jumped out and saved
themselves that way.

Q: Were there a great number of these catchers?

A: I mean, too many probably. I don't know how many, but maybe 10, 15 or so.

Q: But you knew of others?

A: Yeah, oh yeah, there were others, too. Maybe this is a point where I might indicate
an incident that we had. We decided that in the long run it may not be safe if we stay just
at that one point all the time. So we decided we ought to look for a sort of substitute
place in case we have to leave. So I contacted, I'm not sure whether I mentioned that, or
maybe I did, my father's, one of his clients were members of the Hohenzollern family, it
was actually the sister-in-law of the last German Kaiser and her son and they had an
estate sort of half way Berlin, between Berlin and Potsdam, a suburb which used to be the
summer residence of Prussian kings. And she was, they were very good friends of our
family and we made an appointment and Margot, her mother and I went there and
discussed and I knew, apparently, something that she had separate servants quarters
somewhere and I discussed with her, you know, the possibility whether there might be
some place for us to spend maybe not long periods, but maybe a week or so at a time.
And it was somewhat inconclusive and so on, I mean she also had to be careful,
obviously, so on the way back from there, that estate was off a sort of a country road
connecting Berlin and Potsdam and where a bus only came, I don't know, once every
hour, if that much. And we decided, we knew when the bus was coming and that maybe
there was another half hour left or so and there was a little country inn and we did have
also illegally obtained ration coupons, so why don't we go in and maybe have a piece of
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 104
cake and a cup of coffee and talk there. So we went in and Margot's mother immediately,
there was a revolving door I remember, you know you go through the revolving door and
then you walk in. She instead of walking in, right away revolved back out and, you
know, that immediately rang a bell. So I didn't ask any questions and Margot not either.
We immediately revolved out and then the mother said that there was a couple sitting that
she knew, they are Jews, she don't know, she doesn't know, you know, what their
background, who they are, but one has to be careful. So we walked out and then walked
along and decided maybe to walk to the next bus stop in order not to wait right in front
there. And as we walked, and we walked fairly briskly, we heard sort of footsteps
coming from behind, closing in, and it was the man. And he said, he saw us come in and
he had the impression maybe we were afraid of him, but there was no reason, we
shouldn't be afraid, he is himself in hiding and we should just feel free to come in. That
of course, was a giveaway already. No Jew at that time would have told somebody else
whom he hadn't known, like he didn't even know me, you know, that he was in hiding.
He should have been mistrustful of me as I would have been of him. Anyway, he sort of
implored us to come back and we just refused and as an excuse we gave that we
discovered that we are actually late, we have to get back to Berlin to meet somebody or
some excuse like that and we were walking to the next bus stop. Yeah, and the man then
gave up and returned to the restaurant where there was actually the previous bus stop was
there and we were hurrying up because it was already getting the time for the bus to come
and we were still some distance away from the next bus stop when we saw the bus
coming and so we sort of speeded up but never made it. But as the bus passed us, in
those days busses were not closed, where you entered it was sort of open and there was
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 105
an open platform at the back. And as the bus passed us, we saw that man standing in that
bus. So then it was obvious that he was trying to follow us and was trying to take the
same bus with us. So we were glad we didn't make it to the next stop, instead after the
bus had cleared there, we walked off the, this country road and there was a forest. Now, I
had the basic map of Berlin fairly well in my head, we didn't have a map along because it
didn't occur to us that we needed one. But I knew that in the direction if we walked, that
was walking east from there, just through forests, I mean it may have been several miles,
we would come to a suburban sort of commuter line where we could catch a train because
we were sure that if we would take the next bus, he would have alerted police at the next
suburban station for that line which was actually Wannsee. And so that's what we did.
We walked for hours through the forest roughly sort of keeping in the direction until we
came to that suburban line which was a totally different line and there we boarded the
train and got back. But such incidents, I mean of that kind, happened fairly frequently.
Another incident that just occurred to me now, was, for heating our stove of course, we
bought firewood which was expensive and even some coal and in addition to that, I went
and collected sort of dead wood branches from the forest around that village there. And
for that, even for that one needed a official permission of the Forestry Department. | still
have that, it's sort of almost like a joke, it permits the bearer, Giinther Hesse, that was my
name then, to collect dead branches that are lying on the floor. But of course, I didn't
confine myself to dead branches, I often just broke off live branches and even small trees
and we would then sort of hack them into pieces and let them dry out before using them
in our oven. The problem was that I was once observed by the forester and but he didn't
stop me, I never saw him even and he didn't stop me and so I didn't know that I was
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 106
observed. But one of the settlers in our settlement was a good friend of his and he, and
the forester told him that he noticed that I was violating the law and taking live branches
and he would have to report me. Now basically, that was probably a, you know, a kind of
offense was a little fine, but the problem was if it was reported, I didn't exist legally and
that would have immediately endangered our existence there. So, but we had a
tremendous source for cigarettes. Cigarettes were of course rationed. Margot's father was
a chain smoker and so he spent a lot of his money on cigarettes and he went to that other
settler and told him again a lie story, I mean the story was that if I got fined for that, then
my military exemption will immediately be taken away from me and I will be shipped to
the eastern front and by that time the eastern front was by everyone considered sort of
like a death sentence and people had sort of understanding for that. And if he can do
something about it, you know, we will supply the necessary cartons of cigarettes and the
forester had a certain price, I forgot what it was, several cartons, and of course, the guy
had to get his cut, too. And in this way we avoided that I was, you know, cited for that
offense of taking live branches. Then another incident occurred once in splitting wood
with our ax. We didn't really have a proper base for splitting wood, but just sort of a
relatively soft wood stump and once when I sort of apparently hit the wood that I wanted
to split particularly hard, I split not only the wood but also the stump and the ax went
right into my foot at my ankle. And there was a really big open wound which obviously,
first of all, needed to be sewn up and secondly also, probably my bone would have to be
x-rayed in case the bone was damaged. So one of the neighbors who had a car drove me
to the nearest hospital and then there was, of course, first we are afraid if they say I have
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 107
to stay overnight then again, there was a need for identification and so on, so I was
x-rayed and fortunately, they discovered that the bone wasn't damaged.

End of tape four.

Tape 5

Q: This is tape number five, side A of an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 13,
1997, the interviewer is Randy Goldman.
A: So all that needed to be done was to sew up the wound and send me home, I thought.
But Margot's father was with me, we were in a sort of a holding area and a nurse
approached with a needle and he knew something, I mean Margot's father, that I wasn't
aware of, namely that after such an injury one needs a tetanus shot. And the tetanus shot
is given into a person's rear end and so he knew immediately they would ask me to lower
my pants and that would surely have been a 100% give-away to anyone in Germany who
I really was, once they would have discovered my circumcision. So he had a quick
presence of mind and I was lying on a stretcher and he turned me around on my belly and
then pulled my pants off before the nurse could get to me so | got the shot into my rear
end and nobody saw anything else of me. And then I was sewn up and since hospitals
anyway were short of beds, obviously because of the large demands for wounded
soldiers, they were glad that I didn't have to stay and we were glad that I didn't have to
stay for different reasons. I also want to mention a cousin of mine, he was actually the
son of the couple where we stayed in that apartment in the Jew house. He was several
years older than I, he was by that time, I would guess, in his mid or late 30's, I was just 20
or 21 then, and he lived with his girlfriend, Bella Ritter. His name was Albert Marck.
And Bella Ritter's husband had already been arrested and had been for years in a
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 108
concentration camp and she lived now with my cousin and they decided to go
underground in Bavaria and he told me that before they left, that he considered Berlin too
dangerous. Of course he had lived there much longer also as an adult, and they had
figured out a way, apparently, that they thought was foolproof. And that was that he had
some medical sort of statements from doctors that he was suffering from some lung
disease which required his recuperation in the country. And then he had some ID, I
guess, on the name that matched it and so did his woman friend. And we decided we
wanted to keep in touch, of course, and that was a big problem because he was planning
sort of to move around from different sanatoriums, and I didn't want to give anyone my
address. So the solution was that is something that can be done in Germany, I don't know
whether that exists here, you can address a letter to somebody under a code name at
general delivery at a given post office. I still remember my code was the letter F like in
Fontheim, 58, F58 and at a particular post office in Berlin. I mean that was also a risky
thing because if somehow he had been found by the Gestapo with such a letter, they
could have waited for me there, but I guess one did all kinds of stupid things. So
anyway, we corresponded in that way and then one day the correspondence stopped and
then I got a letter from Bella, his friend, that something happened to him and he is very
sick and she is returning to Berlin alone. So that immediately told me that he was
arrested. It was a big tragedy actually because what happened she told, we met in Berlin
and she told me that he, apparently there were some questions raised at the place where
they were staying, but they were still able to get away, but they left all of their assets, I
mean that they had to carry with them always, certain valuables, I don't know what they
were, but what they needed to sustain their life. And he said he had to go back quickly to
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 109
retrieve these things and she had warned him and tried to keep him from doing it. His
point was that without the assets, how can they even continue living and she felt
somehow they will make it. Anyway, the result was that he went back and never
returned. So obviously he walked into a trap there. So she was now alone in Berlin. We
kept in touch. We saw each other periodically and when the time came that, she
mentioned to me several times that she had a very good friend who is a jeweler and I
needed some money from that furrier where I had converted all of the money into that
ladies evening handbag and so I wanted to sell it. And she said that man gives very good
prices and so on. Anyway my first intent was not even to sell it immediately, but just to
get it appraised. So I gave the handbag to her and we were then agreed to meet the next
day and she would bring the handbag back and the appraisal price from her jeweler
friend. Well, guess what, she never appeared there. I couldn't believe that she would
cheat me out of that handbag, I mean that was just incredible. And as I found out shortly
thereafter, she didn't. The problem was Stella Goldschlag. It turned out that Stella
actually transferred from Siemens where she worked and where I had met her to a
different factory for some reason and at that factory Bella had worked, so they knew each
other. And apparently, Bella must have run into Stella and got snatched away and she
was arrested, transported to Auschwitz and never came back.

Q: Can I ask you something here? Was a there a different feeling about being betrayed
by fellow Jews than there was by being arrested and deported by the Nazis?

A: Totally. I mean, as absurd as it may sound, but that's what I expected from the
Gestapo to do, if they arrest me that they would deport me. But for a Jew to do that, to
turn on other Jews that was such an unbelievable act of betrayal that, I mean it just, I
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 110
mean if you ask any Jew who lived underground in Berlin, whether they knew her or not,
she was, everybody knew her by name at least, there is not one that I can think of who
would excuse her or even say that she should have gotten anything less than execution
after the war. I mean, she just didn't deserve to live, her life is based on the lives of
hundreds of people who are not alive anymore because of her. I mean, to think of it even
now still drives me crazy that she is alive and she has apparently a pleasant life and has
some sort of a government pension. Yeah, one thing, I have to back up a little bit, on the
27th of February, 1943, that was just about a little bit less than a month after we went
underground, remember we went underground on the 30th of January, '43. On the 27th
of February, the SS made a general sweep of all factories which employed Jews under
extremely brutal conditions. The 27th of February, of course, was a winter day and it
was a cold day, the Gestapo simply collected the Jews without giving them the
opportunity to go back to their dressing rooms to pick up their outerwear, coats or
whatever they had, they were just like that taken to various transit camps that had been
readied for that because the regular transit camp, obviously, wouldn't have taken the
thousands and thousands of people. And then they were shipped out in a series of
transports in the first week of March, 1943. After that, Berlin was essentially
"judenrein". It's a tragedy because, I mean it's a tragedy for everyone, but I also have to
think back again at my good friend, Hans Fabisch, who had hoped that he was safe
working in a factory. Well, he himself wasn't safe anyway, but even if he would not have
been arrested on that day, it was the 18th of January, '43, he would have been arrested a
little bit later and without announcement. None of these people knew it and, incidentally,
Stella Goldschlag, in that factory, she was smart enough when the Jews were herded
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 111
down, apparently nobody thought of sort of bringing up the rear and she stayed back, she
worked there, by the way, with her mother, she and her mother stayed back and walked
slower and then ducked into one of the ladies restrooms and then left at the end of the
shift, at the end of the day when thousands of workers sort of streamed out of the factory
gate and that way they escaped being deported on that day. And then they went
underground and then sometime later, she was caught, actually by another catcher for the
Gestapo.

Q: Do you want to just, I know this is jumping forward, but because we're talking about
Stella, I understand she was caught after the war. How did that come about?

A: That is all explained, a book was written about her. I mean, she wasn't caught, I mean
she voluntarily went to the Jewish community to get papers as a victim of fascism and to
take advantage of, you know, many of the sort of restitution measures that were then
taken or given to the Jews. And she, I mean that was an unbelievable act of naiveté, how
she could have thought to get away with it. I ought to say one other thing, you know
there were Jews also during the years when Jews were deported and picked up, there
were Jews who picked up other Jews, like my parents were picked up by Jews, that can't
be compared to what Stella did. Because these Jews picked up Jews who were not in
hiding, who were basically, you might say, at the disposal of the Gestapo, I mean the
Gestapo knew where they were and they could have picked them up. It is true those Jews
made life easier for the Gestapo, but nobody believes that the Gestapo would have given
up the Holocaust or the murdering of the German Jews even, if these Jewish orderlies
would have refused the pickup. I know that quite a number of authors, even Raul Hilberg
and particularly Hannah Arendt, have criticized very strongly the collaboration by Jews
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 112
in the deportation process, and not only in Berlin, but in the Eastern ghettos and in other
places. However, I think each case has to be judged individually and many of these
orderlies were simply not given any choice. They had a tragic task to fulfill. Similar, in
fact, you can compare it to the so-called "Sonderkommandos", or special commandos, in
the concentration camp. These were the Jews who serviced the gas chambers and the
crematoria and extracted gold teeth from the corpses and so on. They could have refused
and would have been shot probably, and the Gestapo still would have, or the SS over
there, would have obtained everything they wanted to obtain. In the case of Stella, these
were people who otherwise in all likelihood, would have survived the war. So it is a
totally different thing and I want in the strongest terms, in moral terms, to make a strong
difference between her actions and the actions of the orderlies who had that tragic task to
pick up Jews for deportation.

Beginning Tape Six, Side A
Question: This is a continuation of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997.
This is tape one, side A. For the record, why don't we begin again with your stating your name,
date of birth and city of birth, if you don't mind.
Answer: Well, my name is, my full name is Ernest Gundolf Fontheim. I was born on October 23,
1922, in Berlin, Germany. I might add that my father was a lawyer, he was born in 1881, so he
was already over 40 years old when I was born and he was one of the best known lawyers in
Berlin. And I grew up in a -- very comfortably and in a very assimilated home, assimilated to
German culture and with very little awareness of my Judaism.
Q: Okay. Do you want to pick up where we left off before?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 113
A: Yeah. I would -- I would like to say that the transition from -- to the life underground,
underground meaning simply with forged papers and under a different identity, meant of course
for me also, a radical transition in family. My parents had just been arrested and deported and
now I| am living -- I was living with a completely different family and the family atmosphere was
totally different. While my parents were both actually highly educated and very intellectual, the
family of Margaret and her parents, family Haas, were on the other hand -- I mean Mr. Haas was
a -- a tailor and designer of women's clothes and -- and actually had owned a factory be -- until
the Nazis took it away from him. He was a man who was much more folksy than my parents, had
a tremendous sense of humor and was a very warm person. And of course there were frictions
now and then. I guess that is always unavoidable, but in -- in general, I felt comfortable and of
course also grateful that I was accepted, practically as a family member by this new family. Also,
another big difference was the age difference. As I said, my father was actually quite old and for
a boy of my age -- I mean, my mother was 10 years younger than he, but Margaret's parents
were, they were both of the same age, 20 years younger than my father and 10 years younger
than my mother and I think that also made a difference in -- in the relationship.

Q: What kind of difference are we talking about in terms of your rapport with them?

A: In -- in, to some extent, in terms of rapport and then also in -- in terms of how they took life. I
mean also, I have to say that my fa -- my parents had gone through unbelievable agony, I mean
starting in 1933. Probably to some extent, they took it much harder. They surely lost much more,
because they had more to lose. They were, in those 10 years, starting in 1933, they were robbed
of all of their possessions, everything that my father had worked for and also their social
standing and everything had been taken away from them. And by the time that the deportation
started, they were totally devastated and -- and the atmosphere therefore at home, also was
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 114
always -- ho-how can I describe it? I mean morbid, maybe and -- and -- and just extremely ne-
negative. While, in -- in spite of all the hardships, Margaret's parents, first of all because they
were younger and secondly because, I guess, they didn't go quite through the same amount of
tremendous radical turmoil and change, had retained their sense of humor and also their, sort of
some sense of ad-adventurism and -- and so on. And I-I-I think to that extent, I-I felt comfortable
there, in spite of the fact that the lot of my parents and my sister continued to be a -- a
tremendous weight, I mean I-I -- by that time of course, I always hoped that they'll be in some
camp and -- which will be liberated at some point in the future.

Q: So you have -- it was -- it was a more fun atmosphere?

A: Well, funner -- well yeah, I mean to some extent that is also true, we -- for example, we -- we
had brought along a -- a phonograph player, we played records, both classical as well as dance
music. I didn't know how to dance and so Margaret, who was an excellent or is still -- is an
excellent dancer, taught me how to dance and -- and -- and yeah, as I said, ther-there was a
certain amount of -- of -- of -- of humor and -- and -- and also light-heartedness. And of course,
that went together with the fact that I and none of us, in fact, was wearing the yellow star any
more, which made us outcasts. We felt sort of, at least I felt liberated by that and I mean all of
that contributed to a -- to a -- a more positive mental outlook. In addition, I want to say that we
tried to keep as much as possible, the Jewish holidays. I don't remember any more, how we even
knew the dates, we surely didn't have any Jewish calendars, there were none printed in Germany.
But we did know, for example, when Yom Kippur was and we fasted on it. We did know when
Pesach, the date was and we even kept the ornamental Seder. Margaret's father, who was in
general an excellent cook and -- and baker, baked some approximation of a matzo, which we ate
and of course we didn't even have a Haggadah, but we talked about the exodus from Egypt, just
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 115
from out of our memory. I did have a handwritten copy of the Kiddush and so every Friday
evening, we lit candles and made Kiddush. If we didn't have wine, we used some other liquid,
whatever came handy, even if it had to be water. And -- and if we didn't have two candles, we
cu-cut one candle into two. And I derived a lot of strength, I think from the -- the fact, I mean, of
the Jewish religion and that was actually one important pillar of -- of strength I had. Looking
back, there were three pillars of strength. One was my Judaism, the second was my unshakable
trust in the future. I had almost certainty that Germany would lose the war, even at a time when
Germany was -- still seemed to be winning. And in fact I had taken along some books. I had
already decided to study physics later. I took a book for self teaching of calculus along, which I
worked through from cover to cover in those years. And I had a physics book, which I studied.
Every week I located some time to do that. And -- and in addition to that, by the way, we -- there
was in -- in a local, bigger town, there was a public library, which we joined, of course, under
our assumed names and so we checked books out, novels and other things and -- and I already
said that we played music, so we -- we tried to maintain as normal an atmosphere a-as possible.
So -- and -- and incidentally, I -- and in fact, none of the four of us ever had the intention, after
the end of the war, to stay one day longer in Germany than absolutely necessary and we had, at
that time already, always dreamt about coming to America. That was sort of a dream, like --
almost like a castle in the sky. And so it -- it was the Judaism and my trust in the future are the
two. The third pillar of strength was actually Margaret, as I had indicated earlier, I had at one
time, in -- in the -- during -- while we -- while we were still working at the factory at Zeemens,
started to fall in love with Margot, only to hear that she had a -- a -- a steady boyfriend, but by
that time, I-I-I forgot what happened to the boyfriend, I think he also went underground, actually
and anyway, he -- he was not available and there was no contact and so my interest in Margot
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 116
was of course rekindled and at that time, finally, it was reciprocated. And -- and actually she was
the person really closest to me and -- who gave me much of the inner strength also. She was sort
of the third leg in that -- what -- what kept me going, emotionally I mean, mentally going. I
should also say that, one thing that I was not aware of at that time, but that -- was the arrest of
my friend Huntz, which I had mentioned earlier. All people that I had known in my earlier life,
were gone. Some of them of course had emigrated, the rest had been deported. There was
nobody from my immediate family, my first girlfriend, school friends, factory friends, you name
it. Relatives, there was nobody. I-I was totally alone in the world and the funny thing is, or the
strange thing is that I was totally unaware of it at that time. It occurred only years after the end of
the war, when I sort of went through my memory, it occurred to me that's what actually was the
case. And -- and she was the only one who was close to me and who -- who, as I said, who
sustained me. Then I-I had talked about the primitive nature of the house we lived in, that --
house is probably a -- a euphemism, maybe a cottage or a hut. I had mentioned the pump in the
garden, what I didn't say is, people might assume it was an electric pump, it wasn't, it was a
hand pump and you had to work very hard to get water up, pumping it and as I also mentioned,
in -- in winter sometimes it froze. The hut itself was built of wooden boards with -- with fairly
wide slits of what I would say an eighth of an inch or so and that made it, obviously, very
uncomfortable in winter. Through our Nazi friend, whom I had also mentioned before, we had --
we made contact to people where one could get building material. Building material of course,
were severely rationed and practically impossible to get and we got sort of insulation plates and
eve-even nails were hard to get and so we co-completely insulated the house from the inside with
sort of, some plastic type material. I don't know what it is any more. And -- and we got all that
material really, through his connections. Then one day during our stay there, suddenly the local
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 117
village policeman came and fortunately while I was out of the house. I was probably in Berlin
and he said he wanted to find out who was living there and asked Margaret's father all kinds of
questions, where he worked and he wanted to see the ID, which he showed him and -- and where
everybody else worked and whatever other questions. And then -- and he was fairly -- he wasn't
outright unfriendly, but -- but very business-like, which is in -- in -- in a rural setting in that
village is really unusual. People were sort of more like a family there. And at the end he said,
“Well, I hear there's a young man living here also.” And then Mr. Haas said, “Yes, that's my
nephew and his name so and so, Gunther Hessem,” that was my assumed false name. And the
policeman then said, “Well, I want to ask him some questions. When --” Yeah, and he was also
told that I'm working in a factory and then he asked when I am home and he was told I'll be back
on -- on the weekend and he said then, “Well, tell him I'll be here next Saturday,” I forgot,
probably 10 or whatever in the morning, “and I want to ask him some questions.” And -- and
then he left and -- and we felt very threatened by that and -- and of course I was the most
vulnerable because I was of military age and I did not have, as I explained earlier, the complete
set of required papers, so Margaret's father went immediately to our Nazi district leader friend
and complained bitterly about it, said that the village policeman, I remember his name, even. His
name was Mueller, good German name, had come and -- and interrogated him, almost like a
criminal and he felt very indignant. After all, he is an honest, honorable citizen and so on. And
Harry, the -- the Nazi's name, said, “Oh, don't worry about it Herman, he is a good friend of
mine, I'll take care of it.” And a few days later, Harry came, paid us a visit and said, “Mueller
isn't going to come any more here. I had a beer with him yesterday at the village pub and I told
him that you guys are good friends of mine and I've known you for years and you're honest,
honorable people and there was no reason to.” And we never saw Mueller again. So, unwittingly,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 118
the guy po-possibly might have saved our lives. I had once a close brush with arrest in Berlin. As
I mentioned, also earlier, the trips to Berlin were necessary to keep up with our black market
contacts and -- and to get food. And I should say also, by the way, that most of the food was
obtained by Margaret's father and his wife, they had of course many more contacts. They had
lived longer, they knew more people and -- but I had a number of people also, that I visited
usually once a week, sometimes twice a week. So, and I was always extremely careful. I think I
mentioned some of the strategies already that I used to avoid detection. And when I was riding in
the subway, I always rode -- sat on -- on the bench, sort of midway between the doors, which are
-- were on either end. So -- and -- and watching the people who would enter and if somebody
would enter whom I suspected or even knew, on the door to the right, I would get up and leave to
the left. Not that it ever came, but at least that was my strategy. Well, on -- on that particular day,
it was rush hour and I entered the train at the Wittenburg Platz station, in Witten, in the part of --
the busiest part of the western Berlin business district and since it was rush hour, the train was
packed with people, of course and I never got to the center, I just was sort of next to the entrance
door where I entered, sort of squeezed in between people. And as I stood there, as the train
rumbled and rumbled along -- and incidentally, after Wittenburg Platz, the train emerged from a
tunnel and became then an elevator train. I saw a chubby, short man next to me, say thank you to
a soldier who was also standing next to him, handing back his ID, and I immediately knew that
was a -- some sort of a secret policeman. And by that time it was obviously first of all, I couldn't
get out of the train and if I would have made one move, that would have even arranged --
aroused suspicion. So I just looked into the air, trying to look as harmless and innocent as I
could, but the guy sort of swung around and fixated me with his eyes and said, “Your papers,
please.” And he made me very ma -- nervous. I had been controlled, I must say, several times
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 119
before and usually it went very -- people looked at my ID and I greeted them with a snappy Heil
Hitler and that -- that's the job. Well, he looked at my ID and I -- the more he looked, the more I
noticed he must have been a real professional. He -- he looked back between me and the picture,
and it was of course my picture. Then he tried to lift the picture up to see how it was fastened to
the material of the ID and asked me one or two questions and I got so unbelievably nervous that I
noticed that my artery in my neck started really to pump very hard and that was something that I
couldn't control, but he must have noticed that. And -- and because he -- he constantly gave me
sharp looks and then I was already expected to be arrested or at least taken along for further
interrogation. Instead he handed me the paper back and said, “Thank you.” And I had the distinct
feeling that guy wasn't satisfied and the reason why he didn't arrest me is he had decided it might
be smarter to follow me, because I might lead him somewhere, where he could get maybe a
bigger catch, or something. So -- a-and at the next stop, which then, as I said was an elevated
stop, Nolendorf Platz, he left the tra -- he left the car. And I decided immediately, that guy didn't
leave. There are two possibilities. Either he had another man with him, whom I didn't know who
it was, whom he might give him -- have given some wink to follow me, or he would just have
gone to the next car and wait where I would leave. So I quickly, in my mind, made a plan of how
to shake off either him, or somebody whom I may not even know. And the next stop was
Buellerstrasser, was one of the busiest intersections in -- in Berlin. Buellerstrasser, corner
Putstamastrasser. And I-I left the car then and walked down and the stairs from the elevated
ended in a median strip between the two lanes of traffic, you know, going one way and one side
and the opposite way in the other side. And at the bottom of the stairs, I-I knew the area like my
own pockets. At the bottom of the stairs was a newspaper kiosk. So my plan was, and that's what
I did, I stopped at the newspaper kiosk and pretended t-to read newspapers and headlines and so
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 120
on, while out of my -- the corner of my right eye, I peered up, who was coming down the stairs
and I figured that if so -- if somebody whom I didn't know was going to follow me, that person
would sort of linger around and I could sort of make out who it was. Was the guy himself, of
course I would know and lo and behold, I had hardly stopped and started looking at the
newspaper, when I saw that guy come down. So he obviously did what I had suspected. He was
in another car and waited for me to leave. So I ignored him and just kept reading the newspapers
and that was probably not part of his plan. Because he had to follow me surreptitiously and if he
had lingered around there, I would have been aware of it. So he didn't He stayed, I don't know,
maybe 10, 20 seconds or so and then he crossed over to one side and that was exactly what I had
anticipated. I should say also, there was a traffic light at that corner of Buellerstrasser and
Putstamastrasser. So, once he crossed over to one side, I waited for the light to be such that
traffic was going and then I made my way, sprinted between cars, to the opposite side, so that
there were now two lanes of moving traffic between him and me. And then I walked along, not
to -- to the busy street, which was Putstamastrasser, but to the next block, which was a -- sort of
a residential street, with very few people only walking there. And -- but I-I -- in order not to
arouse suspicion, I didn't run, I just walked briskly, the way one walks purposefully in a city, if
one goes after some appointment or so. And as soon as I had turned the corner, I raced as fast as
I could and it was about 100 meter dash to the next corner and there I looked around and I saw
that guy come around also, following me. Then I-I walked, I-I turned again the corner and came
back at a different block of Putstamastrasser, see that busy street, jumped on a moving trolley
car. In those days, trolley cars had rear platforms, without a door, so you could, just by grabbing
the handlebars and jumping on, you could even jump o-on a -- a car, while it was -- they -- they -
- they didn't go very fast. While it was in the middle of -- of riding, driving. And -- in this way I
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 121
shook that guy off. I am still convinced that -- that he had some suspicion, that he was not -- my
paper was not that perfect. I should also say that, over the -- by that time, though, we are into
1944 and many of my friends and acquaintances, who had gone underground, or had -- one after
another had been caught by the Gestapo. I mentioned that cousin of mine, who had gone to
Bavaria and -- and his girlfriend. There were various schoolmates from my high school class
who got caught. Then that other friend, Galcoun, who wasn't caught, but who was murdered.
And -- and of course that -- that had an effect on -- on our, you know, mental outlook obviously
and -- but I guess there's a -- there's a German saying which sounds very cruel, but it was really
the case in our case, it's veba graba forwards, it means, “You walk forward over graves.” And
that's -- that was all the time what happened to us. We -- we lost a tremendous number of friends.
Some of them came back, but most did not. During that period of time, of course, also the
military situation changed more and more against Germany and that gave us a tremendous
morale boost. I mean, by that time, in the 1943, Italy had already capitulated and -- and then in
early '44, there were continuous rumors of a landing of the Allied Forces, somewhere in France.
And that happened finally, on June 6, 1944. I still remember the -- the day distinctly. Of course
we didn't have any radio in our hut, so we didn't know anything, but Margaret's parents were in
the city, in Berlin on that day, on -- on their various errands to contact black market sources. And
they had bought extra editions of newspapers, so when they arrived out, in -- in -- in -- in our
house, in our cottage in -- in the evening, they came with the news that the Allied had landed in
the Normandy and for Margaret, that was such a shock of joy that she broke out into tears. I-I-I
never forget that. And -- and we were just unbelievably happy. Of course, a-as the Allies then
continued to make progress, and yeah, I should say also, incidentally, on the eastern front, the
successes were tremendous. Even before that, in -- in 1943, I think the biggest attack battle of all
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 122
time took place in the area of Koosk and Orwell, in the western Soviet Union and where
Germany suffered a decisive defeat. And by that time, by 1944, when the allies landed in the --
the western allies landed in the Normandy, the Russians had already taken Warsaw and from
both sides, the allies were approaching finally, German territory. And, so one response of the
Nazi's was to create a new unit called folkshdum, best translated as “militia.” And all Germans
who were not -- all German males, I should say, between 16 and 60, who were not in the armed
forces, were immediately conscripted into that folkshdum. And the conscription, since they didn't
want to create a new bureaucracy, was -- the task of conscription was given to the Nazi party
organization, which was already an existing organization with offices and so on. And -- but now
it became necessary to have ideas, because if you're not in the Vairmarkt, in the armed forces or
any of its branches, you had to be in the folkshdum. It's was either one or the other. So
fortunately, Margaret's father had a -- a colleague from earlier days, also a Jewish colleague, I
mean, from the garment line, who was underground and he had access to blank ID's f-for the
folkshdum. And -- but what he couldn't supply was the -- the -- the rubber stamp, it -- it was
stamped by the Nazi party district, in which one was mustered in-into the folkshdum. And then I
remembered that I knew a stamp maker. So I went to -- and -- and he knew me only, also under
my forged, I mean assumed name, not who I really was. And of course for stamp makers it was
strictly forbidden to make official stamps because they can be used then for all kinds of purposes
-- illegal purposes. So I went to him and told him a long story, the story basically was that my
uncle was working in a local party district, registering folkshdum members and that in the -- in
the crush and the busy work there, somehow the stamp got lost. He thinks it may have fallen off
the table into a wastebasket and then empty out, but -- but he simply didn't know what happened
to it and he reported it immediately to the local -- to his boss, the district leader and the district
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 123
leader was very unhappy about that and said if that got into the wrong hands, you know,
anything can be done with forgeries and he holds him personally responsible, he better look
within two days, if he doesn't -- if he has not found the stamp, then he has to face consequences.
So -- a-and of course the consequences in those days usually were that the party would fire him
and then he would be immediately subject to military induction and be shipped to the eastern
front. And so I told that stamp maker, then finally said I would like to have that stamp within a
day. I -- I can give him, first of all, the actual cost, whatever it is. In addition to that, 300
cigarettes, 100 immediately and 200 when I get the stamp. And in those days, cigarettes were --
were almost worth their weight in gold. And so the guy agreed. I had the stamp within -- less
than two -- two days. And then Margaret's father went back to his friend and they made a deal
that he would give us, free of charge, two of folkshdum membership blanks and we in turn
would stamp his own with the party stamp that we had, also free of charge for itwasa. And so --
so that's what happened and of course, women didn't need a -- an ID as I said, because only
males were inducted into the folkshdum militia. So -- so we had, in fact I still have my
folkshdum ID. And -- and to have that ID was actually terrific because that obviated the need for
any military papers, because only people who were not in the armed forces were inducted into
the folkshdum. And since -- and the party, of course, had all of that background material. So, by
being in the folkshdum, that automatically implied that the military status of that person was
okay, whatever it was. And -- and also, of course, as the situation became more desperate for the
Nazis, there were more and more ID checks on the streets, I mean they were looking first of all
for German deserters. They were looking for allied spies, they were looking for -- you know they
had millions of foreign workers in Germany also, they had been forcibly deported to work in the
armaments industry. And many of those were on the loose, they just ran away. So, anyway, the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 124
thing was that having that paper, I'm sure saved my life, because I was then frequently
controlled, particularly by military police. Now, on the other hand, as the situation worsened, it
also became more and more difficult to get food. I-I-I should say where -- what with black
market food prices, I believe I mistakenly said in an earlier interview here, that the black market
prices were 10 times regular prices. That -- I have to take that back, it-it's closer to 100 times. In
other words, any, say pound of meat or whatever, was -- which whose price may have been one
mark regularly bought in a store with food ration stamps, would be 100 mark on the black
market. But, because of increasing shortages, because Germany of course, used to get a lot of its
food from the occupied areas and they were no longer occupying them, obviously the scarcity
grew higher and as the supply dwindled and the demand either stayed the same or increased,
obviously the price increased. So, just at that point, that problem was solved for us. What
happened was -- was that on a d -- on one day, I was also in Berlin, using the -- the subway and
as I sat there, a girl -- 1 mean young woman actually, a year or two older than I, whom I had
known from before, in fact she was a counselor in a vacation camp that I went to in the 1930's, in
the mid '30's and then later I met her again at Zeemans, where she was also a forced laborer. And
she approached me and said, “Oh hi, how are you,” and that, “I'm so happy to see you.” But
since one didn't trust anyone whom one hadn't seen continuously, I said, “Well, my name isn't
Fontheim.” And -- and then she said, “Well, don't you have a smaller sister?” I said, “No,” and I
gave her some fictitious name, say like my name is Irige Billow and I only have an older brother.
And she sort of left the train puzzled. And -- and at that point I decided she is obviously not
working for the Gestapo because she wouldn't be put off by such a rude, crude lie. Okay, but
anyway, about a week or two later, I ran into her again on the same sort of line of the subway
where I met her the first time and then I admitted that -- that her memory was really correct and
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 125
then she said, “Oh, that's marvelous,” and “let's sit down at a cafe and -- and then have a little
talk.” And I said, “That's a great idea, but I don't have any food ration coupons” And in
restaurants and cafes, you also had to pay, obviously, the price in mark, but in addition, which
was much more important, give the food coupons, equivalent for whatever you were ordering,
what -- even if it was just a piece of cake. And she said, “Och, d-d-don't bother, I invite you.” So
okay, so since I was always hungry, I fo -- I accepted the invitation, so we sat down in a cafe and
talked. Of course I have to say that I didn't tell her a thing, where I was actually living, we were
just talking sort of in general terms and -- and then she said -- yeah, I mean I-I asked her whether
I couldn't pay for the stamps, coupons that she used on me, she said no, she didn't pay for hers
either and in fact she'll show me how to get them free of charge and all one had to do is find out
where the last air raid -- there were daily air raids now. Where the last air raid was centered at.
And that was easy, that spread through Berlin like fire, the news, you know, last night this
district was hit or that district. So we went to where last night --
Q: Finish your sentence.
A: Oh, where last night the -- the allies had bombed, and looked up a house that was destroyed.
End of Tape Six, Side A

Beginning Tape Six, Side B
Q: This is tape one, side B of a continued interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997.
A: So we arrived at the part of town where last night's air raid had done the most of the damage
and then my friend -- her name by the way is Ursula, she said, ““What we need to do is first of all,
write down the address of a house that's completely destroyed, or at least remember and note it
down.” So, that's what we did. And then the German, sort of air raid support system was, by
years of experience, of course very well organized. Each house had -- I mean the -- the -- the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 126
people who lived in -- in each house knew exactly where to go if that house became destroyed. It
was usually a public -- usually a school nearby, sometimes a church or some such public
building. So -- and that was posted also in the -- near the building. So we -- after noting the
address of the place, of the house that was destroyed -- of course that was just one of many
houses, and also discovering where to go for further support, we went there and of course that
was a school, I remember and it was in the main auditorium and the place was mobbed with
people who had been bombed out the previous night. Some with some of their belongings still
saved and others with nothing. And there were -- and the place was run again by a subsidiary of
the Nazi party organization. And -- and then I-I stuck with her and we -- first of all registered at a
desk where a man in full Nazi party regalia was sitting. And she would give some fictitious name
and that address and saying that she lost all of her belongings, including even her papers. And so
they immediately did two things. They gave a person a temporary ID, identifying that person as a
bombed out person and also asking then all agencies of the government to sort of give any
support possible. And for people who had lost their food ration cards, they -- oh no, wait a
minute. I-I'm sorry, I take that back. They did not hand out any food ration. They simply noted
down the -- listed the person as totally bombed out and then they supplied people with
sandwiches and cigarettes and if they needed, also an overnight, a simple cot, although people
were urged, if possible, to move in with friends or relatives, but those who didn't have either,
could also stay overnight there. So, of course I followed her example, gave a differ -- I did not
give my name that I had adopted on my papers, I didn't want that to appear there. So I chose just
some arbitrary name that came to my mind, but the same address and I also got an ID,
identifying me as bombed out. Now the point was, with that ID, one could go then to any food
rationing office and get a set of food ration cards. And the idea of course was, you couldn't do it
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 127
in the same district where the building was located because they had, of course, a complete card
catalog of people who were living in that district and -- and of course neither one of these people
even existed. But with the bombed out ID, one -- any other food ration office -- suppose one
moved to a different part of Berlin than was required to hand out a -- a set of food ration cards.
And of course, in another district, they wouldn't have the set of -- of you know, registered people
living in that district. Comes to my mind, I'm glad that the tech -- to -- that today's technology
didn't exist in those days, because today all they would have to do is, on a computer, access a
database and look up anyone from any other di-district. But fortunately the Nazis didn't have that
capability yet, otherwise they would have used it. So what we did is we took them -- the subway
to a different part of Berlin. Went there, got our set of food ration cards and then took off. And
that was now the first set and I enjoyed that game so much, I-I should add also, by the way, that
the sandwiches they handed out were terrific. I had not had such good sa-salami sandwiches in --
in years, in fact. And that alone was even worth it. So I start practically every time when I was in
Berlin, since there were daily air raids, there was -- there were every -- every day there were
houses destroyed the preceding night, so all one had to do was sort of ask and find out in what
part of the city, to go there, look up an address of a destroyed, I mean house from the -- from last
night and then go to the local sort of air raid support facility, where people were helped with
their fi-first needs and so on, get another ID. And -- and so I kept doing that and finally at the
height of the thing, I got -- I-- I got food ration stamps for 16 people, without paying a penny for
it. So we could just go into stores and -- and buy food at the regular price-controlled prices,
which was peanuts. And -- and that obviously was a tremendous help also in our -- our, you
know, for our budget.

Q: Wasn't there any chance that there was going to be duplication?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 128
A: Yeah, I mean -- I-I am sure that these card officers, foo-food coupon officers where I went
under an assumed name then would forward my name and -- and this address that I gave to the
food office in that district and then within days they would find out that person never existed
there, and -- but by that time I was gone and when you -- the food ration coupons themselves
didn't have a name of a person on it. So you could -- you didn't have to be afraid that they knew
already that this was, the whole thing was a fake. I mean, I-I could use the stamps without being
afraid to be identified. It was a marvelous thing. And yeah, also of course, the continuous air
raids -- by the way, the air raids started I should say, really to become severe and shortly after we
moved there, I think I discussed that even, that helped us in -- in -- in our fictitious story that we
told people. And of course it got worse as the war went on and usually it was the British bomber
fleet coming at night and the Americans during daytime. And it was sometimes an awful --
awesome, not awful -- an awesome sight during daytime. The Americans were flying in like ona
sort of military exercise, in -- in close formation. And the roar of the bombers -- there were
hundreds usually, filled the heavens. It was for us almost a shout of liberation. And -- and they
were just coming an-and you -- we could see the anti-aircraft guns, the German flock firing at
them without much effect. And -- and then when they start dropping their bombs, the bombs sort
of had made a whistle sound as they fell down on the -- with tremendous speed. And -- and the
whistle sound then was followed by seconds of silence and then a tremendous explosion. And of
-- of course there were hundreds of them. It -- it -- it was a -- an unbelievable experience and --
and at night of course one couldn't see the bombers any more, but the noise was the same and --
and then of course the flames that engulfed large parts of the city would almost be a -- a --
present a ghostly scene of -- of fire and destruction. And obviously that had also a tremendous
effect on the population and people reacted differently, but by that time, it was obvious I think to
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 129
most sane people at least, that the war was lost. And if the war was lost, then all that destruction
and all of the German soldiers who were still falling on all fronts, were just a total waste or a
wasted loss, which wouldn't really do anything for Germany. And so many -- there was a lot of
dissatisfaction ex-expressed with the government. But it was all sort of below the surface and the
reason was, there was a tremendous government terror that increased. There wasn't just the
Gestapo, but I mean, the employed agents of the Gestapo, but there was a much larger army of
either paid or unpaid informers, or people who are sometimes just out of spite, were informing
on others. And obviously that kept people in line and they would often grumble only between
their four walls or to -- only to people whom they definitely knew to be okay and safe. But there
was increasing dissatisfaction as the war came closer to the German borders and the -- the
German government -- and particularly the propaganda machine of Goebbels, had another
weapon given to them and -- and that was actually by the Russians. The -- while it is
understandable that the Russians, who had suffered unbelievably under German occupation were
not very kindly disposed towards the Germans, but the -- the atrocities committed by the
Russians and the -- the totally wanton destruction in the wake of the Soviet army, was such that
Goebbels was able to whip up enthusiasm for continuing the fight by basically threatening the
Germans with the Russians. And of course the worst part of the terror probably were the
unbelievable rapes. I-I must admit that I did not believe the stories at first and thought they were
just an outgrowth of Goebbels propaganda, I mean in the same way how the antisemitic press,
for years had smeared the Jews with all kinds of sexual innuendoes and so on, which were just
inventions. But it turns out, I mean the Russians -- incidentally, the Russians did not only do that
in Germany, I mean, even in areas that they liberated, countries that were supposed to be allies,
like Czechoslovakia, Poland, there were unbelievable rapes in those countries. And so it can't be
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 130
just explained by the fact that there was an accumulated hatred against the Germans. But of
course that contributed to it. But, be that as it may, they handed the Germans a tremendous
propaganda weapon and -- and occasionally it would happen that the -- the German army would
make a counter-offensive and sort of re-occupy some locality which the Russians had already
taken before. And then they would immediately send in the entire press corps and -- and
interview people and they would get some sort of first hand horror stories of how the Russians
behaved. And I'm sure that was part of why th-the Germans put up resistance t-to the very end
But the -- the -- the fact is that resistance didn't give them any better results anyway and I would
say that any building that was destroyed and any German that was killed fighting in the latter
part of '44 and '45 was just a waste. Of course not to forget that during that time also, hundreds
of thousands, if not millions of Russians, still were killed and -- and also Jews were killed in the
Holocaust, which continued unabated. I should say on that subject, incidentally, the fact that a
holocaust was going on was totally unknown to us. We did occasionally -- we had opportunity to
listen to foreign broadcasts and incidentally, that was strictly forbidden and it was under death
penalty that if anyone listened to a foreign radio broadcast. But sometimes we had the chance to
and -- and -- and there were reports finally, mainly from BBC, the British radio, that the Nazis
were killing, at that time it was said, hundreds of thousands of Jews, and that -- while it filled us
with fear, it -- the number, hundreds of thousands, was so huge that it staggered our imagination.
And that was not even 10 percent of the truth, but we didn't know it in -- at that time.

Q: Had you heard of some of these notorious extermination centers?

A: Well, we definitely had heard of Auschwitz and -- because that was the -- that was the camp
that most Jews from Berlin were deported to. And -- at least in the later stages. In the beginning
there were also deportations to Riga and then other ghettos. But starting, I think about in the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 131
middle of 1942, maybe early fall of 1942, all deportations went to Auschwitz. Even that was not
really officially announced, but it somehow became known. So Auschwitz became known as a
destination for the deportations, but the term extermination camp was not known. I mean, what
was believed in general, that Jews were worked extremely hard under inhuman conditions and of
course people die under such conditions also. But that they were sort of murdered in a mass
production style, the way it was actually done, was not known to us. It may have now -- that -- I
have to add that German soldiers, hundreds of sol -- if not millions of them were in one way or
another witnesses of all of these exterminations. And -- and of course they, in -- in most cases
were too fearful to even report or -- or tell the -- or even told to keep that silent. But we were, I
mean in -- in a certain amount of isolation there and -- and to some extent I have to say that it
may also have been simply that we, or at least I myself, I can really only talk of mys -- about
myself, simply refused to believe that, that it was so horrible and -- and all the people who were
close to me were involved in -- in these deportations. And -- and maybe to some extent I -- it was
wishful thinking, that I did not believe in what really happened in those camps. But all I can say
is that I hoped, til the victory and even after that, to see my family again.

Q: Was there -- was there -- I mean you said people were fearful to even talk about them, so was
there much conversation at all about these places?

A: No, I mean, even in earlier times, it was -- somewhere I-I mentioned for example that after
the costan of Jewish males were arrested. They were all told that unless they wanted to come
back there, to keep their mouth shut. And so people only whispered about it. Some didn't talk at
all about it and some only to the closest friends or family members, what -- what really happened
and these were not extermination camps, they were just sort of quote everyday brutalities
committed by the SS.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 132
Q: What I'm try -- what I'm trying to get a sense of is -- since you were amongst German people,
not Jews at this point --

A: Right.

Q: And for quite a long time, did there seem to be any horror expressed or any remorse of what
was going on, other than the fact that the war had inconvenienced them terribly?

A: No, it was terrib -- the -- the horror was only at the impending loss of the war and what might
become of Germany and of them personally. I-I didn't -- of course, as I said, people had to be
careful, but -- but the people that we associated with, and we had a certain social life there and --
and as I had or said earlier, they -- the -- the cruelties against the Jews never even came up. Now
that's -- actually there's one exception. There was one family, an -- an elderly couple with a son
who is -- was about six, seven years older than I and was an officer in the Vairmarkt. They were
politically 100 percent -- they often even talked to us and that surprised us because you know,
they -- they should have been somewhat mistrustful, but they ex -- op-openly expressed their
opposition and their hatred of the Nazis and Hitler. They were -- one thing they were a very
devout Catholic family. And in northern Germany, where Berlin is located, the vast majority of
people of course, are Protestant. But I don't know whether that was the -- bu-but they were --
these people actually then, played a role in -- in our final survival. And that's a story I'm coming
to now. In -- in March -- in March 1945, about six weeks before the end of the war, we heard
through one of our friends that we sort of were socializing with, a very strange story. He -- he
met Mr. Haas, Margaret's father, and said he has to tell him something very funny. A -- a
pensioner, who lived in our area, and who earned himself some additional money by working on
people's property and he worked also often on a property of our neighbor and he was known as a
fanatical Nazi. And that pensioner had told him to be careful with us and stay away from us
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 133
because there's something not okay. We -- he is convinced that we are either foreign spies or
Jews. And -- and then when that man said, you know, “W-W-What makes you think so?” The
man said, “Well, they have -- they have a -- a Berlin address, where Herman Hesser lives.” And
there is actually a Herman Hesser living, he checked the phone book. But he decided to really
look into it himself. And so, he -- and being a pensioner, you know he had nothing better to do,
he took the subway and went to that address and actually rang the bell and there's indeed a
Herman Hesser living at that place, but it's a completely different person. And we simply used
that person's name to legitimize ourselves. And he told that fellow to -- to be careful and not to
say anything to us of stay -- and that guy again -- he was also, by the way, secretly very much
against the Nazis and made commensur. And he interpreted it as saying that now that the war is
obviously lost, that fanatical Nazi is sort of becoming -- going out of his mind, losing his mind.
And didn't take it seriously, in fact found it really funny. And well, Margaret's father came back
to us, he didn't find it funny at all, nor did we. And we were thinking about what to do now. Now
we knew that that guy probably would, within a day or two, notify the police, if he hadn't already
done so. And that we had to get out of there. And in fact we -- we had to get out sort of
seemingly just as if we go into the city. In other words, without luggage, in order not to arouse
suspicion. But we had all of our per-personal belongings there and many of them were also
necessary for survival. I mean we, in those days it was practically impossible to buy anything,
cloth -- gloves, clothing, anything you need. Shoes and so on. So we -- and of course also we
didn't really know where to go. So our first reaction was to talk to that elderly couple that I just
mentioned, and their son -- he was a first lieutenant in the German army, was actually home
during that week, on furlough. I think he -- he had some sort of a sick leave, he had a slight
injury. And -- and we knew that all of them are totally okay, so the plan was that I -- but we
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 134
wanted to talk to the son alone first. So I went over and asked the son, we would like to have a
card game with him, he sometimes played cards. And -- and he said, “Yeah, gladly,” he'll be
over in a few minutes. So in a few minutes he came and we both decided, among the four of us,
that the two women would stay in -- in the back room and Margaret's father and I and he would
sort of play the game. So Margaret's father started out, I still feared -- to mix the -- the cards, to
distribute then -- the cards, to -- to play the game, when he suddenly put down the cards on the
table and said -- actually, we -- we invited him not to play cards but to discuss some serious
business with him. And then he told him right of the events -- that our name isn't actually
Hessem. We are Jews who live here in hiding and our name is so and so and we -- and then he
told him what happened with that pensioner and that we have to get out immediately or within a
day at least. And also possibly save some of our belongings. And the -- the officer was in full
uniform. His name, incidentally, his first name is Heinz. He listened in stony silence, then he got
up and said he'll discuss everything with his parents and will be back as soon as possible. After
some time that to us seemed like an eternity, it was probably not more than 15, 20 minutes, I
don't know -- they lived just one block over from us, he came back not alone, but with his
mother. His mother was a gray haired -- sort of gray haired, dignified lady, came with a huge
basket of food, which she plunked on the table with a thump and an angry face and said, “Listen,
you have known our politics for -- for years now. We have known each other closely enough, we
could have helped you all that time. How come you didn't have confidence in us to tell us that
before?” And the food basket contained things which were worth a fortune on the black market.
Sausage, eggs and all kinds of things. And their -- their behavior was just incredible. So -- so
then they, right th-they said okay, what -- what they would -- they would like to, first of all,
support us in -- in hiding some of our belongings. And after some discussion, we made the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 135
following decision. As I had mentioned earlier, every night the British Air Force, the Royal Air
Force bombarded Berlin, and of course all surrounding areas and had airplane alert, and so
people would be up and then after the all clear siren, people obviously would go immediately to
sleep, because they had to get up early in the morning to go to work. So the decision was to wait
about half an hour after the all clear, hoping by that time everybody will be sound asleep and in
the meantime have suitcases with certain necessities packed and Heinz said he would help us
carry them over to their place and they have a shed behind their house where they could lock
them up and they would be safe there. And -- and then Heinz said he had a room in -- in the
southern borough of Berlin, Templehoff. It became known later under -- during the air lift of '48,
'50, because there was also an airport that played an important role in the air lift. But anyway, in
Templehoff he had a room where he could, we c -- all four of us could at least temporarily stay,
but or -- some of us. And Margaret's mother knew -- had a -- a girlfriend, I mean a woman friend
who was also underground. Now she had succeeded in totally legalizing herself with police
registration and so on. And she said that the next day, she and Margaret would try to go there and
-- and -- and Ma-Margaret's father and I would go to the room that Heinz had. And then, before
leaving, Heinz turned around, pulled out his revol -- service revolver, gave it to Margaret's father
and said, “Here is my service revolver. If they should come tonight, just finish them off in self
defense. The war is over soon, anyway.” And -- and then they left. That was an incredible thing
that he did. And -- and then the next day -- I mean then, at night, right, everything worked out the
way it was planned. We carried the luggage over and I don't know whether we got any sleep
done or not, we probably didn't feel like it. The next morning we left, you know, as if going to
work, with no particular luggage on us. And -- and never came back and I just want to say that
after -- the few weeks after the Battle of Berlin, I came back to visit the place and neighbors told
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 136
us that the following day, the Gestapo came looking for us. So that -- that really saved our lives.
So I-I, yeah -- then in that room where we stayed, incidentally, Heinz knew that the
superintendent of the house, a janitor, was a secret Communist. I don -- I never knew how -- how
he actually knew that because that was itself subject to execution, but anyway he knew and --
and he said he will talk to him about us, because he would -- he -- in -- in -- in the city, apartment
house janitors were responsible to have every new person who appears, registered with the
police, I discussed that earlier. So -- but he said, if -- he -- he would not tell him that we are Jews,
that doesn't fly well with Communists, we -- he'll just tell him -- tell him that we are some
Socialist activists and have to hide out. And so that's what he did and we were intoruss -- in fact I
remember the janitor's name, Kuchinski, sort of a Polish name, huh? And -- but I mean, he was a
German. And -- but Kuchinski himself had access to black market pistols. And so I bought a
pistol from him and -- for my own self protection and I had never had a gun in my hand in my
life and I decided if I, you know, ever have to use it in an emergency, I don't even -- I-I barely
knew where to pull the trigger, but not how to aim and so on. So I bought additional ammunition,
and that was also expensive. Each bullet costs -- I forgot, substantial amount of money. And
from a piece of paper, I made myself a -- sort of a goal to aim at, with concentric circles and then
I-I traveled out into a forest near Berlin and nailed it to a tree, of course in a solitary place where
no people were around and then I sort of practiced shot. And I -- and you know, in those days
these more old fashioned guns, I think today -- they had a tremendous sort of a backlash. And all
I remember is I never even hit the outer circle, not to speak of the inner circle. But at least I knew
a little bit of how to handle the thing. And actually I never had to use it, but at least it gave me
also some self confidence just to carry it with me. In the meantime, as I said, Margaret's mother
and she herself were with that woman friend of Mrs. Haas. And -- and in the meantime they --
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 137
they knew some other people, through whom they finally found a place in Pottsdam. Now
Pottsdam is a suburb. It used to be the summer residence of Prussian kings. And there's
particularly one famous castle, the one of Frederick the Great, called Soswasee, which is French
of course, means without worries or no worries. And that summer -- he was actually a great
Francophile and basically even talked mainly French and had his castle and also his garden
surrounding the castle designed in imitation of Versailles, on a much smaller scale, of course.
And it also contained an orangery, just like the park in Versailles does. The orangery basically
served to keep plants in winter, which were -- which were not durable during winter. And also a
servant's quarters for the gardeners. And that orangery had been turned into a huge sort of camp
for people who were out, bom-bombed out and also for refugees. I-I forgot to say that, actually.
As the Soviet army moved westward and came into areas which were inhabited by Germans, the
Germans were systematically evicted from everywhere. And even that was, it started already
before, I am now talking about March and early April, '45. Even in -- in midwinter, the -- the
Germans were evicted and day and night you could hear, on the country road that passed by near
that cottage where we lived, horse drawn carriages with ref -- German refugees, hundred them.
And, although that obviously was tremendous personal misery for these people, it filled me with
a tremendous joy to see, finally, the hardships of the war hitting back at those who had caused all
the misery to us, but also to other peoples. And -- and so there were millions and millions of
German refugees, who were streaming westward, into the still unoccupied areas of Germany,
including Berlin. And so, that orangery, as I said, was a huge camp for such people and so people
whom the Haas's knew, who -- who were themselves out bombed and lived there, they were
introduced simply as a family that was bombed out, but they said also they knew of my
existence, that it is too unsafe to have me there, because why would a youn-young 20, 22 year
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 138
old or so man be living there? I mean he would be normally in the Vairmarkt, fighting. So I
stayed then, alone in that room of Heinz in -- in the city, in the district of Templehoff and they
were out there. Of course I had a bicycle and I commuted -- I forgot what, once or twice a week
out there. One reason also is I had all these food coupons that I collected and kept collecting and
so I also brought food out there. And -- and -- and as -- as the war slowly sort of wound down to
an end. Now, the Battle of Berlin, 1-it -- yeah ona, I-I-I-I should say one other thing before the
battle. Th-th-the Germans made --
Q: Why don't you finish that thought and then --
A: No, but th-that's a totally new subject.
Q: Okay, then why don't we stop here?
End of Tape Six, Side B

Beginning of Tape Seven, Side A
Q: This is tape two, side A of an interview with Emest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997. The
interviewer is Randy Goldman.
A: Yeah, as the war finally came home to Germany, we were delighted to see in the official
vairmarkten, armed forces report, that was issued at the end of each day, finally German place
names. Names like Argen, Kern and so on, instead of names like Zabororja, Minsk, Halokoff,
Kiev and so on. That al-already felt like a liberation and there were more and more German place
names now in the official army reports. And all -- while all that happened, the government
maintained the official line that the war will be won, that there will be a final victory. As the
fronts on all sides collapsed, of course preparations were made for the defense of Berlin. I have
to say, that of all the insanities, that may have been probably the biggest one. There was n-no
reason really, to defend Berlin and the Germans should have done what the French did in 1940,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 139
declared an open city and surrendered. But of course that was not to be. Instead, throughout
Berlin, tank traps were built, ditches were dug. And the folkshdum was called up, finally, for
participating in the defense of the city. And often they would even grab civilians from the street
and just incorporate them in some unit. The battle itself began in earnest on April the 16th, 1945.
I never forget that day, because even though the -- the Russian front was on the east side of the
Oda river, which runs north-south and about 50 to 60 miles east of Berlin, so it was pretty far
away, but the artillery barrage was such that the ground under Berlin, under the city, was
rumbling and slightly shaking. And of course, in battle reports, which I read long after the end of
the war, I can see the reason why. That was the biggest concentration of artillery ever. The
Russians spent about two months getting ready for that assault on the city and they had
assembled a density of artillery which was unheard of. And they raked the entire German front
for hours and hours. As I said, that -- at that time I was living in the Berlin borough of
Templehoff and through the Communist, I mean secretly Communist janitor of the house that I
lived in, I also got some information of how the folkshdum members were called up and in fact
he showed me such a call up order that a friend of his got. So I-I kept a copy of that and then
typed on a typewriter that I had available, my own call up order, every day. So that if I had to -- I
had an errand to a certain part of the city, I would write myself a call up order that I had to report
there for duty. The reason was that there were -- I mean groups of folkshdum people either
grabbing civilians from the street, or also sometimes they are confiscating their bicycle, yeah. I-I
did all of my -- or almost all of my commuting by bicycle. Public transport had all but ceased to
exist. There were still a few subway lines that were -- would run intermittently between a few
stops until they came to a place where there was an artillery or a bomb crater, shutting down the -
- the rest of the line. So that was surely not reliable transport. But the folkshdum did have the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 140
power to confiscate bicycle for service, so I always -- I wrote my marching order always in such
a way that it -- it would say I have to appear with my b-bicycle, which for purposes of my
service, is confi-confiscated by the folkshdum, the -- the militia. I kept visiting a number of
friends and there was a peculiar atmosphere then. By -- by that time the Russians were still far
away from Berlin, but nobody knew how the Russians would take the city, what would happen
afterwards. After all, the city was still totally dominated by the Nazis, not just the military, also
propaganda-wise. Goebbels's voice was everywhere, in -- in newspapers, on the radio. And it -- it
seemed as if a deep chasm sort of separated us -- our today, from what would happen tomorrow
after the Nazis are gone and nobody could really imagine how it would be like. From day to day
of course, the Russians worked their way closer to the city and in fact, the way they planned their
attack, instead of entering the city from the east, they passed -- their units passed by Berlin to the
north and south, and then closed the pincer west of Berlin and -- and then entered the city from
the west. After -- and then the joy of hearing German city names in the official army report was
placed by the -- replaced by the even greater joy of hearing su-subdivisions and districts of
Berlin mentioned in the -- in the army report. Like parts of Shallotenburg, which is a well known
borough of the city, had fallen into Russian hands. Or the suburban railroad station of Eichner
has been taken by the Russians. It simply seemed unbelievable that these names, these place
names, where I had been sometimes only days before, were already in Russian hands. In fact,
there was a curious situation developing. People could make telephone calls into parts of the city
which were already occupied by the Russians, which were behind the Russian lines. That was the
weirdest thing, really. And visiting people, one usually parted never knowing whether one would
see each other again and instead of the German Auf Weidersain, which means really, “See you
again.” One would greet each other, I mean say good-bye with a formaller Ubalips -- that means,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 141
“Survive it.” And as I said, nobody could even imagine how life would be once the Nazis were
gone. Berlin was, of course under constant bombardment and in the beginning, when the first
artillery shells fell on the city in the -- in -- in the inner parts of the city, Goebbels distributed a
news release saying that these are not enemy artillery bombardment, but trial runs of a new
German sort of miracle weapon, which is going to be used any day now, to throw the Russians
back again. And there were people who believed this nonsense. Yeah, let me -- so the -- the -- the
city and of course also electricity slowly stopped being supplied and water stopped being
supplied in Berlin, even it -- it had already been drained by evacuation of ma -- children and
infirm people. There were still, I think, between three and four million people in the city and to
imagine, that city was sort of headed into chaos, without -- without running water, without at
least reliable electricity and the gas lines on many places were -- had been, of course, hit. And so
there was no gas supply any more for cooking. The -- for me the crucial day was Sunday and I
remember distinctly, Sunday, April 22nd, 1945. On -- by orders of Goebbels, who, besides all his
other offices, was also in charge of the defense of Berlin, on his orders, all food st-stores were
ordered to be open. Now anyone who knows Germany and German mentality, must be aware
that the closing of stores on Sunday, of all stores, was something absolutely holy. There was
nothing -- there was always one day, one Sunday -- that was the Sunday before Christmas, where
stores were open, that was a tradition, but on all other Sundays, nothing -- the world had to go
under for -- for an order to be issued for stores to be open. And that of course, exactly was what
was happening. I mean their world was going under. And it was obvious then, that what
Goebbels wanted to avoid is that the food stores and the shops might be maybe taken by Russian
troops. And rather than have that happen, had to distribute it to the population. And in fact, there
was enough food there that he also announced the distribution of all kinds of special rations. See
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 142
how the -- the ration coupons had -- of course most coupons were dedicated, like it would say for
100 gram of butter or 100 gram of meat or whatever, this and that. But there were certain
coupons always which were unassigned. They were just labeled with a letter, like A, B, C or
something, for special occasions. And so, he -- he announced that on coupon A, everybody
would get so much of this food and on coupon B, so much of that food. There was a -- a -- a
tremendous amount of these special rations amounts. Now here I was with my 16 food ration
cards for 16 people. So I basically went wild. I went -- found -- of course that was in the days
before the supermarket, so in other words, you had to go to the butcher separately and to the
baker and to the dairy, for each particular type of food. And so I was busy for a long time, you
know, buying all that and coll -- and bringing it into the room which I occupied in -- in
Templehoff and thinking how I can get most of it out to Pottsdam, to my friends. And -- and then
-- but even more overpowering was, that on that day, finally, beaten German army units started
to stream into Berlin. And that is a sight which I will never forget, I think that made -- that day I
can say without equivo-vocation may be the happiest day in my life. Anyone who has seen
German soldiers in -- in an ordinary life or in -- du-during the war or on -- on parades, they
always looked spic and span, there was not a button missing, there was not a spot. An-and -- and
they all -- an-and they looked well-shaved, clean and -- and with a certain aggressive stride and
demeanor. These guys who came back, they were dirty, unshaved. Their uniforms had buttons
missing. Many had bloody bandages around their head or their arms in a sling. None of them
bore any weapons and -- and they had that dull look of defeat in their eyes. Wh-wh-when I saw
those guys, I finally -- even though I knew the war was lost for Germany of course, somehow
intellectually and mentally, but now I saw it with my own eyes and I almost lost my mind. I-I got
on my bike, I remember and bicycled along and felt almost like thanking each of these soldiers
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 143
for the way they looked. I-I'm somewhat of a history buff and I had read reports of Napoleon's
army streaming back from Russia after their defeat in 1812 and -- and these guys looked exactly
like those descriptions of Napoleon's defeated army. And -- and then the -- the eerie thing was
that now and then truckloads of newly outfitted soldiers, who looked clean and fresh and with
weapons, drove into the opposite direction, towards the -- towards the front, which was probably
just, I don't know, 10 or 20 miles or so away, if that much. So -- but then I -- I finally sort of
grabbed a hold of myself and -- and went back to the house and this German apartment houses
are always sort of built with a courtyard in the back and the rumor spread that -- there was one
person apparently, who for some reason owned a horse and he couldn't feed that horse anymore
and so he decided to have it slaughtered by a professional butcher. But of course there was no
refrigeration either, so he couldn't say, keep the -- the meat for-forever. So he invited just anyone
from the house to serve himself. So it was incredible, I-I got myself a long, sharp knife and went
downstairs and cut a sort of a big chunk out of the upper thigh, or the rear end of -- of the horse,
of the dead horse that was lying there. And a-as -- as -- as another sort of trophy. And -- and then
another rumor spread that was -- th- there -- there was a huge freight yards of the German
railroads, about -- less than a mile away from that apartment building and the rumor spread that
the Vairmarkt, the German army had just abandoned and withdrawn from the freight yards and
that there were many freight cars loaded with food. And then I got on my bike with a knapsack
and -- and bicycled to the -- to the freight yard and I saw already people streaming there from all
over and -- and then the -- the freight yard was periodically raked with machine gun fire from
deep diving Russian fighter planes. And you know, to avoid being shot, I-I sort of threw the
bicycle away and -- and I had to -- anyway I wasn't on my bike, it was across tracks, so I-I-I
walked, pushed it. And then I-I threw myself down, pressed myself against the -- sort of the --
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 144
wh-what are these, these wooden ties, I guess, the railroad ties and -- until the planes had gone
and then I would get up. So then I-I came to a -- to a railroad car, which had, was loaded with big
vats full of butter, so ea-each one, maybe 50 pounds or so. And -- so how do you -- an-and that
was sort of solid butter, so how do you grab solid butter? Well, I had a -- I had a huge
screwdriver in a tool kit on my bike, so I got that screwdriver out and sort of staked out a huge
sort of a cube of butter and took it with my hands and threw it in my, into my knapsack, which at
other times, I had taken potatoes in, with dirty peels and -- and -- and coal and so on. So what I
decided, if the outer layer of the butter is covered with dirt, I'll just cut off a layer and then inside
it should be clean. So, anyway -- so then I-I-I took that back and -- and my room that I had in
that house was like a veritable sort of food storage place. Incidentally, as a side light, when I
came back after the war, I-I was told that maybe half an hour or so after I left that place, the
folkshdum turned up there, collected all males, put them on trucks and drove them out to the
front. So I was spared having to fight the Russians. And -- and then I decided I-I better get al --
o-o-on the one hand I didn't want to get out of Berlin, because I felt a tremendous inner
excitement, to see the fall of a major capital, which had a sort of world dominating role played,
was to me like -- see, witnessing the fall of Rome to the Germanic tribes, whatever, 2000 years
or so earlier and that filled me with excitement. But on the other hand, I -- I really felt that I
wanted to spend these hours with Margaret and so I-I finally -- what I did is I wrote myself a
marching order for the folkshdum, which said that my battalion that I belonged to, had to report
for duty in Pottsdam, which I h-had earlier mentioned, the suburb where Margaret and her
parents had found a place. And I put as much into the knapsack as I could, I mean the more s --
vulnerable things of course, were the butter and also the -- the chunk of horsemeat. And -- and
then a few other things, I don -- I-I forgot what it was, anyway, was a knapsack just full with
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 145
food and -- and by that time also, the army had taken over traffic control and at each major
intersection, there were transportation officers directing traffic of course, what there was was the
traffic was all military by that time. Military trucks and -- and jeeps and this sort of thing. And
there was a major intersection near the house where I lived and I-I went up to the officer in
charge and told him that I had been ordered to report into Pottsdam and whether he knew
whether the highway to Pottsdam was still open or whether the Russians had cut it. By the way,
the Russians then were always referred to by their nickname, Ivan. So -- Ivan in English. So -- I -
- that's how you talked about them, with a Ivan, because no -- nobody really knew it and -- and
the officers answer was that he knows only what goes on within a radius as far as he can see in
each direction. And he -- he didn't under -- it was just total chaos. And -- and -- and those idiots
were still fighting and -- and defending the city. And by the way, at each of these intersections,
like that also, there were heavy guns and -- put into place, that -- so that in case Russian tanks
would appear, they would immediately be subject to heavy artillery fire. So anyway, I decided, I
mean to see whether I can get through to Pottsdam, there were rumors that the Russians had
already cut that highway. And I got on my bike and with my marching orders and everything and
-- and set out. And that trip to Pottsdam was a -- a -- a major experience. Th-the -- the -- the
highway was mobbed, Pottsdam was in the direction sort of southwest of Berlin. In other words,
sort of away from the eastern front and it was full with people. And -- and all kinds. There were
groups of allied soldiers, I mean British and French, who were obviously prisoners of war and
which you had seen throughout the war, always in groups, but under heavy German military
guard. These guys, they were simply walking down there, no-nobody even, they were part of the
population, nobody even gave a damn that they were supposed to be under German military
guard. I suppose they were trying to get home or something. There were foreign laborers. There
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 146
were people who pushed, sort of some belongings they wanted to save, in -- in baby carriages or
in little wagons that they pulled. And then -- now and then a -- a fancy, big Mercedes, with the
driver leaning on the horn to make way, was slowly making its way, getting some big shot out of
the city before the Russians would take it. And then, in the midst of all of that, periodically,
Russian fighter planes would st-swoop down and rake the street with machine gun fire and then
everybody, like on a -- a -- as even blown away by the wind, would vanish to the sides of the
road. And there are sort of rainwater ditches on each side, and lie down there until that danger
was over, then get back up and walk. It was the most incredible, it was a -- a -- the -- part of it I
bicycled, part I pushed. Yeah, there were some areas where there was a b -- one area, I think,
where a water main was broken and the -- the water was almost knee high. So you had to wade
through that and -- anyway -- and -- and then finally I arrived at the bridge which connected
Berlin to Pottsdam, the -- there was actually, at the western outskirts of Berlin is a -- there was a
havel, spelled exactly by the way, the same way as the name of the president of the Czech
Republic, H-a-v-e-l. That river also separates Berlin and Pottsdam, there's a bridge leading over
it and that's how you get then, from Berlin into Pottsdam. The name of the bridge is Gleenic
arburger and -- which became famous several decades later, which I couldn't have known at that
time, of course. It's famous because that's where, often, spies were exchanged. Yeah, that was, of
course, West Berlin, then. What -- what became later West Berlin and among others for example,
the Jewish refusnik Anatoly Sharunski, now an Israeli minister, Nathan Sharunski was
exchanged there and given freedom on that bridge. Well, anyway, at that bridge, I saw already, at
the distance, was completely, there was a -- like a chain across the bridge, of SS, checking
carefully everybody's papers. So -- but I had my folkshdum ID and my marching orders to report
to Pottsdam, so I figured nothing can happen. I-I had in my breast pocket also, the gun which I
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 147
had bought on the black market, through that janitor, but I was hoping not to have to use it. And
of course there was such a sea of humanity, they obviously didn't really have the time anyway to
do very thorough checks, but they found my papers to be in order and -- and then I-I passed
through and I had to still bicycle through a major part of Pottsdam, because the park of
Soswasee, where that orangery building was located, was on the other side of Pottsdam and --
and then I appeared there and they had already almost given up hope that I would be able to get
out of Berlin. So that was the 22nd. But I had still a lot of food left in the -- in the apartment, so I
decided the next day, I ought to go back and -- and pick up some more food. And when I arrived
at the Gleenic Arburger to bicycle across, the commanding officer told not just me, but
everybody else, that Russians were reported nearby -- oh yeah, and -- and of course all bridges
had been -- had been supplied with explosive charges, so that at the approach of Russian troops,
they would be blown up so that they couldn't use the bridges. That was another part of the
insanity, because while the Russians could have used the bridge, these bridges also were part of
the German infrastructure, which at that time was already almost totally destroyed and -- and
under those conditions, with a -- a lack of raw materials and so on, wasn't easily re-buildable in -
- in those days. But -- but the Germans and -- and particular the Nazi party fa -- we-were so
fanatic, that they completely disregarded the needs of their own population, even. But I mean,
they had it coming. The -- with all of that, I -- my thoughts always go back again to the period of
the deportations. And how brutally the Jews were treated and nobody gave a damn about them
either at that time. And -- and furthermore, I didn't even know yet, what had become of my
parents and everybody else who had been close to me or whom I had known and I was still
hoping to see them back once that whole thing was over. And I decided t-to go across the bridge
anyway, hoping that they wouldn't dynamite it soon.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 148
Q: It's okay, it's okay.

A: Oh. And -- but then I was finally stopped, as I said, when I came to Pottsdam the day before,
there was a place where a water main had broken and the water was almost knee high. Where by
th-the next day I came back, it was even higher and it was under a bridge. And I mean that, it
was practically impossible to -- you'd have to swim across and of course I would have been
completely wet then and -- anyway, I didn't have the stomach to do it, so -- and how would I
have taken the bike through it? So I just returned without having been able to get into the city
again. Th-There was constant artillery bombardment of course. The 22nd, by that time, was over.
That was the day when I went out. Now the day where I made the unsuccessful attempt to return,
was the 23rd. So that is over now, then there were several days -- there were several days of -- of
fighting and -- and finally on the twent -- yeah -- and final -- yeah -- wh-what we had to do also
is, we finally decided -- we meaning all of the people who lived there as refugees, to transfer to
the basement. There was a huge basement with s-sort of simple benches and actually no
electricity, only some candles we had occasionally. And we just sort of hoped to wait out the
worst danger. On the 27th of April, there was still no change, there was still artillery rumble and
-- but we didn't know what was going on. So I decided I ought to go out and look and see what
the situation is. I went out and didn't see a soul until I finally saw a man in what looked to me
like the uniform of the -- an engineering battal -- the German army had engineering battalions
which had sort of brownish type uniforms, which were used in support of the troops. I mean, to -
- to build more quickly, bridges over rivers and things like that. And so I-I shouted at the guy and
wanted to -- to know where -- wh-whether he knew where Ivan is. His response was to point his
gun at me and shout back at me in a language that I had never heard before. And run toward me
as I stood there with my raised arms and then he grabbed my left arm, saw the watch, gave it a
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 149
strong jerk, pulled the watch off and vanished again. So from that I knew that the Russians had
arrived, which I related downstairs. And from then on we frequently were visited by Russians
who came down there. They were interested only in two things. One was the women and the
other one was possessions of any value. They took everybody's watches of course and other
valuables and -- and many women were taken, not just once, but innumerable times. And -- and
so that went on for a day or two and -- and of course caused everyone to be totally demoralized
and -- and then I think on -- on the second day or so, I -- there -- there was an artillery unit
actually stationed in front of the orangery building, fighting was still going on in the
neighborhood. And that artillery unit was under the command of a colonel who made a more
educated impression than the run of the mill Russian soldiers. And in particular, he spoke fairly
fluent German. And -- so Margaret's father went up to him and introduced himself and told him
that -- that we are Jews, whether -- that's the first Russian word that I learned, Jew means Yvrai
in -- in Russian. And -- and we were treated just like the Germans, even though we had suffered
under them, just the same way the Russians. So the colonel pulled out a piece of paper and wrote
something down in Russian and said whenever in the future, Russians sort of try to attack us or
molest us, to show that paper. And okay -- and then he -- he got orders to move on, which he did.
And then -- now unbeknownst to me also, by the way, the -- the Russian commander in the area,
had ca-called on all German forces to surrender and furthermore had, i-in that order also, had
declared that any German who tries to eva -- any German soldier who tries to evade captivity by
putting on civilian clothes, will be treated by the Soviet armed forces exactly the same way as he
would have been treated by the German forces. And the German force -- the German forces, I
mean that was already going on for months. Any deserter was, after a brief re -- cursory so called
military tribunal, was immediately hung from a tree and with a sign around his neck, I am too
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 150
much of a coward to fight for my country and -- and for our women and children. And -- or
something of that nature. In other words, what it meant is that if a German civilian was found, he
could be immediately executed by the Russians, because they would interpreted that as the guy
being a deserter, trying to evade captivity. So I was out, on -- on that day and that was about, I
think a day after that colonel came, either the same day, later or the next day. And a-again, a
Russian soldier was in the neighborhood, whereas -- as soon as he saw me, he pointed his gun at
me and -- and pointed me toward a tree. As I said, it was in a park there. And I saw immediately
that he was going to execute me. So I shouted down into the basement for Margaret's father to
come up, because he had that paper that that Russian colonel had -- had given him, in Russian.
And he came running up and handed the paper to that Russian soldier. He looked at it and made
a motion with it, as if he was wiping his rear end with it, sort of put it in his fist and crumpled it
up and threw it away and told him to wait there too. Then I stood at the tree while he aimed at
me. And at that moment, the only thing I could think of is, I survived the Nazis and now I end up
like this. And I could hear the click of the trigger, but nothing came out and he did that two or
three times and then he got mad and sort of threw his gun on the floor and shouted to me at
Russian -- in -- in Russian, which I didn't understand and pointing at the tree, what it obviously
meant, that I should wait for him there at the tree, to be shot when he comes back with a different
gun. And of course then Margaret's father and I, we immediately ran -- there was some bushes
not too far away and hid sort of right at the bottom there. And it wasn't long, I don't know, maybe
five minutes, maybe less, I don't -- when he came back and -- and we heard him shout and I was
just sweating with fear. And we know that wouldn't be long until he found us and all we heard is
he kept shouting and then new voices appeared, more voices and -- which -- wa -- since we didn't
know Russian, I don't know what all these voices were saying, but apparently they had to move
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 151
on because the voices became more and more distant and -- and then finally ceased. And -- but
we decided that maybe the guy is just lying in wait for us, so we -- we waited there for at least an
hour, if not more. And -- co -- wa-was completely silent, until we were sure that he really had
left the area.
End of Tape Seven, Side A

Beginning of Tape Seven, Side B
Q: This is tape two, side B, of an interview with Ermest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997.
A: So we finally emerged from there and there was not a soul around. Then we went back into
the basement and there was a tremendous shout of relief. Apparently, downstairs, somebody
must have seen the Russian soldier pointing his gun at me, so the rumor had spread that both of
us had been shot. And -- so when we appeared alive, obviously the joy was great. So then, finally
came the first of May, 1945. And the first of May, of course, is a big Russian holiday, a Soviet
holiday and -- and it was for the soldiers. By that time, things had sort of quieted down a little
bit, although not too much and a large group of soldiers visited us. It somehow spread around
that Margaret's father, who was in general very handy, was also very good in some simple sort
of dressing up wounds and things like that. And we had, of course for our own purposes, all
kinds of medical supplies. And there were some soldiers who had, I don't know what it was any
more, some open flesh wounds flumow and anyway, he treated them. And then there was also a
piano around for some reason and he played the piano and to celebrate them, he played the s-
song, “The Internationale,” which is the sort of international Communist party song. And that
made them all very happy and -- and they became sort of somewhat friendly and then one -- I
remember one soldier, he was a -- a giant of a guy, pulling out of a -- a dirty pocket, some
equally dirty photographs of -- were obviously family pictures. Wife, children or something. And
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 152
with -- with tears streaming down his face, he said they were all killed by the Germans. And --
and then after awhile, they said they needed all of the women to co-come along. And then so
obviously we were very uneasy about that and then we said, you know, what they wanted -- I
mean there was very difficult communication, obviously. None of us spoke Russian and they
only knew sort of a s-smattering of some German words. Anyway, it turned out they had nearby,
sort of a -- some battalion or regiment camped and to prepare for their meal, they needed people
to peel potatoes. And so we immediately, all of u -- males, volunteered to go and so they took the
women and the men along to about, I don't know, it wasn't far away, a quarter of a mile or so,
where they were camped and put us down and they had piles and piles of potatoes. And so we --
we peeled potatoes for them. And in fact they had discovered apparently somewhere, a storage
shed that was full with potatoes. And one d -- and they needed more from there. One of the
Russian soldiers took Margaret's father along to help him carry them in a-- in a sack or
something. And when they opened the door of the shed, the first thing, before they even saw the
potatoes, there was a dead German woman lying. So the soldiers just -- soldier kicked her away
with his foot and said something like “Kaput,” which is a German word for broken. And then
they gathered the potatoes and -- and -- and brought them back. And -- and then we peeled
potatoes and then we were actually taken back by them. Oh, while we -- while we -- while we
peeled the potatoes, they had accordion players there, they -- they played the accordion and sang
songs, so for awhile it became even somewhat romantic and they also gave us some meat dishes
to eat, which was hearty and -- even if not exactly gourmet style, but we were always hungry in
those days and would have eaten anything. And -- and then we were taken back by them again,
to the -- to the orangery where we all stayed. But I mean, there were also, still, less pleasant
incidents and robberies and so on. So a day or two later, I decided that we need really, some
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 153
more firm protection, that by now, since the city, there was no more fighting, even nearby, there
must be a city commander. And so I-I-I got up -- out, and said that I will try to find where the
commander is and see whether we can get some protection. And of course I had no idea wh -- th-
the city picture was totally changed. You know, a few days before, the last time I walked in the
city, it was full with Nazi party uniforms, SS, Vairmarkt uniforms. All of that has vanished as if
swallowed up by the earth and all one saw was Russian uniforms. And the traffic was -- the
traffic police, they were all women, usually very hefty looking women. Their most prominent
feature, they were all unbelievably heavily bosomed and they carried two sort of colored sticks, I
remember. I think one red, one yellow, which they waved in some prescribed form, with the left
hand and with the right hand, indicating which direction could move and which had to halt. And
actually they did it in a very snappy, military fashion. I enjoyed actually looking on, just seeing
them perform these duties. Now, in the meantime, in order to f-find the -- where the commandant
-- the commandature was. Commandature is a Russian word actually, meaning the command
office for the -- for the city commander. And I was always pointed in some direction, so I just
kept going in the direction that I was pointed at, until I arrived in front of a huge villa and that
villa was beleaguered by a huge -- by, actually by two huge throngs. As I found out in a minute,
one were Germans and the other one were foreigners. Practically all of them false laborers who
had been deported to Germany and who obviously went there for help in trying to get back to
their home countries. There were Frenchmen, Belgians, Poles, e-e-everyone. And -- and the other
throng were Germans. The one person I remember was a German medical officer, who was in
charge of the local military hospital where -- I mean the Russians left him in charge -- these were
all soldiers with fairly heavy wounds. He came to complain that his nurses were being constantly
raped and therefore could not fulfill their duties to the patients. And I decided immediately not to
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 154
identify myself with the Germans, so I stood with the foreign laborers. Oh yeah, and I forgot to
mention also, we had -- when we left that village overnight, we had taken along also, all our real
identifications, so that -- because obviously we knew the war would end within days or weeks,
that we could then establish our true identities. And, among other things I also had saved my
Jewish star, which I then put on. And as I said -- and I -- I waited there together with all the
foreigners. And so it was of course a slow process. So finally it was my turn, I was ushered in
and was in some sort of a front room, entry room or waiting room, whatever and was told to wait
and then one, from -- behind it, apparently, was a real office and then one officer came and took
a look at me with that star and sort of shouted something in Russian to the back and then an
officer with sort of more stars and so on, who seemed to be the commander, came out. He was
sort of a short, stocky, heavy-set guy. Took one look at me and -- and then asked me in fairly
good German, “You are a Jew?” And I said, “Yes.” And then he -- he ran toward me, embraced
me and -- and told, sorry -- told me that I was the first Jew whom he -- whom he saw in -- in
weeks or months. There was n-no Jew left anywhere... Okay, then he -- he asked me in his office
and sit down and told me that, to tell him how come that I wasn't killed. So I briefly told him
what had happened to me and -- and also that I was actually together with a family of friends and
that we needed some personal protection and then he -- he told me I should, as soon as possible,
bring the whole family, he wants to meet them. Oh, and -- and of course, I forgot, his name was
Major Shike and of course, he was a Jew himself... So yeah, the only thing then at there, before I
left, he asked me, he said he -- he wants to keep my yellow star as a souvenir. So I gladly gave
that to him. And then I went back and I forgot, either the same day or the next day, all four of us
went there and met Major Shike again and he award us a piece of paper in Russian. That one was
not thrown away by anyone, in fact I still have it among my souvenirs and in fact I never knew
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 155
what it really said and of course, with the Russian immigration to this country here during the
last decade or so, we also -- we made some Russian friends in Ann Arbor and I had that guy
translate it to me, for the first time -- what, 40 years after Major Shike gave it to me. And it -- it
simply said that every possible protection is give -- to be given to the Jackass -- fact he ordered
in one word, I guess he didn't realize that it was a first and a last name, family and -- and also
that we are supposed to be supplied generously with food. Oh, yeah, he told us also that the
Soviet army was soon going to start handing out food to the population and they will be very
small, restricted rations, you know, like so many crumbs of bread and this and that. And so there
will also be long lines. But with that piece of paper, first of all, we did not have to stand in line,
but we could right away go to the counter and also, we -- we should buy whatever we thought or
needed to buy. And regardless of what the official rations are. And you can imagine the pride we
-- after years of being always kicked to the back, now we could go to the front and the Germans
had to stay behind and wait. And so that went on for -- I mean then our -- our life go-got much
better and we were not molested any more. But the next thing was of course, we wanted to get
back to Berlin. And so I guess we had to find out whether there is a suburban railroad line going
from Pottsdam to Berlin. And so I suggested, I-I wrote to the railroad station, which was also
several miles -- that castle was somewhat out of town, of Pottsdam. And to check the railroad
station and where the trains are going. And when I got to the railroad station, it was an incredible
picture of destruction. Somebody should have painted or at least photographed it, but of course
in those days we didn't have a camera and I don't have a talent for a painter. But the -- the -- the
railroad, there was hardly any railroad car that was standing on its wheels, they were lying on
their sides, there were bomb craters all over and one locomotive apparently, must have been --
due to some force of some explosion, was standing on its heads wi -- on -- on the front end, with
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 156
the wheels o-on the side, a totally grotesque picture. And -- and wires were hanging and signal 1-
lights were dangling down or overturned. I mean you had to take one look and know not only
that nothing is running now, but that nothing would be running for weeks probably or months or
longer. So I walked back to give that report and on the way back, along one of the streets, I saw a
sizable group of Germans, coming under guard by -- by two Russians, one Russian in front with
a gun over the shoulder and one Russian behind. And they were wearing not the usual army
uniform. I mean it looked similar to the army uniform, except that their military hats were green.
And these were actually the NK VD troops, which -- they were the forerunner of what later
became KGB. And so I walked -- I mean I walked along and they came toward me and as they
were -- as they were passed me, the soldier in front asked me for my papers. And I-I had my
Jewish ID and naively I thought, you know, the guy knows immediately that -- you know, it
didn't say Jew, it just has a J printed on top of it. And furthermore, of course it was in the Roman
letters, which are used i-in German and not in Cyrillic, which the Russians use. Anyway, he
didn't even look at the -- at the ID, he took the ID, put it in his uniform pocket and -- and told me
-- I guess there were only a few words he knew in German, one of them was com. That means
come. And then I tried to tell him that Y-Yvrai and he just waved me off. So -- so then I
suddenly found myself a prisoner of the NK VD. And we walked for several blocks and I noticed,
it seemed totally random. There were some Germans whom we let pass by and then again one he
would take along. I-I couldn't figure out what, if any -- principle governed his a -- and by now,
having seen the Russians operate, I'm sure it was random, that there was no principle involved.
So anyway, we finally stopped at a large villa, which was -- had been confiscated by the
Russians. And on the side of the -- w-we walked over to the side. On the side of the villa, a table
was set -- oh I'm sorry -- a table was set up and behind that table, there was a -- an officer, also
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 157
with a green hat, n-next to a civilian. And -- and we were sort of lined up in -- in -- in front, on
the other side of the table at a certain distance. And then we were called up, one by one, to sit
down -- there was one chair across from them, to sit down and being asked questions. When it
came to my turn -- and by the way, the officer, the interrogating officer looked exactly like a
brutal SS man, except the uniform was different. When it came to my turn, he asked -- the
questions were asked by him in Russian, by the way and the civilian next to him was an
interpreter, then he gave it to me in German. And they were all very standard, harmless question.
My name, my address, my father's name, that sort of thing, date of birth. And after the last
question, then he turned that thing that he had filled out, that sheet of paper, over to me and --
and asked me to sign at the bottom. Now, not only was everything that he filled out and so on, in
Cyrillic, but then there was a long paragraph below the filled out part, of text. So I pushed that
thing over to the interpreter and asked him politely to inter -- I wanted to know what I'm signing,
you know. Interpret it to me. But instead of translating it in -- into German, he told the officer
that I wanted it translated. And then the officer barked something that didn't sound very
appealing to me and then the interpreter said, “He says,” you know, “my boss says, if you don't
sign it right away, he beat you to death right here on the spot.” So I signed it and was convinced
at that time and somewhat even today still, that I probably signed that I volunteer to go to
Siberia. And so then, an-and actually, a few of the people after that interrogation ended were sent
home. Others were not and of course I was in the latter group. Then we were, after we were
through with all of them, we were led around to the back and in the back yard there was an air
raid shelter ditch, which the Germans had dug during the war, to protect, I mean, against air
raids. And what it was is, it's a ditch, you know, about I would say, about three yards wide and
about five feet -- five feet deep at most, maybe a little bit less. And then over it was a sort of pre-
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 158
cast concrete sort of arch that extended the length of the ditch. So an-and that pre-cast concrete
arch then, would be covered, or was covered with earth and something planted on it, so that it
was camouflaged, but you could go in for protection of that against bombs or artillery and so on.
And they used it now as a prison. Of course it was totally damp -- yeah and the-there were
benches in there, but it was very damp and unpleasant. And -- and then there was a guard with a
gun at the exit. And the only reason to -- for anyone to go out is, if somebody had to do some
business and the guard who stood there knew only one German word, we were told and -- and
that is shisin, which is the German slang word, actually the total equivalent of, in English, means
shitting. So -- what did -- if -- if somebody had to go, then they was taken out and what they had
rigged up there is, between two trees, they had fastened a horizontal broom, at about sitting
height or chair height. And you just had to sort of sit over that broom, holding on with your
hands and do whatever you had to do and then go back again in-into that ditch. And after a few
hours, we were even brought some food. It was in -- in a bucket, which is used in Germany, or I
guess here too, for say, washing floors and th-they had in there some nondescript soup, with a
few pieces of meat sort of floating around in it... Yeah, then later that day, I mean that was all
still in the morning and then we get something at noon, that -- that food and then the afternoon,
somebody shouted down, “All Germans out.” Again, there were Germans and non-Germans that
they had collected them and the non-Germans were al-always the forced laborers that the
Germans had deported into Germany. But anyway, all Germans were called out and I
immediately decided, you know, I'm not a German and so I stayed in there. And they were
actually taken out to peel potatoes for the Russians, you know it was a fairly large group of
policemen and investigators and so on. And after they were finished, they were told, okay now
they can go home. Then I thought I could hit myself over the head. If I would have gone out with
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 159
the Germans, I would be out and free now. Well, it was a wrong guess. And then, the night came
and we had to sort of seat -- sleep sitting up on that -- that bench, in -- in that damp atmosphere
there, as well as one could and the next day, the next day the various people were called up for
more interrogation. Yeah and then I had sort of started up some sort of a talking
acquaintanceship with a Czech engineer, who had been taken by the Germans to work on some
war plant. And so he was called up and he -- he was brought down by the guard after whatever,
maybe a half an hour and he was hardly down and had sat down and he looked already very
disturbed, when another officer, who looked also extremely brutal, appeared with a -- he had sort
of a baton and -- and a sort of wooden stick in front, i-in his hand, waved it in front of that Czech
guy and shouted at him in Russian, something that didn't sound very pleasant. And when he was
gone, the Czech guy told me that the Russians, during the interrogation, told him that they have
evidence that he was not forcibly deported, but that he volunteered to work for the Germans. And
of course he denied that and it wasn't true, he said. And that guy who came down, shouted at
him, “If you don't admit the truth, that you volunteer t-to work for the Germans, you'll stay down
here until you starve of -- of -- of hunger.” And -- and th-then he told me yeah, I mean he -- he --
by the way, he knew Russian also, that Czech guy. He told me -- you know I had told him a little
bit about my story, that, “they probably won't believe that you are a Jew, either.” Anyway, later
that day, be -- before I was even interrogated, we were all called out and marched off. And I
thought now actually, that we are headed toward someplace where we were being shipped off
into the Soviet Union. And I was sort of looking around, whether there would be a way, quick --
make a quick escape. There was just -- there were two soldiers, one in front and one bringing up
the rear, each one with a gun who -- and it would have had to be somewhere where, you know,
they couldn't immedia -- anyway, it never came to that, we only walked about two or three
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 160
blocks and then we were asked to sit down on the street in front of an even bigger villa, which
was also occupied by these same green-hated soldiers. And then we were called up one by one
into the building for interrogation and some people actually, after they came out, left. Apparently
they were told to be free and others came back and joined us. And when -- when I was called in,
there were two interrogators and they struck me immediately, sort of totally different. But see the
Russians which I had come across so far, all were s-sort of looked pretty uncivilized and -- and --
and brutal in a sort of a raw way. These two guys, they also looked brutal, but they were well
shaved. They looked brutal, maybe sounds funny to say, in the SS way. They had elegant
uniforms, they talked fluent German, they seemed to be very educated, but -- made a ruthless
impression that way. But -- anyway they --they wanted to know, you know, who I am, which I
told them and then exactly as that Czech had predicted, they told me that they won't believe that I
am Jewish and in fact that they have some evidence that I had -- was working under orders to
blow up bridges to delay the Russian advance and how I could prove that I'm Jewish. And then I
s -- I told them, well you have my papers, you know th-they confiscated. Then they both
laughed, indicating, you know, these days, anyone has forged papers, so. And then I was sent
down into the basement of that villa. The basement was of course, concrete floor, covered with a
thin layer of straw and I was greeted there by a chorus of other Germans, “Ah, a-a new one
coming in.” And of course, in lying there with those guys I found out one of them was th-the
local Nazi party district leader, had sort of the same position as that guy that we had then. And I-
I said, sort of to myself, you know, what an irony, you know. Here I am in prison now, with guys
like those, like that. And -- and then we were also again fed some nondescript food and people
were constantly being called up for interrogation upstairs. And then night fell and then the guard
would periodically come into the cellar and shine a flashlight into people's faces, looking for a
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 161
particular individual and then gave in up and the next morning I was called up again and -- and
the same two guys were there and they immediately took me und-under sharp questioning and
said whether I had changed my mind and I'm willing to tell the truth now. And I told them that I
-- that I -- that is the truth and then one guy sort of walked up to me and said, “You know, I tell
you one thing, we have more -- too many of your types of Jews in the Soviet Union, and they're -
- you are all the same. You don't want to work, but you want others to work. You want other
people to work for you. If one thing, we'll teach you guys to -- how to work.” And then, with that
he lifted his jack-booted foot and gave me a -- a powerful kick into my rear end, “Now get
down.” And the guard took me down again. And then other people were called up and I forgot
whether there was a third night or not, but anyway, the next time I was called up, the guard who
did the bringing up, came into the basement, pulled his pistol a-and shouted into the room.
Usually he called by name, now he shouted, “Where is the Jew?” So I got up and he pulled his
pistol and said, “You are going to be shot now.” An-And that d-didn't sound real to me, because
they weren't shooting people there, you know? And anyway, as I-I walked ahead of him, he sort
of pressed the muzzle of his gun into my back, but somehow at that point I wasn't afraid, I-I-I-I
sort of felt that was just a ruse. And when I came up, there were these same two guys and they
again asked me whether I had a change in mind and whether I'm ready to tell them the truth. And
I -- I said, “That is the truth.” And then -- then they asked, “Well, how could you prove that you
are a Jew?” So I-I said, “Well, I know some Hebrew.” So upon which one of them rattled
something in -- in Yiddish. Then -- then I said, “But that wasn't Hebrew, that was Yiddish.” Then
he said, “Oh? What's the difference?” So I explained the difference to him and then he smiled
and then he said, “Well what -- what -- what do you -- what Hebrew do you know?” You know,
in -- in -- in that moment, the only thing I could think of was a Shema, which I recited. And then
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 162
they both laughed and then it suddenly struck me, these guys are Jews. And -- and then they were
Just instantaneously switched, they were extremely polite, told me to sit down and I must be
hungry after that ordeal and they -- they barked some orders at some guy outside. And it was in
five minutes he came with delicious rolls with s -- sausage and salami and -- and then we had a
conversation, then he asked me what I want to do and I told him werwidden. And then he said
well okay, I-I should get out of there an-and -- and go home. Now the thing is this, on the day --
that all started when I was looking for the -- when I was looking for the railroad station and I had
a light coat on and that coat, of course I had left downstairs in the -- in the cellar, in the
basement. But during the days that I was down there, you know, you hear all kinds of stories,
they were telling of -- of somebody who was released by the guys upstairs, who also had
forgotten some personal belongings in -- in the basement and said he wants to retrieve it, but the
guard had a change in mind, you know and -- and just told the guy he's not letting him out again,
even though the officer upstairs there. So I figured, to hell with my coat, I am free and that's
more important. But of course, in those days, even a coat, a simple coat was a -- somewhat of a
fortune, but my freedom was even more valuable. I-I forgot to mention, by the way, that when,
on the first day, when those Germans were asked to peel potatoes and then released, I managed
to tell one of them the address where the Haas family were living there in the orangery and to
notify them where I am, because you know, they had no idea. So when I came back, you know,
they knew over there, that guy had actually notified them and they had gone to Major Shike, you
know, hoping that all that needs to be done, that he has to pull some strings to get me out. And
when they told him where I was, he immediately backed off and said, “Well, there's nothing that
-- these guys knows wh -- know what they are doing,” and he cannot interfere. So, that's an
interesting sidelight on the system, was exactly the way with the Gestapo in -- in -- in -- in -- in
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 163
Nazi Germany of course. Okay, so anyway, after all of that, we knew that no trains were running
to Berlin, but that's where we wanted to get to. And then -- in the meantime, our bicycle of
course, had been stolen by the Russians. It was th -- after the watch, was the next thing. So I
couldn't even bicycle to Berlin, but I suggested that I walk to Berlin, was about, I forgot, must be
25 miles or so. And -- and go to the Templehoff district, where I had that room and sort of see
what's going on. So I walked there and right when I got there, I-I found out first of all, that the
Russians had already instituted a German civilian administration and in the borough, sort of city
or each -- yeah, Berlin has 20 boroughs, you know, th-that borough of Templehoff where that
apartment was in, then had its own city hall and so I went up there and I found out that they have
lists o-0-of -- of Nazis, particularly Nazis who had more prominent positions. And their
apartments are available for people who are returning from concentration camps, that were
persecuted. So the guy told me that all I have to do is ask for a list and I can pick the apartment I
want to have. And of course I didn't want to make a decision so I just stayed one night and then
walked back again and then there's another one or two days and then I -- I walked with
Margaret's father, Mr. Haas, to Berlin. There we had a -- another incident, while we were
walking on the -- this major highway, I mean that also goes through suburban city streets toward
Berlin. We saw already at a distance -- there was a big hospital there and -- and the Russians,
you could see were busy there, carrying equipment out. And -- but as we come closer, we could
see that they were basically Russian guards and German civilians carrying equipment. And so, as
-- as we got there, the Russian guard immediately enlisted us to also help carry out equipment
from the -- they were dismantling the entire hospital and we had to go in and carry out whatever
medical supplies and -- and so on.

End of Tape Seven, Side B
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 164
Beginning of Tape Eight, Side A
Q: This is tape three, side A, of an interview with Ermest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997. The
interviewer is Randy Goldman.
A: Yeah, so -- I mean, we were not exactly excited by this prospect, particularly since we figured
if they need us here to load that truck, somewhere they must have a railroad sighting, where the
truck then has to be unloaded into railroad cars and we didn't want to be taken there. Now again I
had really a unbelievable stroke of luck. It turns out that one of the nurses in that hospital, was a
nurse who at one time, my grandmother had -- I forgot for what reason my grandmother was
paralyzed toward the last years of her life. Anyway, she knew me and she knew our family. And
so I-I told -- we had a chance to chat and then she told us to -- when we ca -- to bring down now
whatever we were taking dow -- told to take down and when we come up, to see her in a certain
room number. So that's where we went and then she conducted us to some rear staircase, in the
rear of the building, that the Russians apparently hadn't been aware of, and which let out some
rear door to a side street, away from that main highway. And then she told us to walk down that
street, several blocks and then turn right and to come back again to the main highway, but sort of
out of sight of those g-guards there. So that's what we did, so. And -- okay, then we continued
and then when we came to Berlin, I went with my -- with Margaret's father to the -- to the city
office, where I had been a few days before and we were give -- given the list and then we started
to look at one or two apartments and actually liked one. There -- there was a mother, who was, I
guess she must have been probably around late 30's, maybe around 40, with two relatively small
children, maybe sort of around, maybe, a young teenager, I think a boy around 13 and a girl a
few years younger. And, you know, we identified ourselves as -- that we are Jews and that the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 165
Nazis had taken everything we -- away. Oh yeah, by the way, I'm sorry, I have to back up. The
official in the city hall also told us that the people, I mean, who -- apartments are vacated, are not
permitted to take anything with them, unless we give special permission. And t -- Margaret's
father sort of conducted the conversation and he told her that we are, of course, not like the Nazis
and any personal, I mean we don't want her clothing or -- or that of other family members and --
or personal items, but all furnishings, all kitchen utensils and those things, have to stay in the
apartment. And -- and to do it sort of on an honor code and we'll be back the next morning to
claim the apartment. So that's what we did, we came back the next morning, got a set of keys and
-- and then took possession of the apartment. And then I-I think through Major Shike or
somehow, we got a Russian military truck to take us along, who was going to Berlin anyway,
also with all our luggage. I mean you couldn't have -- yeah, I-I mean I-I-I skipped several things,
you know, when -- when I say I discussed, when we suddenly had to leave that village there
overnight and we hid all our suitcases in the shed of this elderly couple, Dwuzul. I don't -- I don't
know whether I mentioned their name, but their name is Dwuzul anyway. And I picked those up
by meeting them at a certain railroad station. So we had all our things with us by that time. And
of course there was no way how we could have gotten to Berlin, you know, with all that stuff if
we -- so anyway, that's how we got to Berlin. And then one sort of interesting after development,
I-I had discussed, quite a bit earlier, the former client of my father, who was also a furrier and
where I went to work once a week on his estate, so long, as a gardener in the fields. And I
mentioned that he had three Polish forced laborers there. A Polish couple and then a single
woman, Maria, who always, every time I came, invited me to her room and fed me and gave me
food along. And -- and who I sort of suspected that she might have a crush on me. Well, when I
visited the furrier [indecipherable] after the war, he told me an amazing story, he said when the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 166
Russians came, you know and he lived, of course in an area of big mansions and they were going
everywhere just emptying places out -- Maria went and sort of got a hold of the first Russian
officer and had a long conversation in Russian with him. As a result of which, the officer ordered
all his -- his troops away from this house and -- and on and he was, nothing happened to his
place. And then he -- he asked Maria, “What -- what did you tell him?” And, “I-I told him that
you are one of the few decent Germans, that you helped enemies of the regime and Jews.” And
then he said, ““What -- what Jews did I help?” Well, you know, I went -- I think I mentioned I
went there also under an assumed name. And the name I used there, by the way, was Tsarini.
There was some reason for that, but doesn't make a difference here. And -- and she said, “Wasn -
- Wasn't Tsarini Jewish?” And he laughed and said, “Of course he was, but how did you know?”
Then she said, “I know because I am Jewish. My name is not Maria at all. I -- I got Polish
papers. It was better to be deported to Germany for forced labor than to some concentration
camp and I-I immediately recognize a Jew.” And -- and when he told me the story, I felt really
dumb. That is -- that never occurred to me. And I often wondered what became of Maria, or
whatever her real name is. Well, it's an interesting sidelight.

Q: Let me ask you a question. At what point did you start hearing about all of the atrocities?

A: Oh yeah, okay. In a -- we heard from British broadcasting, BBC, that we occasionally -- yeah,
the -- the -- we -- we had a chance to listen to BBC at the house of this elderly couple, the
Dwuzuls, you know, who -- later were insulted that we hadn't informed them earlier who we
were, because they -- we had even before that, when we still pretended to be good German
Aryans, we had often been at their house listening to foreign broadcasts, mainly BBC, actually,
with them. And in fact I have to say that -- that was a big morale booster, just to listen to the
BBC. They did a lot for us just by having these broadcasts and -- and they -- their signal was
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 167
always -- it started out with the Morse Code signal for the letter V, for victory and -- and by
coincidence, these are also the first tacts of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. And -- and just
listening to -- to this signal was already a big morale booster. And of course we heard all kinds of
stories, that the Nazis kept from the population. And of course, as I had also said before, that was
punishable by execution if they found out someone was listening to foreign radio broadcasts. So
in a way, the Dwuzuls had a point, you know, they were totally in our hand, you know, we -- we
listened to these broadcasts there with them at their radio and --

Q: No, my question was --

A: Yeah?

Q: After you -- you were with the Russians, did people start streaming back?

A: Oh, no.

Q: Did you start hearing stories?

A: No, not -- I mean, all I was going to say -- that come from -- from Brit -- from BBC we heard
for the first time, I think maybe I said that before already, that hundreds of thousands of Jews are
being killed. Then -- no, i-it -- it took quite awhile. Actually, people slowly dribbled in. There
was a central registration place for Jews right after the war. In fact, that was at the Jewish
hospital, which was the last, sort of collection center for Jews for deportation. Then it was turned
over and -- and then was the first place where Jews could -- free Jews could collect again. And --
but since there was no public transport, that was at the opposite end of Berlin. Templehoff was in
the southern part of Berlin and that hospital in the northern part. It was a long walk of many
miles. I went there once a week, hoping to see a -- a well known name, but -- but didn't discover
anyone. The -- the first person who returned, whom I knew, from Auschwitz, was a high school
friend of mine, who in fact later also came to this country and was then, before his retirement, a
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 168
professor of mathematics at Ohio State University in Columbus, and -- where he is living now.
But he -- he was in Auschwitz and he came back and he told me basically, a lot of the things
also, a lot of the things that Elie Wiesel discussed in his book, “Night.” An-and -- I mean sort of,
I mean the -- the fact that millions of Jews had been systematically killed, I mean it -- because
then also other Jews came back, not just German Jews, also east European Jews who were
chased out then, from their own countries, mainly from Poland. As you may know, there were
pogroms in Poland against the returning Jews. And so, I don't know how soon we found out, but
within maybe weeks or months, we found out, although I mean, the total extent of it probably
might have taken longer, I-I don't know.

Q: But the stories --

A: Yeah, right.

Q: How bad it was?

A: Yeah, right -- that -- that came out. I-I-I would like to make a few sort of post-script
comments concerning the period of time before the start of World War Two. Because I-I
remember you had also asked me a question, you know, how that time affected me, at that time I
was just a teenager and of course the Nazis were then in power, since 1933. And what I would
like to say is, that there was an increasing atmosphere, sort of -- of -- of hostility against the Jews
in -- in all -- in the media, in p -- in -- in newspapers, in -- in the radio and so on. And -- and we
were, I mean, th-that I know I discussed also -- pictured as the worst criminals and as a --a sort of
tr-trying to undermine the German nation. Yeah. For example, one incident in -- in the apartment
building where we lived, the -- the beautiful one where we had that large apartment, there were
only two parties on each floor. And on the same floor there was another couple, the husband was
also a lawyer, but they were Aryans, I mean Germans and they had a daughter, just one, single
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 169
child, a daughter my sister's age. And the grandmother, one of the grandmother also lived with
them. And my sister and that girl were very close friends, they played together, and of course
they went to school together then, when they came to school and so on. And one day the girl told
my sister that her grandmother had forbade her from now on, to have a Jewish friend. So she is
sorry, but she can't come over any more and can't have her over. You know, things like that.
Then, each apartment building was assigned a Nazi party, sort of representative for that building
and the man who was the representative in our building, for example, made it a point, whenever
we crossed paths, see, in the house entrance, in the elevator or wherever, to ostensibly sort of
look in a very hostile way and ignoring us, not greeting us. And a few other tenant, not all of
them, but a few other tenants followed suit. Then, as the 30's wore on and the Nazis really started
openly to prepare for war, they also started an extensive air raid protection system, with building
air raid shelters in basements and so on. And one of the early orders was that Jews are not
permitted to join the other tenants in an air raid shelter. So we had to go -- ea-each tenant also
had a little lockable area, sort of separated by -- by wooden planks, to store things, for storage.
And we had to sit in there like pariahs, while the rest of the tenants walked by there into their air
raid shelter, which was, you know with benches and so on. And there was -- I mean there were
constant speeches, of course, which were insulting and hostile to us and -- and people, even
people who were not ill-meaning, felt that it was dangerous even, to be seen -- to associate with
Jews. And then there were, they had frequent Nazi holidays or other holidays. They u -- every
opportunity they -- then there were the Olympic games and so on. And o-of each time they made
a big fuss about marches. That -- that was sort of one of their favorite activities. SS units, SA
units, Hitler youth units, would march, you know, looking really snappy and snifty, with flags
flying and with bands playing and singing their songs. And it was sort of, in retrospect, almost
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 170
like a -- almost continuous holiday atmosphere and by that time of course, as the 30's went on,
everybody was employed. You know, Germany had a tremendous unemployment rate before, as
part of the world wide great depres-depression. And of course they were all employed, basically
re-arming Germany, but we didn't know it at that time. But, I mean, that was the thi -- that's --
that's how they solved the unemployment problem and also their own military, what they
conceived as inferiorit-inferiority, and --

Q: You mentioned the Olympics.

A: Yeah.

Q: Did you go to any of that?

A: Yeah, well actually, I went to two events. I went -- one was the final for the gold medal of
soccer. I went with my mother, she -- my mother was very interested in sports, my father
couldn't have cared less. So she went with me and the final game was between Italy and Austria
and it was a very exciting game, they were, at that time, the power houses in -- in -- in soccer.
And actually Germany also had a pretty good team, but was already out of the running by that
time. And what happened is the -- at that time of course, Austria was still an independent
country, otherwise they wouldn't have had a team. And -- but the Germans of course, felt kinship
with the Austrians, so the -- the stadium sort of rooted for the -- for the Austrians. The Italians
had bought, sort of blocks, large blocks of seats, where they were sitting in their black Fascist
uniforms and were waving Italian flags and they must have had some sort of a cheerleader. They
would -- at -- at some particular moment, maybe when Italy was on a drive, they would jump up,
like on a command and shout, I mean in Italian, “Italia, Italia, Italia,” and waving their flags.
And then the rest of the stadium would thunder back, “Ustarashe, Ustarashe,” is the German
word for Austria. “Ustarashe, Ustarashe.” So it was that constant back and forth between these
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 171
blocks of Italians who shouted Italia and most of the rest of the stadium shouting Ustarashe. And
Q: Was that alarming at all or was it exciting?

A: No, th-that was an excite -- that was an excite -- excite, I mean of course there were political
undertones, but I mean, Italy was, by that time already, an ally of Germany, so there was no, it
wasn't as if say Britain had been, you know then the --

Q: There was a certain energy --

A: Yeah.

Q: At the '36 Olympics --

A: Oh, yeah, I mean --

Q: Maybe you can talk about --

A: Yeah IJ-I mean that was, I mean, incredible. First of all, they -- they toned down somewhat,
their antisemitism. That was probably on pressure from the west, although there wasn't much of
that pressure as far as I can see. But the whole city was sort of -- was first of all renovated. The --
the -- the elevated lines got totally new trains. You know, it's that line that ran by that synagogue
also, that was burned down a few years later. And -- and in fact those -- those cars are still in use
now, that is now 60 years later. Unbelievable. I mean now they -- they look worn and so on. And
-- and several stations, like the -- in -- in central Berlin and -- and -- and western Berlin, the
central station is -- is a zoo station, because it's near the zoo. And that was totally rebuilt and --
and lots of other things, I mean were done to the city. I mean -- I mean the Nazis used that --
went all out of their way and -- and the interesting -- when I came to this country, and went to
college here, in the year 1949, so that was only 13 years after the Olympics. I was at a small
college in Missouri, where I had a scholarship. Southwest Missouri State College, in Springfield,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 172
Missouri. And my German t -- not my German, she was a German professor there, a woman and
I-I was actual -- at her request, I was active in the German club. Ther-There was a club for
students who wanted to major in German and practice German and -- and she had asked me to go
there too, so they can sort of converse with me in German. And then I often talked with her also,
and she said she was in Germany in '36 to the Olympics. At that time she was a young, I don't
know, whatever, assistant professor or something and -- and she said she was impressed -- the --
the courtesy, the -- the -- we -- how well everything was planned, the efficiency and also the
party, the party hogans were also enlisted. They were all very nice, you know, the-they -- it -- it's
fairly hard for people to understand. I mean y -- you can -- you could, even SS officers and
sometimes the most brutal types, could be very charming and courteous and polite and they were
all double faced and -- so the Olympic games, from that point of view, were a huge success, I
mean. And of course, also, Germany did very well, I mean the Nazis had a tremendous system of
physical training and -- and sports facilities and so on and I think in medals they won that game,
far -- at least they claimed to, I forgot the details. But anyway, coming back to that soccer game,
they -- the way soccer was played at that time at least, it was a draw at the official end of the
game and I think it was one to one. And then the rule was that the game is extended until sudden
death. In other words, one party shoots a goal and that ends the game and that party of course
then wins. And -- And it was Italy that shot that additional goal, so it was two to one for Italy,
and they got the gold medal and the Austrians got the silver then. But my father was -- my -- my
mother was very interested in -- in sports, though not just spectator sports, but she did a lot also
to entice me to -- I was originally totally averse to any sports, I didn't like it and often was afraid
of things and she had a tremendous energy and -- and sort of practically forced me how -- to
learn how to swim, to ski and to skate, I mean ice skate and bicycle. And I do most of these
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 173
things -- for swimming I don't care too much anymore. I find it too boring just to swim bac-back
and forth in a lap, but -- but I mean, I-I'm able to swim and -- but I-I still love skiing and --

Q: [indecipherable]. Why don't you continue?

A: Yeah. Incidentally, the Olympics was the first occasion when I saw Hitler in person. We -- we
lived -- the street we lived on in that ap-apartment was the major east - west sort of boulevard,
that cut through, it started at the center of Berlin, actually near the Rice chancellery and then
went for several miles, to the western outskirts where we lived. And the Olympic stadium was
also near where we lived, so Hitler passed by there on -- on opening day to open the games. And
of course, his trip out to the Olympic stadium itself, was planned as a big theater. They had the
streets lined with enthusiastic crowds and SS, sort of in -- information, holding them back. And
then Hitler would ride in an open Mercedes-Benz, in uniform, standing stiffly upright and
periodically raising his right arm to the Hitler salute, greeting the masses. And as I stood on the
balcony, just looking straight down at Hitler, the thought occurred to me how easy it would be
just to assassinate him from here. The next time I saw him, was exact -- about a year later, when
Mussolini played his state visit to Berlin in 1937. And in fact, during that state visit, the Berlin-
Rome axis was sort of cemented. And Mussolini, the arrangement was also for them to ride into
town, so in the opposite direction now, from the -- from a suburban railroad station, which was in
fact just half a mile away from where our house was. And then they rode into town, again
greeting the masses that were lined up behind rows of SS. And there was an interesting contrast.
Hitler, the unsmiling, stiff despot and Mussolini, the typical, jovial Italian. He also raised his
hand, but he raised it in a much more informal way. He -- his mouth was widely open and -- and
laughing and smiling and his body would sort of -- in body language, wave back and forth from
one side to the other, acknowledging crowds on both sides. Was a tremendous difference in the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 174
appearance of these two dictators. I'm not trying to make Mussolini appear any -- like a nice
uncle, but there was a tremendous difference between these two men, both were equally brutal.
In -- in summary, I mean, I-I must say that I -- th-the years in the 30's, leading up to World War
Two and the Holocaust, I felt, I mean basically like an outsider, like b-being, I mean pushed
away from the main body and from all the festivities that the Germans enjoyed, from which I
was excluded. But on the other hand, I had found my inner Jewish belonging, mainly as a result
of the school that I went to and which gave me inner strength and to some extent compensated
for that. One final remark I would like to make concerning the question of the deportations. The
deportations of course, were ordered by the Gestapo and go back directly to an order by
Heidrish, who was ordered by Hitler, was given by Hitler the -- the order to carry this out. But
the -- at the local level, the deportations were organized by the Jewish community organizations.
And of course that has been a big problem ever since it happened. For -- for me personally, I felt
-- first of all, totally abandoned, I must say, by the -- knowing that the Jewish organizations were
organizing the transports. Infer it got to the point where I actually considered the leadership of
the Ricefinegunk -- that was the sort of umbrella organization of Jews in Germany -- I
considered them as part of the enemy and they had to be considered that way. On the other hand,
of course, we know now much more, there were very difficult moral decisions and there were
very difficult also, options available. I certainly would never want to be in a position to make
those choices. But it -- but th-th-th-the fact remains that for me at the time, I -- I felt really as
being abandoned by my own leadership and -- and -- and it -- it probably needs to be considered
more deeply now, where we have some distance, what the options were that these people had and
what they could have done, other than what they actually did.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 175
Q: I'm wondering how long you remained in Berlin, what your plans were and how easy or
difficult it was to realize those plans.

A: Yeah, briefly, my first priority was to get on with my education and I immediately enrolled in
the technical university in Berlin and then later took courses also in the main university, or
Humboldt University, as that was then renamed, li -- taking lectures in mathematics, physics and
so on. There were many famous professors who had still survived the war. And of course there --
there were then also a number of Jews who had returned, or some of them actually had survived
in Berlin as -- as mixed -- children of mixed marriages. You know, where one parent was Gentile
and the other one was Jewish. And of course there was a large number of German army veterans.
And that in fact, was a very sore point. Many of them were still very nationalistic, in spite of that
hu-huge defeat. So I-I-I enrolled in those courses and actually Margaret's mother immediately
opened a sort of office, on her own, for social help for Jews returning from concentration camps.
And she worked closely together with the American official who was in charge of that borough,
Templehoff. A -- I think a captain or major Davidhoff, or Davidhoff. It turns out supposedly, that
that man was a Communist and was then later rotated out and sent home. And when -- when the
first possibility arose for emigrating to the United States, that was in '46 and we registered, it
turned out that Margaret's mother somehow was on the black list, because she had closely
collaborated, and that Major Davidho-Davidhoff also for example, was helpful in providing
apartments for returning Jews and etcetera, etcetera. And so we were, for about a year, subjected
to a lot of chicanery by the American consulate. I remember th-the consul himself was a Mr.
Haney and -- who was a very unpleasant character and I was once, I'm sure on -- on his orders,
although I can't prove it, interrogated by an officer of the CIC. The CIC is the army's criminal
investigation commission or some -- and -- and that interrogation took place in the following
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 176
way, that the interrogating officer sat behind a desk and next to him was a growling German
Shepherd, who was there just to intimidate me and they wanted to know, you know, about I --
wanted me to incriminate Margaret's parents, basically, as -- as Communists. And -- you know
and when I -- when I couldn't say anything incriminating, you know he -- he let me go, finally.
But he -- it was a very unpleasant interview, or interrogation is the better word. I did receive,
finally, my visa, but the Haas family did not and at that point, since we had lived through thick
and thin through the war, I decided to let my visa lapse, even though I was told by the -- and I
told the consul I will go when the others will go. The consul said that there's no guarantee that I
will ever get my visa renewed if I let it lapse once. And -- and I had an uncle here in the United
States who also implored me to -- to come -- to come and let -- wait here for them. Anyway -- by
the way, that's a interesting thing, my -- my first connection to -- to friends, you know there was
no postal connection, of course, between Germany and any country outside. So we went to --
there was a huge barracks of American soldiers near where we lived and I remember I went to
the guard soldier outside and asked whether he could tell me whether there was a Jewish soldier
somewhere. It's such an outlandish idea. So -- so he directed me, pointed to some particular room
and there was a Sergeant Roth, R-o-t-h. So I went to that Roth and told him who I was and that I
survived and -- and I had a-an address of a school friend in Connecticut and my uncle. And --
and -- and actually I didn't -- he was in New York, but I didn't have his exact address, but I had
some connecting address in London, who could then forward it. And -- and so he also conversed
with me, that Roth and he -- he asked me where -- he -- no, he didn't ask me, he warned me not
to try to emigrate to the United States because there are -- were already too many Jews there and
-- and was rising antisemitism and now that the Nazis were gone and the war was over, it would
be much better for me also if I stayed in Germany. And I found that so unbelievably
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 177
preposterous, he was an American Jew, telling me not to come here. But anyway, I didn't follow
his advice, but what he did do, is he di -- he did forward my mail and the letter that I read to my
school friend, wound up as an article, he submitted it -- there's a German-Jewish weekly called
“Oufbow.” By now it's a biweekly. And it was published in there and -- and my -- my uncle then
also f -- supported me. Finally we did get visas. Th-The joint was extremely helpful there, they --
the joint opened offices in Berlin and with their help, the three of us finally got visas and we
arrived here on the 22nd of June, 1947. And -- and then my -- my first priority again here, was to
study.
End of Tape Eight, Side A

Beginning of Tape Eight, Side B
Q: This is tape three, side B, of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997.
A: Yeah. After my arrival, my first priority, as I said, was to continue my studies. My uncle
provided the financial support in the beginning, for a-a few months. And then -- I lived in New
York then. He had rented for me a furnished room in the upper West Side. And then I took a job
as a messenger boy on 48th -- West 48th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, for an outfit
called Action Messenger Service. We were a whole bunch of young guys who were lined up and
the boss would always call one after the other to run certain errands. For me that was great, that's
how I got to know New York. I -- he sent me to one address to pick up a package to be delivered
to a second address and I got to know New York from downtown Wall Street to midtown and
even further uptown and I really fell in love with the city at that time. In the evening -- and by --
incidentally, I earned 50 cents an hour. And in the evening, I took two or three courses, I forgot,
in City College. And -- and I took some elementary physics, which I already had in Germany,
Just in order to get up to speed also with the English language and with the technical expressions.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 178
And I also had a course in calculus, which I -- also mostly was just review of what I had already
learned in Germany. And I -- my goal, of course, was to become a full-time student and
financially that wouldn't have been possible for me. So through a friend of mine, I was referred
to a committee with the interesting name, American Committee for Emigré Writers, Scholars and
Artists. And was sort of an interesting outfit. Basically what they did is this, they did not have
any money themselves, they served as a clearing house for available grants, fellowships and so
on. So I registered with them and after, I forgot what it was, a few months -- I should say also, I
had only A's from my first two semesters in City College, so that obviously helped along. And
they told me that they had a Rotary international scholarship for Southwest Missouri State
College, in Springfield, Missouri. I never heard of the place before and of course I didn't know at
that time that there were such huge disparities between different academic institutions. But
anyway, I went there and I credit my two years in Springfield, Missouri and at that college,
mainly with my Americanization. And one thing that bothered me in New York is that the only
social contact I had was not just with other German Jews, but mainly only with Berlin Jews.
Former Berlin Jews I should say, I should say. But -- and I realized that if I want to become
acculturated in my new country, I can't just have a s -- a social life only with people from the old
country. And -- but it was very difficult in City College, leadto -- I tried several times
unsuccessfully. It's a commuter college, people come, take classes and rush away. Go back into
the subway and go to Brooklyn or God knows where. And so it's not really a campus
atmosphere. So when I got that scholarship, I took a train off to Springfield, Missouri and yeah --
and I should say that my friends, the Haas family, they --after some initial difficulty, settled in --
in New York and Margaret's father got several jobs, improving as time went on, in the garment
industry as designer, pattern maker and so on, in ladies garments. Of course we stayed in contact
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 179
as I went to Springfield. And there I was received by the dean, who felt that it would be a good
idea if I would be put -- housed in the barracks, which had been built on campus for GI's. That
was the time of the GI Bill of Rights, after World War Two and there was such an influx of
students that they needed to do something to -- to house them. And so th-these barracks were
built. They were relatively primitive, but as far as I was concerned, totally sufficient. And of
course, there I learned all the slang that I hadn't learned in all my years of English in the German
high school, including all the four letter words, which I hadn't known before. And -- and in
general got sort of acculturated to life in a small, Midwestern town. As the -- coincidence would
have it, also the -- the dean, right away set me in touch with the local rabbi. And it turned out that
rabbi also was a form-former German Jew. He was -- he wa -- had been rabbi in the Bavarian
city of Oxbourg before the war and now he was rabbi in Springfield, Missouri and he and his
family took me somewhat under their wings. I -- I was often invited to Shabbat evening dinners
at their house and obviously each time for the Seder. And so I lived with them -- but -- not lived
with, I mean I socialized with them and on the other hand, I also had American contacts and I
even made dates with American girls. And so -- and -- and my school performance turned out to
be very well. I did very well in all classes, so when I graduated then in -- in 1950, with a
Bachelor's Degree, I got an offer, actually several offers, but the one that I accepted for graduate
school was from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Admission to graduate school,
plus a guaranteed sort of teaching assistantship in the physics department. And so, in the summer
of 1950 isa, I got my Bachelor's Degree. That was in July, but I remained a bachelor then for less
than a month. But o-on the sixth of August, Margaret and I finally got married. And that was in
New York and -- and then we moved together to -- to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where I started
my graduate studies. That graduate studies turned out, unfortunately extended for more years
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 180
than I had originally anticipated, and is customary, for a number of reasons. I had some bad luck
with my first thesis subject and so on, but I don't want to go into that here now, but I -- o-of
general interest is maybe that in the s -- in the -- in my first summer there, it was the summer of
'51, [had a summer job at Bethlehem Steel Company, which is in the same city as Lehigh
University. And the company -- in fact the steel plant, I think the company still exists, but the
steel plant doesn't exist anymore. But I saw a steel plant from the inside and I found all of that
very interesting. How steel is being made and so on. And then two years later, in '53, I had a
summer job at White Sands proving ground. That was a rocket proving ground before anyone
even knew that the United States was deeply involved in rocketry. At that time, they just shot --
shot captured German V2 rockets. And some clever physicist had gotten the idea to -- while
these rockets are being shot with harmless warheads, just to test their flight characteristics, why
not put some instruments on the -- in -- in the warhead, to measure properties in the upper
atmosphere, ionosphere. And actually I was hired partly to write a sort of research paper on
certain aspects on how to detect cosmic rays. And so that filled my summer and I didn't realize at
that time, that in fact space physics would at one time become my life's profession. In 1954, the
following summer, I spent -- I had a special fellowship for -- to Brookhaven, the national
laboratory, which at that time was the foremost laboratory for -- in the world, not only this
country, for high energy physics. And th-there was a machine that could accelerate particles to
unheard of -- at that time -- energies, and cause all kinds of interesting effects and collisions.
And I worked with some famous physicists there, I -- I met, among others there, Enrico Fermi,
who -- the famous Italian physicist and Nobel prize winner and several others. And -- and then I-
I wrote a f -- a thesis, back at Lehigh University in a fairly esoteric, purely mathematical subject
in theoretical physics, involving fundamental particles and -- and field theory. I graduated in
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 181
1960 and by that time already, we had two children. I-I-I should have mentioned that after we
married, in August 1950 and moved to Bethlehem, Margot worked for a number of years in an
office and in 1955, she was pregnant with our son, Claude, who was born in August, '55 and --
and then in -- in O-October '59, our daughter Eva was born. And in '60, she was less than a year
old, we moved from Bethlehem to Ann Arbor, Michigan. And in Ann Arbor, I have worked --
actually I was for two years in the radiation laboratory and the radiation laboratory sort of started
to fold and go downhill. And then I obtained an offer from the space physics research laboratory
in 1962, where I -- I stayed until my retirement in 1992. I -- during that time I had a also varied,
interesting career. I attended many international meetings, including one in 1971, in Moscow,
which interested me very much. I-I should add, incidentally, that I taught myself the Cyrillic
alphabet during my two years -- postwar years in Berlin, from '45 to '47. Because the Russians
immediately after their arrival, one of the first things -- they put under the German street names,
the -- the name in R-Russian -- in Cyrillic letters, so that their soldiers could orient themselves in
the city. And simply by comparison and also by -- by knowing the Greek alphabet, which I knew
from the gymnasium, I -- I could figure out the entire alphabet, so going to Moscow in -- in'71,
at least I wasn't lost. I could read street names and so on. In '72 I attended an international
conference in Warsaw, which -- an-and just shortly before that time, I had read several diaries
and reports about Warsaw ghetto, including the uprising. And the visit to Warsaw was a
emotionally very shattering experience for me. I -- I spent every free minute that I was not at the
meeting, walking around the streets of the ghetto and -- which I all knew, from the books and --
that I'd read. And -- and observed and of course -- this is well known, the ghetto was totally
destroyed by the Germans after they captured it and -- and then the Poles completely leveled
everything that was left and then built sort of a worker's apartment in a style which I call
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 182
Socialist Modern. Which means modern lines, but shoddy construction. And -- and I-I just
walked through the streets and in my mental eye, saw in front of me, the Jews who lived there,
only a few years before. It was there 30 years later that I was there, which is nothing, in history.
In -- in '70, let me see, in '78 I spent a year, I'm sorry, I spent a summer in Paris. I -- a --a former
student of mine actually, w-who got his PhD u-under my supervision in the late '60's. Was a
French fellow, with whom I had an also personal friendship and we stayed in touch and he was
probably one of my most successful students. He -- by now he is director of a big laboratory in
Toulouse, but at that time he was already head of a group and he invited me to spend the summer
of '78 there and I went there with Margot and our daughter Eva, who at that time -- '78, what was
she doing then? She must have been a college freshman. And -- and that was marv -- we lived
really like -- like French people. We rented a furnished apartment and Margaret and Eva, during
the day, went of course to visit museums and sights around the streets and -- and on weekends
we did things together. It was a -- one of m -- the best summers we had. And in '76, by the way, I
had a summer position at the space physics laboratory of the University of California and
Berkeley. That was where we -- we made a cross country trip by car, which is the only way to
see this country, is really by driving through it. It's fascinating how the landscape changes, the
architecture changes and so on. And on the fourth of July, actually -- we -- we first visited
friends in San Diego and Los Angeles and on the fourth of July we drove up from L.A. to -- to
San Francisco. And of course the fourth of July is Independence Day, obviously and in '76 it was
the 200th anniversary of the United States. But in addition to that, it was also the day where
Israeli commandos liberated the prisoners in Entebbe. And we were driving along and listening
to the radio, you know, just for diversion, when suddenly a newsflash came on that Israeli
commandos had liberated the passengers of a -- I think it was an Air France plane with Israeli
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 183
and also other citizens on it. And so that was a perfect way for us to celebrate Independence Day.
And -- and then in the evening, after we arrived in Berkeley, we were told that already ahead of
time, that there's always a big firework over San Francisco Bay and the best way to view it is
from the -- from the eastern side of the bay, from Berkeley, in other words, th-the space physics
lab is on -- on -- on a -- on a mountain where also the radiation lab is located. And it was a
tremendous experience to see the fireworks over San Francisco Bay on the fourth of July, 1976.
Well --

Q: Let me ask you a few questions.

A: All right.

Q: Okay? What -- what -- when you look back, I mean you've now had a lot of time and you --
you're rela -- you're fairly reflective. What sort of long term impact did these early experiences
have on you, on the -- on the way you've lived your life, on your general outlook or the way
you've raised your kids? Could you talk about that?

A: Yes. I mean, it had a tremendous impact and in fact the impact increased as the years went by.
I -- I mean the fact that my parents, my sister and my first girlfriend, plus innumerable other
people I knew or I didn't know, just vanished and were brutally murdered because of some
unbelievable ideology which somebody cooked up, is so unna -- it -- it -- it's even for me today
not understandable, how that could have happened. And I have been sort of totally more and
more absorbed by it as the year went by. I -- I read -- I have, I mean innumerable books, some of
them I haven't even read yet, on the Holocaust. I mean starting with the standard works by -- by
Hillburg and what's her name? Yahyah Hill, the Israeli Estroyen and also Lucy Davidovitch and
so on. But in addition to that, all kinds of -- of special works by authors on special subjects like
the Warsaw ghetto. I own a number of diaries, including Rhea Blumes, notes and -- and on -- on
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 184
-- also on -- on -- on German Jews and I -- of course fascinated particularly by the fate of -- of
German Jews, because that's what I am and I was totally raised in Germany and -- and how that
could have happened, of all countries, in that country, is something that I -- I have wrestled with
all the -- for years and years and have not really come to a conclusion. What it really was that
gave rise to this unbelievable crime and you know that was com -- also it was committed by
people who were mostly highly educated and although there were some uneducated at the lower
levels, but at the higher levels they were of -- Goebbels was a PhD and -- and -- and many other
people and -- who -- who are not that well known, but were in high positions, were highly
educated. And to plan a mass murder on that scale and carry it out is -- is totally mind boggling
and so -- and -- and then another thing is that the fate of my immediate family is -- I'm -- I'm
trying to picture my father, even on the -- on the de -- on the deportation train. I mean how -- I-I-
I mean going into such de-detail as y-you know that each -- each railroad car where people were
transported and they were basically freight or cattle cars, had just -- somewhere -- big bucket
where people could relieve themselves. I couldn't -- I can't even believe how -- how anyone
would even be able to relieve themself in public, with everybody standing around, in a bucket in
the middle. The -- the idea, to humiliate Jews to such an unbelievable extent and how my father
even -- an-and then, on the day that they left, the temperatures were -- I mean Berlin in winter
was anyway cold, I think now it's not as cold any more, but at that time it was much colder, but
that was an unusually cold day, even for that time. I-I checked the meteorological records again,
to -- and have that at home, actually. And to -- to -- to reconfirm, that was just my memory, but it
-- were extremely cold days j -- and of course the cars were unheated and -- and how my family
was treated after they arrived in Auschwitz, or that they went to Auschwitz, that is a matter of
record. And my friend Ruth, I think, was deported to Riga and from -- but I -- from what little I
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 185
know, it may have happened that they were immediately transported by truck into some forest
and shot. And s-so I-I have been -- as the years went by I have more and more occupied myself
with that. For example, I was instrumental in Ann Arbor, to start a annual sort of observance of
Yom HaShoah, which has been now going on for over 10 years. And I was also involved -- Ann
Arbor has a statue now, commemorating the Holocaust, where I was involved in -- both in
raising the money and in getting the idea through, it's a -- the -- the artist who made the statue is
Leonard Baskin, who, by the way, also made one of the statues of the new FDR memorial here.
And so I'm -- I-I must say that I am -- m-my -- yeah then -- did you ask me how I raised m --
what affect of raising my children and -- and in two ways. First of all, I have always talked to
them about that period and -- and in -- in 1981 in fact, that was when our son graduated from --
from law school in Michigan and our daughter was actually still a year away from -- from
graduation, but we proposed sort of for them, a joint graduation gift, that's a trip to Europe, sort
of as students like to do it, sort of to bum around. They could select where they wanted to go,
sort of and you know, hos -- youth hostels and so on, with one proviso. In '81, I was at an
international meeting, I think in June or so, in Edinburgh, Scotland. And I-I suggested that we
meet in Berlin on -- on a certain week, so that Margot and I could show them where we grew up,
respectively and also where we went to school and other places of relevance to -- in our lives.
And so that's what we did, we actually -- after -- from Edinburgh, you know, we flew to Berlin.
The kids had already left earlier. They had decided first to make a brief swing through parts of
Scandinavia, they were in Copenhagen, then southern Sweden, okay and then they went into
Berlin. We met there and spent a week there and we -- we sh -- went also to the cemetery where
some of our forebears, gros grandparents and so on, are buried. And some famous German Jews.
In Germany the gravestones are also more, sort of descriptive, I mean you can really see who
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 186
somebody was. I mean it explains -- somebody may have been professor of this or that at this
university or -- or may have been an architect or whatever. Anyway -- and -- and then -- the rest
of the time they continued then, on their own. So, coming back to your question, I mean I -- I
saw to it, but I also w-we wanted to make them also very conscious of their Jewish heritage and
Margot and I often feel, that in that respect maybe we didn't do too great a job. We had -- we sort
of totally relied -- we are members of a conservative synagogue and of course, you know, money
constraints being what they are, they can't really hire first rate teachers, so they usually use
college students who come from more or less religious homes, to teach sort of the standard
things in elementary Hebrew and Biblical history and so on. But they still, they are -- our
daughter now even, is taking now here a course in basics of Judaism, I think, at the DCJCC.

Q: Wh-what what I'm asking is maybe a little bit more subtle. It's, do you think that you acted
differently than you might have? Do you think that you have certain values or you instilled
certain values --

A: Oh, okay.

Q: As a result of your experiences?

A: Yes. Okay, that -- thank you for raising that question. I was -- I-I was never only concerned
exclusively with the Jewish faith, although this is obviously the one that's closest to me, but I
was always appalled, I mean for example, also, with the treatment of blacks here in this country,
or Afro-Americans. And I-I have been always quite active in -- in -- in Ann Arbor there. I mean
today’s -- seems long ago, but there was at one time strict housing segregation and there was a
large group in which I was involved, for passage of city ordinances, to make such segregation
illegal, particularly by real estate agents, loan practices by banks and so on. And I took the
children sometimes along to demonstrations, I mean just to -- and they are both -- both of our
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 187
children -- E-Eva, our daughter, is involved now in the Hunger Coalition here, which
incidentally my wife is also very much involved, in Ann Arbor. And our son is involved with the
Anti-defamation League and such organizations. So we always instilled in them that it is
important for everybody to work for equality, not just for yourself or your own group, but for all
groups.

Q: Were there certain, or are there certain fears that have stuck with you as a result of your
experiences?

A: Very, very seldom, I have some dreams or some thoughts. I mean I -- I just recently, when I
woke up earlier in the morning than I-I should have probably, I thought of that incident with that
civilian police guy who stopped me on the subway and where I ask myself the question, what if
my assessment was wrong and my lingering around there would have caused him -- he could
have, any time while I was at that newspaper kiosk, pretending to look at newspapers, he could
have tapped on my shoulder and said, “Why don't you come along, I want to ask you some more
questions.” And then, that would have been the end of me. And -- and sort of I elaborated on that
in my fantasies. I w --

Q: I mean there are people who probably wouldn't have gotten -- wouldn't ride a subway today,
do you know what I mean?

A: Yeah.

Q: I'm trying to --

A: Oh, yeah. Oh, no.

Q: If there are certain -- certain images, certain sounds that really trigger memories for you?

A: Yeah.

Q: Ina very powerful way?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 188
A: Well actually, it's not a memory, it's sirens -- for two reasons. First of all, they signaled air
raids, but they also, you know my father was basically abducted, that's what the correct word for
that would have been. And normally, you would call the police and -- and they would come with
their sirens blaring and whenever I hear sirens, particularly in a police car, sometimes I've
actually -- tears are welling, thinking of it. They should have come and rescued my parents, they
were being abducted in broad daylight. And -- and I visited -- I visited by now, Auschwitz four
times and that is also a -- something I still have not come to -- to grips with. But in general, I --
in my day to day life, fortunately, I have not had any, I mean to my knowledge at least, any sort
of real strong emotional effects of, I mean like you say, not wanting to ride subways or things.
Q: Is there anything else you want to add, because I think we've covered a lot and --

A: Yeah. I mean actually, o-one thing that I wanted to say and forgot, that in one of the earlier
tapes, I think I made some mistakes in two dates. One is that highacoo -- high school friend of
mine, at one point I said -- left Berlin to emigrate to England on January 18, 1938. Now, in
context that of course could not have been in -- in -- as I explained at the time. His parents were
Austrians and in January '38, Austria still was an independent country. Ex-Excuse me. Austria
was occupied in March '38 and so then they lost their protection. And he left Ger -- actually
Berlin on January 18, '39. In other words, about three quarters of a year after Austria lost its
independent. The second date correction, the arrest of my girlfriend Ruth. I said at one time, it's
November 9, '41. That -- also th -- in November -- I-I'm sorry, September 9, '41, I said. The first
deportation left Berlin only at the end of September '41 and she was deported on September 9,
'42, not '41. I mean that's just -- it doesn't change anything, but to correct the misstatement.

Q: Any overall thought or statement you'd like to make?

A: Well --
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0450 189
Q: Doesn't have to be specific, but just any --
A: Yeah. I would think really two or three things. One of them is that there is a lot of basic value
in Judaism and that it's sort of incumbent on us to really familiarize ourselves with it. 1 mean
there -- for many Jews in this country, there has been sort of -- the Holocaust has been treated
almost like a substitute religion, particularly in recent years and I think that is almost sick. I think
the Holocaust must be remembered, of course, but not as a -- in the sense of a religion, but in the
sense that we, first of all should remember always, just like we remember other events in our
history, going back to Masada, to the destruction of the two temples and so on and also to learn
from it. Learn what to do and also what not to do. The other thing is, that aside from Judaism, I --
I also don't believe that one should be focused 100 percent on one's Judaism. Like I know there
are such Jews, but that since we are living in a -- in a broader world, that it is also the duty of
everyone to involve him or herself in the daily politics. To fight for what is right and to fight for
-- ag-against injustice, also against other groups. I think that is -- that is one thing th-th-that is
important, I mean the -- there is a famous, by now it's a cliché, quote -- I think it is from the
German, “Pustor Nimala.” At -- at first they came after the Communists -- I mean the Nazis, I
didn't particularly care because I wasn't a Communist. Then they went after the Jews and didn't
b-bother me either, I'm not a Jew. Then they went after homosexuals and didn't bother me, I'm
not a homosexual. Then they went after Catholics, that didn't bother me and when they came
after me, there was nobody left.
Q: Thank you.
A: You're welcome
