ISRAEL GRUZIN
June 30, 1994

Q: Can you tell us your name and where and when you were born?

A: I would be delighted. My name is Israel Gruzin. I born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, they
say in a place I born in 1928, December the 28th but now I am putting myself on May the
4th, and I am going to tell you the story.

Q: You're going to tell us the story later?

A: Right.

Q: Tell us a little bit about your life in Slobodka and about your family and your brothers
and sisters, if you have any?

A: Thad a brother, of course. I was born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, in Vilijampole. We had a
normal life. My father was not a millionaire but he made a nice living. He was doing
some business with Russians and things like this, and it was binders from boot sales and
selling this from the houtgarba(ph) to make leather out of it. | was going to school. I was
going, of course, to Cheder, a Hebrew school and my brother the same thing. And we
was going on a normal life. Of course, we had the little- the Lithuanians was not always
with Jews. There was stories all over the place, but we had a normal life and living like
normal people, and then, of course, in 1940 came the Russians because the war started
already with the Germans. It was not a war yet, but when the Germans came to Poland --
but the Russians came to Lithuania and then the Russians occupied Lithuania close to a
year, and then the war started in 1940.

Q: Tell me what changed when the Russians came.

A: It was a little different because you will -- I was going to a, to Hebrew school and then all
of a sudden I was going to a Jewish school. They are cutting down on the religious part.
They were trying to make all the children like sort like patriotic and, of course, when
you're young you think is the future. But my father was always against the regime
because of Communism. In fact, he got arrested one time. One time he got a chicken he
was carrying this to the street and he was stopped. What do you have a chicken for? And
he was afraid to tell everything to go to officially. They arrested him and after a couple
hours, but they let them out. They didn't want to get the men for the chicken. You can
imagine my father didn't care much for the Communists. But I was not myself. I liked the
movie and things like that. But it was really normal. It was a little different with the new
regime, but I was too young to see the difference.

Q: Let me ask you to go back before the Russians came. You said there was a lot of

Antisemitism?

A: There was because I can experience to start with, because I remember my father bought a
bicycle for my brother. I was the younger and he was a year older. We were riding one
time and I was saying, let me ride, let me ride, and all of sudden there was a few boys,
not Jewish, and one of them got a stick and put it right in the springs and he broke the
bicycle, and like young boys, of course, we chasing them. You broke the bicycle. How
come you broke the bicycle? And where I was living in -- we got a little farther out --
was a church and we chased them to the church and, of course, course the police came
out and let the two buys in and he put the foot in this door and he told us, go away you
Zyds. I told them and this time, of course, I spoke. I forgot —Lithuanian, I was going born
there-- them I told him he broke the bicycle and he kept saying, go away. Of course, I
couldn’t fight him. It was experience. We came back home and my father took this
bicycle to the man that fixed the bicycle and fixed it. But you had a feeling like you were
always not so welcome, like because I'm Jewish.

Q: Did you have Lithuanian friends?

A: Like I said, I was neighbors with a few of them, but in general I was in the Cheder. But in
the area I was living there was Jewish people. But we had a few people from the

a restaurant there. His son was a little friendly with us, and we were playing as
children, but didn't have too many Lithuanian friends.

Q: Did you hear about the Germans and the Nazis while the Russians were there?

A: Oh, of course, in 1933 when the Russians came into Poland. Of course, my father was a
middle-aged man and he talked about it with my mother, and he showed the papers a
little bit, in the Jewish papers and the Lithuanian papers what was going on in Poland, the
liquidations and the killing over there. And it was we started. A lot of Jewish run away
from Poland and come to Lithuania. In fact, when the army, the Polish army, fight the
Germans they came to Lithuanian because some of them didn't want to stay with the
Germans. But most of them was happy to have the Germans in Poland.

Q: You were very young. Did you hear your parents talking about it and did you read the
newspapers?

A: Yes. I couldn't understand a little bit and there was politic involved, and I could hear it
and feel it, and when I see in the, whatever, I saw in the paper I realized this that we are
not welcome. Something is going to come back and my father kept saying what was the
next step. He didn't realize that the Germans were going to attack the Russians this time,
but when the war started and they start feeling that the Germans are coming. But my
father reading the papers and knowing what is going on. It's time to leave everything and
run because what is going on in Poland is maybe going to be the same thing here in
Lithuania. And we had a horse and wagon, and I have a lot of stories to tell. We had a

small little horse and we are using it to take the coals from -- it was a little like a pony. It
was like a dog. You talk to him like a dog and this horse was doing things that were
believable. And my father had two horses but my father took the smaller horse and the
wagon and take the few things we can take with us, and we made the journey to run away
from the Lithuania. And the Germans were always bombing the airport, and a lot of Jews
start running to get away from the army.

Q: And this is in 1941?

A: This is in 1941. And only the same time these bombs was falling and, of course, the
Lithuanians were so happy to see the Germans coming, they're sabotaging the Russian
Army tanks, putting on fire and burning 6 the tire and shooting on them. And all of
sudden their own rifles and putting on the Lithuania uniform and really taking advantage
of the situation and start right away with the Jews, of course, but we didn't have enough
-- it was too fast. We left. They day they started throwing the bombs, my father took the
horse and wagon and we was going to get out of there. And we are running the streets
with the Russian Army and we were going to Latvia. A lot of people in this area. You can
go to Latvia and then to Minsk, and then from Minsk to White Russia, but we didn't make
the journey so far. We just took that horse and wagon. We have involved with the
Russian Army and then, of course, the Germans were bombing the streets and we were
going through the hole. I say the Holocaust, dead people right away from the first time,
and my mother, in fact, was shot, slit. The bomb cut in her leg we were running in this
way. We were going in the same direction as the Russian army. There was always fires
and dead people on the streets and a lot of them couldn't make it. You know, the soldiers
and a lot of people riding the horses didn't make it. We kept on going and then, of course,
we came to the border of Latvia. We came in at Minsk. There was a lot of Latvian people
there, but we hear right away from the Gentile people that something going on, terrible
things going on against the Jews, even in Minsk. But we were lucky and we were still
going in the car with the Russians, the army. But the army was really practically 99
percent in a chaos, didn't know what they are doing. One was running right and one was
running left, and then I remember one thing, that we were running, going with the wagon
and two Jewish guys came over and said you have to give us a ride. My father said, Look,
I got a little tiny horse. We have four people. We won't make it. They took out a revolver
and they point it at my father. They said, look, you are going to sit down and we are
going with you. Also because we can’t walk. They might look a little Communist
inclined, I don't know. Maybe they are soldiers, and then we are running like this. Not
running, driving and driving and driving and then, all of a sudden we had an attack with
machine guns and I felt -- I was in the wagon with my mother and my brother and my
father was driving the horse and the two men, and then all of a sudden we hear a
something. We hear a scream and one of them says, Oy, Oy. We look and then he laying,
fall back and a bullet went right in the man part, in this -- right in his, in the part, the men
part, and it went in this -- excuse the expression -- right in where it aches for the men. He
could feel the bullet. He could touch it. The other man said, don't do nothing. Drive
faster the horse. Drive the horse, and then we were already in Latvia, and then we

stopped and they are still with us two days, and then this man stopped some other people
and, of course, speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day, like a half a day and
they said we should go closer to the water. And they took him out of the wagon and they
said to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by
the water. And I said, how can you leave them by the water? And he said, I made
arrangements to the other side because the other side of the river, the Russian Army was
a little bit more organized. It could start to fight back. It made like a zone to fight back,
and we left them there. My father didn't want to leave the man. After all, he didn't know
him and now the man is wounded, and they kept on saying -- I was a boy and I could see
that it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and
my father said, don't do it. You'll kill him. And anyway we left him by the edge of the
water and we started going farther. We are already -- my father and my brother and my
mother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he
keep it on the wagon with him, and this he took with him. We are going there and then
nobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in Latvian, is different, similar but
different. My mother didn't speak Latvia, and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't.
Then he hear some from -- somebody told us that we are Jewish. You are one of
them. The Germans were not even there yet. We didn't know what was going on. And go
there, make a left and a right there. And there was a farm and there was a Jew. Maybe he
can give you directions. Anyway, we came over there. He had a farm and two sons and
all kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this. And there was a little
town and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very
nice man. And my father said to him, what should we do? And he said, I am in the same
boat like you are. The war was going on. We didn't know how long it was going to go. So
stay with us for a while. And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of
the farm was close to the water, maybe a quarter of a mile. And my father said to him,
maybe we could go over to the other side. But we couldn't. He wanted to go over. The
reason -- I skipped a little bit. The reason we came to this 10 place, he wanted to go to
Latvia. The Russian go over to Latvia. There was bridge and the Russian Army exploded
the bridge because -- then the tanks and the army. Their own people. There was a lot of
Jewish, and on the bridge, we were lucky not to make the time on the bridge. If we were
on the bridge we would be exploded too. Right before our eyes we saw the bridge
collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants,
really. With their rifles and they couldn't even walk. They got on the other side. We
remained on our side and the people on the other side, there was still the army holding
the gun. But a couple days on the farm with this man I said to my father, let me see what
was going on. And we took the little boat. We really wanted to go over. He said, I can't
take anyone right now. I was going in the nighttime. I was not there and my father, said
oh, my God, what is going on there? They are fighting with the Germans and
and the Jewish and he found out. And they couldn't make it back on the other side, but he
came back with this man from the farm. And he came back and said, look, he said, it is
bad. I am taking my horse and wagon and I am going. He had some people that came to
him and said, ride it out from the 11 people. And we are left completely alone, and this
was like in evening and I said to my father -- and my father's name was Heim(ph) -- and

he shake hands with him. I got my family and you have yours. I have to go my way. I
can't take you where I'm going. We go where we can and then, of course, we made the
journey to go back because we couldn't go to the other side. We were trying to go back
from where we came. That's why I said the little horse was like a dog. We didn't know
where to go and my father said to him, go horse. He didn't know where to go and he was
afraid to ask for directions, things like this. And luckily like I said in the beginning, my
father speaks Latvia, and we starting to move back in one little town and , the small
towns. And all of a sudden we hear from the people, the Gentile people, the Germans are
moving slowly. And then all of a sudden we see a German truck with soldiers and oh, my
father said, we are already under the Germans. We caught from the Germans. We are
going. My father was smart and took that horse and took some mud and smeared up the
horse and made the wagon look like farmers and look not like Jewish people, because he
hide the tallis that he had. We are going there and people are greeting us. People thought
we are going from one , from one little 12 town to another little town. We are
going back to where we go back to from there we went to . We saw where
we came to before we go with the Russians and we saw the bombs. We didn't
see the city. It was really wiped out. It was bombed. We didn't want to go but still some
buildings were still remaining there, and then all of a sudden we come in on the highways
where the German Army with this music with this big truck of ____ and tanks. And we
are five going farther than them. We are going farther and they are going backwards. And
they kept on saying in German , things like this. We knew how to speak
German too and, of course, my father knew we are all right. But of course, my father
knew more, but the Jewish and German is very similar. But in this experience we are
going down to a house, a bag to grab it and saw it on the ground and it exploded. It was
like a bomb. They didn't know if we are Jewish or not, but they didn't care. They were
soldiers but when we came in to this town -- and we are still in and someone
from the windows up from the top, what are you doing? Someone will recognize us. We
are not Latvia. There was a Russian man that said to my father, this Russian. It is now six
o'clock. Nobody is allowed to be on the street. Move off to 13 the side because they are
going to destroy you. My father understand stood Russian too and we moved over, right
where we could in the comer, and the night came and wagons and the machine guns and
the airplanes and the bomb. And German Army is so powerful, and this was in the
morning. We saw people start moving. We saw civilian people also. Then we start going
again with our horse. The journey to go back to Lithuania. And my father stopped and
asked an old lady. Why didn't you have the directions? Are you not from here? And he
said, no, to her. No, we're not from here, and she said oh, my God. Don't tell them that
you are Jewish they. Are killing all the Jews and killing all the Jews. It's in this
little town and this little town. And my father, of course, explained to us, he said to us, go
and don't ask nobody. If you are going to ask a question, where you are going, you will
not be. Keep on going. I can give you good directions and you go over the highways.
And we have to go where the army was. Don't ask for directions. My father didn't want to
ask for corrections, and he put in the tallis for good luck and they were driving by us. He
put in the tallis, you know, for good luck and driving by ourself. And all of sudden we
see soldier and already the Partisans 14 and the Latvia people, they put in their uniform

and they're running and the flowers they got for the Germans, and the womens get all
kind of and they -- and then Partisans with rifles and knives came over to us, first
with bicycle and come off the street because my father was making sort of like, sort of
like . You should be too much with the hiding because the army is going there.
They stopped us and they said to him, where are you going? to my father, and my father
said to him, oh, I know you. Because he spoke the language and they were drunk, really
drunk and bloody, full blood like , you know. My father said to him, I know your
father. Do you know? he said. He said, I have a little farm -- they were so drunk
they didn't know what was going on. And they asked my father, did you see any Jews?
Jews? I saw so many Jews not too far, half a kilometer. Full of Jews. People with a lot of
fences, sitting and telling a story. Oh, for this one, let's drink. In Lithuania, oh, this one
let's, drink and, you know, opened up a bottle of some vodka. And my father was
drinking and said to my brother and myself and to my mother, keep on moving, move,
move, and he said keep on moving, to my brother, who was a little older. And my brother
took the horse and started moving, and made 15 him to drink. And he drink a little bit. He
had to take a sip and he said to them, take them . Keep on moving. Move away
from the wagon we were maybe -- keep it moving so my brother was a little older and he
took the horse and he keeps moving. They made him to drink a little bit, a sip, what it
took, and he said to them, take them. My father says, keep moving with the wagon. We
were maybe two or three foot away from him and then my father start running to him and
he said oh, thank God. I get rid of them. Then we keep on going farther and we came into
a little town. It was called -- this was already before we came, we passed the border
because there were no border because the Germans already took over everything. They
opened up all the borders. It was not Latvia. No one was guiding there. We came into the
border there. Of course, we saw what was going on. We was scared. We saw dead people
right and left, right and left. Jewish people and the Russian people were laying,
slaughtered like so many pigs. First time I saw dead people and was the first time for me
and of course, you see dead people more and more and more. We came to a little town
called Milkinmeer(ph). It was not bombed. It was a nice little town. In fact, my uncle
came from there. 16 There was . There was a house full. We went riding for --
like I say, the horse was and my father didn't want to ask for directions, and we
came over there. We looked like farmers. He made it so we didn't, monotonous and tired
and things like this. We came into this little town and we came to a big house that was
maybe four are or five stories, and the Partisans were standing with rifles, and there were
only Jews. They put them all in this house and screams and one of them from the
window recognized when we went by, and someone screamed in, you are Jewish
move away, move away, and we looked up and , but luckily they didn't stop us.
We going farther. It took us another day and a half and two days before we came to the
Slobodka. Someone was arriving there. This was after the bombs because we came a
little later. It was raining in the streets and it was mostly red, like they killed animals. It
was from people. We didn't see too many because they pulled me away. And whatever. It
was really -- you could see blood in the streets instead of water. When we came
we came to our street. We were leaving. The horse was like a dog. This horse brought us
by the door. When we leaving there was a house. There was a house, four-story house

and there 17 was a gate like a door. You opened up and our house was in the back. The
back was nice. There was a garden. My father was renting. This man was a he
had a drug store. He built his house. It was a modern house and we lived in the back of
the house, and before he was living on the property, not ours but there was a garden and
took kind of some land and build a big house in front of this, in front the street, and we
came to this to go into the gates. It was locked up. We couldn't go in. My father tried to
open it up. It was locked. The people came to the window and we recognized they were
neighbors. Why did you come here? You know. My father said I just came from traveling
back from Latvia. How can you do this? Nobody's on the street. It's empty. Everybody is
dead. Somebody came down and let us in the gate they close it right up and
started telling us these stories. And all the neighbors, this street and this street. You could
see to the window our street. This particular area they didn't make it here, they don't
come here. They are still afraid they are going to come here. The house was empty. The
house was still there. Nobody touched the house and of course, we run back to the house
and the next we stayed overnight in our house. And all of sudden we hear 18
loudspeakers in this area and the streets were running full with Germans, you know,
because when we came in it was so quiet. And there was loudspeakers and this
where they are making the _ but my father was, of course, a little see what
was going on. See if my mother's brother was there. He run away and escaped. They went
to Russia. My father was going. I had my grandfather there and he was going to see his
mother and father but he was still there, safe in the . It was next day they killed all
the people in Latvia. You were safe from the it was next door they killed all the
people. My grandmother, they hide her under the bed and they didn't find her. It was a
little house, you know, they look and nobody was there. They didn't kill them this time
but they get them anyway. They had loudspeakers in the area. We could hear it. It was in
the area of the ghetto, but they took from all the Jews, and people start coming in the next
day. My father go downtown to find out and I go with him. And the horses was so tired
and couldn't go. We tried to give it a little bit water and it was walking. Was hard. Maybe
going to take the horse and go we drive about ten blocks still Slobodka. We saw the -- we
saw the little spitting on the Jew and doing -- all 19 the Germans, already the
soldiers. It was not organized yet . All of a sudden we saw this, these uniforms.
They are talking, the Gestapo and the Nazi, and so the people start coming from
downtown. In our area there was no gates or wire or nothing and my father was driving
and he wanted to see my grandfather. The problem we wanted to see if the uncle
was down in the city we. Drive for several blocks. We look where the used to
be. I had no window. They cut off the head from the robber and put it right in the
window, and my father see, and myself too and my brother was going with me too
because my mother was in the house and my father said, I'm not going. Father can see
what was going on and we went back to our home. It was not taking too long. It was
about three, four days. All of a sudden the Germans were the army against the Jews. They
pull everybody from all the towns and all over and and they come in with trucks
and big machines. And they bringing the wires and, you know, they came up with
loudspeakers, everything, everybody has to go out and help building the gates and the
wiring. And they went out and told them where to go. They got my brother and my father

but not me. Our house was about 500 foot away from the next street it was . 20
There was the fire. Already it was a street, a main highway. It was like a connection they
made. This was a big they made from the other side there was Jews too. They
made wires between two streets and they made the bricks over to go where we shouldn't
be. We have to build the ghetto ourself and then, of course, they get so organized. They
came in with, like I say, the Germans. The Germans alone didn't have a part in the
brutality because the and the Poles and the Latvia and have -- everybody was
helping the Germans to kill the Jews. Like I saying, they were killing already but
somehow we made it through the things. And of course, they putting everybody on the
wires in this area and then they say five kilometers or ten kilometers and couldn't see on
the map. I couldn't decipher it. Then they put in all the people from the sides and put the
gates, they told us it was going to be a couple weeks before the ghetto was created. But I
already had experience in Poland. Look like it. They, right away, they took the young
people for work and my uncle, rest in peace, he was one, the first one. And he was taken
right away from the ghetto, and the second they came in with trucks and wagons and
made a liquidation. Young children and old people. They have a special area where they
are 21 going to leave and, of course, they came in to my grandfather and grandmother
and they put them right away on the truck, and some other people. And in fact, I was
running to see my grandfather and when I get there, the Germans coming in and open up
the wires in this area. They didn't go around. They came in and closed up again. When I
see this area closing up with the rifle and the soldiers and the knives, then I turn back. I
was afraid because I knew not to go there because I was born there. There was a
Slobodka the Jewish people they were going to be . This was still in the
ghetto this time but I knew not to go away, to go through there. It was like a little
corridor between the two buildings. But when I say they closing the up the area with my
grandmother and grandfather, I didn't go back there luckily. If not, I would be catched by
them and not even here. Then they started taking out people. We didn't know where and
then, of course, they took them right away to Nitenfort(ph) and they killed them. I'm
talking this was tons of people. I couldn't give a number, and this was going on for a little
while. And right away the Germans came in with and the Jewish people to make
you going to there and you going to this, and they are started getting organized. I 22
would say three or four weeks this got already a , you know, Jews come
and they got people. They are putting the star of and they making people in
charge. You do this and you do this. And people from the other parts, Latvia and
never had enough food -- got involved in this, start taking out people already from the
ghetto right away from work. The people going to work on the airport or the they
call this. It was before the Russian, but the Germans took it over and they took people for
labor. And I myself was supposed to go too, but somehow I had a chance to stay back.
More and more we get tougher and tougher. Every day was they put the people in
our house and what we have? Kitchen and dining room and living room, a bedroom,
everything was in a long straight. If you go to the kitchen, you go to the dining room -- it
was a long house. I couldn't compare the house like they have here. It was a nice but in
this house we are living four people, but they put in 15 people. They put in people if my
whatever we had. This was already in the ghetto. Then they started taking out. By

this time the make the Auschwitz. They start taking out people they had more room to
release the prisoners. They came in and said there were too many people in your 23
house. It was going on like this for a little, a house we have plenty of room for them. It
was going for a little while like this and then we are going to work. And I point out this
thing that happened to me in the ghetto. In the beginning we had a cow and horse and
when the ghetto start, there was a sign right away. Everything you possess you have to
give it away. Of course, we had a horse andI had __I have the . L left them.
When I went when I left, when we were running away. The were still
there and I thought maybe ten or fifteen . There came a family from the ghetto.
They run away from friends. They used to get it was not kosher, whatever. It was
the -- they took the took the Germans you going to cook them and eat them. I said
I didn't know what to do with the __. They took the horse. We had to give the horse.
My father hide it in the place where the horse was staying, and a couple weeks these
loudspeakers come and everything you possess and everything you have from the living
thing, even a chicken, even a fork, everything that alive you were not allowed to have.
My father had to give the horse to the Germans. We get shot if they catch us with it. One
night I go with my father and there was a lot of places where 24 they had, farmer people
used to come rest, and then there was a few places like this. There was a police there, I
remember, when we had to take the police over there and there was German, the ghetto
and everybody had cows and animal and things. I will tell you about a cow. They left a
few cows in the ghetto for the milking. My father had to give up the horse. It was such a
kind horse. He used to eat from the your hand. He was like a dog really, not a horse. The
horse was so frightened that he start kick and had kicked up the German he almost kill
him. He almost knocked down the German. He grabbed the gun against the horse, you
know, and he grabbed the gun against my father and, did you tell him to do this? And my
father said, I can talk to the horse. He touched the horse and looked him in the mouth and
he said, this is a good horse. We ask to use it. Of course, they took it away and kick my
father as a thank you and kick him away because my father was going to . It was
on our street. This was the horse and when the ghetto start, they leave a few cows in the
ghetto for the . This was supposed to be. They were nice in the beginning. Then
one of the Jews -- the police came to our house and said you are going to feed the cow.
We take the cow from the house, from this house, 25 whatever -- was in the cows was
standing, pull the cows out, not to far to the s I went to the cow and he
run away and I was so hurt. I felt the cow was -- I was laying down underneath the cow
when a Partisan who looked at the cow and saw the milk is getting bigger, and he looked
underneath the cow and maybe thought I was going to drink or something, and it was a
little angry, the Partisan. The was not too far away and he shoot at me. The cow
got scared and the cow jumped away, kicked me. I started running into the ghetto and I
was chasing the cow, and the cow run until I grabbed the cow and pulled her and back
put it back where the cow belonged. It was the the first few days. It was then,
when the ghetto was going. On I went a few times to work. You also go to work and then
they block the ghetto altogether, and they -- and they made a big action. And this is the
thing, that thing make this was a small ghetto from a big ghetto, and they -- I
think they, before they got liquidated we had experience with what they are doing. I will

tell you about this too, then I will tell you about the action. When they liquidated they
took most of the people from the small ghetto and taking them to the Nitenfort(ph) taking
them to the Nitenfort(ph), but before they did it 26 there was a hospital in this small
ghetto. It was run by Jewish doctor and all kind of people that were capable to run a
hospital. It was a regular hospital before. When our house was not too far away from the
gates where they make, and then across the street there was a another ghetto and you can
see in the back of our house a few blocks away, not in blocks. There was a then.
Over there was you can see they built a study for Jewish learning and farther away from
the hospital I -- like I say, our house was not so tall but the house in front was four or five
stories. They closed up the small ghetto altogether. The military and the soldiers and the
Germans and the Partisans were there. When I went up in the roof -- I was young when
we were living -- there was a little window to look out. I saw what was going on. They
were kicking people and punching them around and putting them in the sections. And
when I say from far away, I saw them coming around the fire, and two or five wagons
around the building, and then the Germans. And they put a store on the building. They
take the kerosene and gasoline and they put this building on fire, and they are jumping,
live people. I'm sure four, five hundred people in the building, maybe more. When they
bring down the hospital, they were laughing. 27 I could see. I was not far away. When
people try to run to the window, they were shooting them. They were falling like a bag,
like nothing. We saw this was going on and this was the small hospital. That's the way
they liquidated the hospital. Then the big action came from the big ghetto and then, of
course, they run around with the loudspeakers. And this time was already the ghetto
organized. It was the Jew Police. In fact, my uncle -- he was not a plain person but he
looked like a bit, looked German. Here a room for you, going to watch this street. You
can watch the street. It should be quiet. People shouldn't stay in groups and talk. He was a
quiet man, but thanks to him this life too, in concentration camp. But the way it
looked like because of him we went on the good side and my aunt went to the other side.
And when they make the big action, they came out with loudspeakers and start saying
everybody have to meet in this certain place. It was an empty place in the ghetto. They
stage things like this. It was empty, where people used to play football. This was thought
nothing but there was no . There was woods and cemetery not too far away, and
they put all the people, everybody young and old and not sick, everybody have to be
there. And they took out from 28 their houses, carry them out from the beds and, of
course, they came back to the houses looked like the people were. There was thousand
and thousand of people and they make a selection and they make people -- panicking
people. Can't take nothing with you. When people get lost from each other, you can hear
them saying mama, papa , you know, the Jewish name. There was a panic and this
was early in the morning. It was maybe five o'clock in the morning the day before. It was
not light outside. You have to go to this truck. We came to this place where it was
standing, couple trucks for the Germans and the Partisans, and there was the Germans
standing with the little stick. And everybody have to got to face him, and you right, left,
right, left, and the Jewish Police have to take the group, 30 or 40 people, up to this man.
There was a few of them and it looked like my uncle, and he run over to us, because he
was this time a little room for us and he said follow me, beginning with me, and

somehow he thought maybe he could make a move or something. The Germans
said we should go to the right side or the left side, I don't know, but we followed my
uncle and we went to the right side. We saw the people go to the left. They are treating
them more awful then they are 29 treating us. On the right side we saw -- it was looser,
the ghetto, more and the left was closer the other side. And he separate into thousand and
thousand of people, and they open up the gates and put the people back in the clean
ghetto, back where they burned the hospital. It was still there and they moved them in
there. And it was deep in the night and everything starts falling to quiet, and they came to
the right side and they said you can go if you have the houses where you live. Go back to
your homes and we are still in the ghetto and they was pulling on the people in the left
side, and stopping the soldiers, the Partisans. And like I say, the Lithuanians
were maybe with the Germans and they put them in the other side, and we went
back. Of course, in the panic and we missing -- my father is not here with my mother, and
my father and my brother were lucky this time and we were pulled back to our home.
And like I say, we are not too far away from the smaller ghetto and other people going to
houses here. The whole night screaming and panicking and so like in the morning, they
opened up in the morning and they put them all in the line and put them in the Nitenfort.
There was house, I don't know the number, but it was, you couldn't see from one end to
the 30 other, there was so many people. This was small babies and they did
everything. This was a big action, they call it. It was big the action.

Q: Did you know where they were going?

A: We knew because, because we knew earlier because they killed our grandfather the
Nitenfort and you were going out to work and this faction -- so telling us what happened
to us. I didn't see good people. There was maybe a few. I didn't see a good German where
I was, but I won't go into it, and they took these people and start them marching them to
the Nitenfort, and we were still remaining in the ghetto. This was our luck, and in the
morning the ghetto was completely empty, the small ghetto, and we could hear in the
night the machine guns and the shooting, because the Nitenfort was not really far away
from the ghetto. It was just really a couple kilometer up the hill. And sometimes playing,
sometimes there I didn't know what was going to happen there, and you could see from
the Nitenfort and see Slobodka. It was not so far away. And we could hear the shooting
going on and the killing and, of course, nobody came back from there. And sometime we
knew what was going on even before they are taking people in the Germany and the
Austria and marching them between the two lines, two ghettos. 31 They were killing
them over there too, and where were we going. We knew already. This night you don't
tell people that they are going be killed. You couldn't make any move. If anybody move,
your would lose you're life. And now I was walking down, and I liked to carve. Now, I
was walking down, but I always like too carve and make airplanes and things like this.
One day in the ghetto time, I was already working on the airport and we were digging
ditches and doing some other thing. They had a lot of prisoners. The Russians treat them
terrible. Germans, they so do the prisoners was to us was you were
Jews. It was coming to us. That was the way they thought. But even to the Russian

military they lost a little bit of faith, are we going to be alive. It was going on and when
ditches -- going back to the ghetto -- I was not going to work. I was sitting outside and I
was carving a little airplane and all of a sudden the Germans came in. They were free to
go in their Jeeps and the Germans stopped. Four Germans walked to me and said to me

what are you doing there? I am playing. I am making myself a toy. How do you

know to make an airplane? You know, to me and I spoke, I think little and I spoke
German in a way too because it was similar, so I told him I always 32 like to play. Do
you have more knives? And I said, no, I have this one. No, I have this knife. And he said,
you go to the Jeep, and I said, I want to tell my mother. And he kicked me and put me in
the Jeep and I thought they were going to kill me, kill me. Downtown in the there
isa school. People used to learn there. This was the headquarters for the
Germans they put me in a basement and said to me, we aren't going to do nothing to you.
We want you to make airplanes for us. I didn't know what they wanted from me. I said,
can you tell my parents? One of them okay, I'll tell them. My mother and father
thought I was dead. Because my mother and father thought I was dead. They took me out
and -- this was going on all the time. I was there maybe a couple of days. I don't know
whether it was night or day because it was dark there, but it was light inside. And they
bring me all kinds of tools and I made toys. I made a butterfly and an airplane and they
keep on saying, keep on doing, keep on doing. I was a couple days and they took from
everybody. I had a imagination and I always like to look at the airplanes, and when I was
younger I dreamed of becoming pilot. Can you imagine me a pilot? But I had a dream.
Who knows, if the war wouldn't be there 33 or something. And I was doing these
airplanes for them and I took maybe four or five models. They gave me soft wood.

I never worked with this. I tried to get out here and I even so I was doing. A few
days went by and they came and said, oh, come on, you know, in German. I think they
going to shoot me or something. They take me back to the same German that picked me
up and, you know, drop me off at the gate and said go, go. They opened up the
gate and it was also the Jewish Police guard, and what happened to you? They took me
there and I was making the airplanes. I went in by foot not too far away from the grates
where you go in into main gates to go in when you get out from the ghetto. Of
course, my mother and my father was working there and they thought I was dead. And
then life still was going the same system like it was and the next day I had to go to work.
When there in the ghetto a certain time, not all the time in the ghetto, and then all of
sudden somebody came to the building. Back of the building had to be open. Didn't have
to be closed anymore. Now, the place where we were living, the house was a lot of sacks.
My father had the horses there. It was a big area and we wait for the ghetto, to wait for
the ghetto. To come there was a beautiful wood and the 34 trees and this area, it was like
a place that you can unload some wood and coals there was not room. We did this for a
little while. There was a garden. We cleaned up the garden made enough place
to put in the roots, and they brought the horses, and they came from the street and they
was killing them in the sacks. This was the meat for us to eat in the ghetto.

A: The horses were wounded from the war, but also not enough. They used to
bring them there, not far away from our horses.

Q: You used to stay in this sack?

A: Call it a sack.

Q: A sack?

A: A place where you have like a garage. It was not a garage. There was four of them like
this and they used to bring the horses there, and they would bring the people from the
ghetto and kill the horses and slaughter them and put them in the other place and cut it
apart and give it to the -- there was meat and some of the horses I'm sure were sick. Some
of those horses couldn't even make it. They brought them in the ghetto and give it to the
Jewish people, and here's. Do what you want with it. But one day we 35 hear a knock on
the door. It was early in the morning they came in with the Jewish Police and a German.
You're family is chosen to be, to go to work. You are going to be in the ghetto and we are
going to send you to the . They call it in a place where the castle is, and we
thought they were going -- can take nothing with us. Whatever we had possessions. Of
course, we had some stuff in there, in the ghetto that was going on. We had a farming
coat and we used to go by the wire and they would come back on business, and I didn't
want to keep it. Before I left the ghetto -- it was before the action -- and I remember my
father got a coat for my mother. It was a beautiful coat like a mink coat, and they walked
over to the gates and there were the dying people and she said, what can I get for it? I
have a kilo of butter and things like this, and over the gate and the Partisans were
guarding us. They looked away and they were making stuff like business, and take
everything away that they could. And I remember my father was quarter pound
of butter or meat for the coat. And other people sold beautiful things. A dead cat, you
know. You know, what was in the bag. A lot of people making dogs, or something

one put in a poison. The things that were coming over, you don't know what 36
you got in this. My father was lucky. He got a piece of meat because maybe it was
poisoned and we tested. We needed it. We tested and it was butter. And then they took
us. Like I say, we came back. I don't want to skip this little story the way they are treating
us there.

Q: Before you go to the castle, I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions before you get
to the castle. What were you doing for food?

A: We were given food, bringing into the ghetto. There was a certain place you could go in
and pick it up. There was not food, but everybody made a little garden and some people
used to go to work and bring food in the ghetto. It was going on like a business.

Q: As a child did you feel hungry all the time?

A: In fact, my mother had a piece of bread and I said to my mother I was hungry, but my
brother was hungry and I said, can I have a piece of bread, and she didn't keep it for
herself. She keep it for us and I said to my brother, and she said my brother was hungry
and gave me a little piece and she didn't take it. We were always hungry. And then they
took us from the ghetto out from our house.

Tape #2

Q: Now, let's go back and talk about you as a boy in the ghetto. Let's talk about food. Were
you hungry a lot?

A: We were hungry all the time. There was not much to eat and like I said, they gave away
all other possessions that they had. They go to the gates and for food -- and but in
the ghetto someone was going out to work who somehow, some people were making was
make like a black market. Some of other people from taking out whatever they can for us.
Some food in the ghetto was not enough, but it was not . When I was in the
ghetto, when I was in the ghetto for a long time right after the big action I didn't have too
much. When I was in the ghetto, I couldn't remember the month, three quarters of year,
and they took us to the castle like I say.

Q: What about other children? Did you play with other children?

A: Yes. In the ghetto I had friends, started a stamp collection. I still have some. We had a
little time. Some of them came from other areas. They didn't have a home, have clothes. I
was still in my house. I had collections of stamps and some pictures of other guys, and
across the street I was living there was a place. This used to be a store like a supermarket
and it was 38 very wealthy person, and there was a big yard and people used to come in
there and people stop in horses and wagons, not cars. We were more on the farm side,
you know. We used to stay over there and buy some food and things like this. They had
two sons and we were friends and, in fact, the same age. One was the same age as I am
and one was my brother's age and my father was and we were going up together.
This was before the war. I want to point this out because this was at ghetto and then they
left and I will tell you what happened. This was before the children used to come to our
house and my mother used to make for dinner, and the children used to come eat with us
because the reason why, because they had leftovers. The apple, the pear and normal
country food was not this time. They used to come and eat the leftovers and my mother
said we always cooking for them, and in the ghetto they were taken away. I didn't see
them. I saw them for a little while in the ghetto. We couldn't go, you know, across the
street and find out where are you. They went somewhere else to work. I saw them right
before the action. After the big action, I didn't see them. I didn't see the whole family. I
didn't know what happened to them. They were either taken -- I will tell you, we met his
39 father in the concentration camp. We didn't know what happened to them. Houses
were taken away from people. There was people were sleeping there. There was no store
anymore but this was in the ghetto time and I didn't know what happened to them until
we came in the concentration camp until -- I remember them?

Q: Do you remember the games people children play. I know you had your stamps.

A: People children used to play -- jumping on one foot and making -- I was already bigger
by this time and the ghetto was around 12 to 13 years and -- you don't jump on one foot --

and Hitler was not in this because we were looking for survival, and he asked me if I was
afraid for my life. There was not a day I was not afraid for my life. I came back to the and
beginning. Like I mentioned in the beginning, in our house came a family from France,
and they were eating the rabbits. But there was a boy. He was very intelligent, young
man, my age, and they are burning our place and we were leaving. Like I say they
burning some wood for the ghetto to bring, you know, to burn for the, for the office and
things like this. They also used to bring boxes from the military for wood for kindling
lighting. In the boxes they had a lot of screws and nails and things like this, and this boy
was also 40 going to work. It was Sunday and I didn't go to work and this boy said, I
have a trick to make and, I said, fine. He said, let's take two of the bulbs and take two
screws put them together and put inside some and you see it will like explode.
This was in the ghetto time. We are going back to the ghetto. He also handy and he told
me -- I was doing it and I took it, the knot and put a screw in one side, a metal screw and
filled up the knot with heavy powder and filled it with powder put another screw in the
other side, and took a rope from side and tied it up and swung it and knocked it against
the wall. And in our backyard -- and there was in our backyard was a building for bricks,
you know, for the , you know, where you put the garbage cans and cans with
emptying. We had just drop it in and sort it out. It was made out of brick. When I was
swinging this string with this wire knot it exploded, but it gave such a shot that
we were not too far away from the gate and from the and the Germans were
guarding. And like I say, they were on the other side and from nowheres we get such a
shot and the smoke came out and I didn't know what happened to me. And there was
completely exploded and the knot was going, and I see the wire in my hand, and it took
me three 41 seconds, five seconds, ten seconds. Missiles were coming from out of the
other side from the ghetto, and they cut the wire and came in right away from the army. I
don't know where they came and they surrounded the whole area and said who shot? And
what happened, this piece of wire, this piece of metal fly so far and hit one the soldiers in
the helmet. And I didn't know what happened. And they said who shot all they
came in to our place where we were living and took everybody out the houses. And those
people are going to work some. Took my mother my father, everybody, who shot? And I
was the one who did it. And I spoke German and I was getting better in German. I was
getting better, got used the to the , you know, it seemed like the Jews were getting
close to German. I had to, when this shot was going, to kill us and I raised my hand and I
said, I did it with this little French boy and somehow, you know, I spoke to him
and one the Germans said -- and they were also Partisans there -- and they took us and
put us with this man, and was almost big, big, man for the German and said,
where is the gun? We said, we don't have a gun he said -- we are praying -- he
said, how are you doing it? I had to demonstrate and, of course, when he saw what I'm
going 42 to demonstrate, and he told the whole 50 or 60 soldiers and rifles, and one of
them with the knife out and sent them back out to go on. And there are new soldiers and I
have to demonstrate, and it didn't work I tried to bang it and bang it and, the German
said, I'm going to show you. And he took it in the hand and knocked it and
almost knocked it off his hand and burned him. He had gloves and he said, I see how you
did it. He was really embarrassed to things like this. He didn't realize it was going to

explode but this guy from France, I know his father told them, I don't know how
he came in to idea and, of course, he realized that this was no or whatever, then
realized, and he felt a little bit bad and knocked it with a stone and made with a stone.
And it made him a little bit more guilty, and somehow he could kill us like nothing and
only flying and you know, he had the power. He didn't have the chance
of playing in the ghetto. This was my play and I didn't have much time to play because
we had to go to work.

Q: What were you doing?

A: I worked in the airport. They were putting in some stones and loading and unloading
trucks for the Germans, and some of them were load it out and put it 43 in the airplanes
and . There was an airplane, you know, it was a big it up and I was
working. They gave us also -- you always to do something in the ghetto. I was there. I
used to -- people made gardens and they used to take us to pull out the carrots and potatos
and dig it up and plant a little around. Some backyards had a lot and belong not to the
people, but belong to the people in the committee, and they used to give it out to the
people. This was my work.

Q: Were there other young boys your age? You were about 13?

A: My brother was there and my brother was also involved same like me, but he was
somehow going more to work like I did. I used to go three times a week and he had to go
five times a week. He was a little older, and sometimes my father said go and he can stay.
You didn't have a choice what to do. But somehow I stayed behind in the ghetto. I had to
do something. I had to go to the and things like this. My brother was older by this
time and he got so survived.

Q: What do you remember about the Jewish Police?

A: I didn't see because when I was in the ghetto was in the beginning, you know. Some of
them is good 44 people. Everywhere some of them was showing a good face for the
Germans and Lithuanian soldiers and pushing around and kicking around. Some of them
have to do it and some of them, you know, were nice. And so long as they have
something to do. I didn't see too much bad from the police because like I say, I was at the
end of it. Some of them were bad. I remember from the concentration camp, a couple, but
there was also the Germans, Jewish men, and who was not but I didn't have too
much connection with the Jewish Police.

Q: Your family knew Dr. Elkus(ph).

A: My father knew him from in the army and Lithuanian and had he knew Dr. Elkuis
personally, and maybe he got is or something. He was a very famous
doctor, and in the camps he was doing something for my father. He operated on his foot.

Q: Do you remember him from the ghetto or not?

A: I remember Dr. Elkus -- he was a big man, he was doing his job. He was
organizing people to go to work and things like this. He was on the committee as much as
I can remember, but my father remembered him from the young years when we were
free. Then of course, when in the concentration camp with him.

Q: Was there any schooling at all? Was there anybody 45 teaching?

A: Yes. They called , you know, there was schools in the ghetto where they were
teaching not just for our benefit but for their benefit. There was electrician school and
there was a school for mechanical things.

Q: The Germans set it up?

A: In the ghetto the Jews set it up and the Germans support it, but I didn't have a chance to
go to this place because I was deported to the this other place. The castle they call this.

Q: Do you remember when you were deported to this castle?

A: It was in the beginning of summer, like I say, in May or April like this.

Q: In '41, no? It was '42. Like I say, I was half wartime in the castle then. I was in the ghetto,
but I came to the ghetto a few times. I will tell you this time. After I was in the ghetto I
was in the castle -- of course, they took us. I want to come back to this. They took us out
from the house they brought us like a jail that was there, the was the name of it,
the . I don't know what it was. There were people they are not being
nice in the ghetto. 46 Some people have a little whiskey or something, or some of the
Germans put them in for punishment. And this was in the ghetto. They put us in maybe
with about ten families and they get from other places and they put us in, stay here. We
thought they were going to kill us. We asked the Jewish Police what are they going to do
with us? We couldn't take nothing for our house, nothing. He came in and he said, look, I
am going to work. I will . We are going to the . My father knew the area.
There was a castle. There was a castle. This was from the president or the king of
Lithuania, and they took us there. We have to go by foot. It was about 15 or some
kilometer. We were marching there. We didn't know where we were going. They came
in. They walked out from the ghetto. We saw the ghetto farther and father away. We are
going with guard of course. It was maybe a 100 families and there was young people.
There was not too many girls. Most of them were boys and the girls, of course, were also
in the ghetto. But I saw girls before the war but but was girls -- but I was not --
didn't see too many girls in the area where I was. And they took us by foot to this castle
and we came there, and there was a box built, a little house like. It was before they
looked 47 before, and we sat. And there was wires around. It was like a ghetto

but it was a little ten blocks. It was a place and there was a purpose for water outside, and
there was not too much. And there was what I call a garage, like a sack and there was a
place to keep the food and there was no place to play football there. It was very together.
And a little farther you look out from the other side, you could see the . It was
the castle and not too far away, and you go in this one and you go in this one. Luckily, it
was still my father and my mother and my brother. We were lucky there. It was lucky
I would say I was the lucky one to be with the family together, in this particular
area and they took us the right next day and a was the man in charge and I
remember he had this family too. I forgot his wife and in this group was only one small
child. They hide it in the ghetto and -- I don't know how they brought him in, hiding in a
box or something -- made him to come in. This little boy was around five years old.
There was no way for five year old to survive. But in the ghetto was a few people before
they made the they called us. They take all the children on the force and they had
some small children in the ghetto, hiding and things like this, and in this 48 castle
there was most of the people were my age, a little older, who, of course, the people like
my mother and my father. And there was a families. Not families, a few. There were
some families, lost their family already in the big action. I was really -- not all the people
-- I was really this family was holding together. The rest was already torn apart.
And they made us to go to work there. We go there and I was working in the castle and
there , and we making the rooms, rooms making ride around with horse
and build a school and put in . We were always doing this type of work, but there
was a German almost it was a big man. A little bit less . He was the man
in charge to make sure the people should go to work. That was his duty. But this man
also had barber used to cut the hair for the soldiers. He was he was was
not he was cutting the hair for the soldiers and then he and he choose me
to take this like this. I should make sure and I be the first one back, and soap to
be clean and I was back, make sure everybody got a soap to be clean or this get a
and I was in charge, like to give out the . Ina way I was very obeying
orders. What did you want me to do? He was like a 49 German, like any German. But we
didn't feel the presence because we were away from the ghetto. I to do this and I was to
take other work. I was walking over to . He was a sculptor and he was make a
face for Hitler and I have to assist him, but before I came to this in this camp and in this
castle, I was doing, I was doing all kind of work. And my mother was going out with the
womens to cut woods. They are cutting go down trees. The men were doing and a little
bit other works, cement and things like this. In there in this castle they were building it so
fast. They could do things overnight. They building a school and brought the -- this
brought in over there for Hitler to -- they brought in from France the a lot of
people young people my age, and we were a little bit younger, and little bit older. The
older boys were going to gentile they had to have duty. They learn to be a soldier too.
They have the right to have a rifle. There was a little called him. He was kind and
he was guarding me sometime and guarding everybody, but one day I saw him. I was
going out with my mother this time in the field to cut the trees, and this time I was going

beat my mother. And I was not far away and I was running to him but other people were
holding me. Father was not there and they were holding me back not to go, and hit my
mother. And I remember this and this one was on duty. He was two days with the rifle
and two days, I was working there in this castle for bring water, was water was
there is not water. You had to go to the water and bring it to the kitchen for the soldiers. I
was walking and I overhear you look like you're handy. You're going to help me
out there. I was not there three months and there was a sculptor and he was making a face
for Hitler, and I was talking to him he was a because I was going on what's going
on? But everybody -- there was not one person in the German Army. Biggest one, he was
very intelligent man and he made a face of Hitler, this the sculptor and I was supplying
him with the clay, making the clay make forms. When day when I remember this boy was
hitting on my mother and beating up my mother, and this was area in the area and
sometimes we had to go out and fill up a bucket of water, and I say one day he
came in for duty and he was on the second floor -- no top floor -- where he was putting a
sculptor 51 and he said to me go down -- in German -- bring me some
water and they show this fresh water coming in well. There was a kitchen
downstair and there was a smaller building, and there was a cook and there was a bunch
of prostitutes, and there was and they were working for the Germans. And they
were having a good time with the soldier and this was all going on over there. When I go
down, he told me to go down with the bottle and I took the bottle with me and I
and he bring the bottle over to -- and nobody's there. And he is downstairs in the kitchen
there and I took the bottle and opened up the nozzle and washed the bottle nice. I didn't
know if the German was watching me or not. I filled up the bottle and I closed it up and I
close it up and I taste it. I was thirsty and honestly, I was dropping it. I was afraid to spill
it on the ground. I was dripping a little in my mouth and I felt a push and, you know, and
my mouth went right in the nozzle. And I opened my eyes and I see this beat up
my mother. He didn't have a rifle. He took a stick and was trying to make like the horse
going faster -- I don't know how you say it in English -- the took the and he start
whipping me, you know, because when he pushed me I fell. I went up against him. I
thought it cut 52 my throat, whatever. He took this stick and he was smashing me and
beating me up, and the girls, don't hit him, girls from the beat him, give him and
everyone on his side, of course, and I had been very thirsty and, you know, the bottle I
had for the and he standing on the bucket -- and I don't know. He beat me so fast I
couldn't take it. I pulled the rope and I kicked him. When I kicked him -- and this was the
basement and he fall. He lost his grip and he fell in the basement. And soon as I did this,
of course -- he was also a soldier. He run out. All the girls and a couple soldiers right
away, and one of the them put a rifle. And they were German too. A little drunk and
having a good time with the girls. They were going to shoot me. They were going to
shoot me. It was a miracle at the time this was going on, one of Germans said, you know
what you do? You pushed a German. And they were going to shoot me. There was no
way to survive but he looked like -- he told me later -- there it is not to too far
away and he said to them in German, what is going on here? And I told him. I was
bleeding from my mouth a little bit and I told him I was cleaning the bottle and he said,
don't tell me. I saw everything. He saw what was going on. He saw that I didn't

drink from this 53 bottle. He said, I saw. I was laying down and dripping it from the
bottle dry, in into my mouth and, of course, he was such a big man. All of them were --
with the revolver to my head, he was afraid to say a word against him. , you
know, let the boy go. He was walking with me and it's not his fault, it's his fault, he
started up with him. That's what he said. I took the bottle and went up with him, and I
took the bottle and went up with him and he told me if I needed -- he didn't give me any
water. Are you okay? I okay. I felt like I should say, but I didn't. There was water like I
take for the clay, not for me to drink because there was no glass. I . There was
water that I used for the clay. It was clear water from the well for the clay -- and take
another clean water. No drinking water but this was clean water from the well. We had
other water also but it was not drinking, for drinking. But I think I remember I took a
little bit to the water and washed my face and then I walked with him over there for a
little while, and then he was deported, you know, they took him away somewhere. To go
I was walking again and with these people and they walk in the woods, and they
saw this whole thing until this was going on. But in same time I was going out my 54
tooth was hurting me, and the men said to me in the ghetto, they have a tooth doctor, A
dentis, you know, they had in the ghetto they had everything. They said we have to go
bring some food for the camp. We are going to take you and your father this time and we
will take you to the dentist and see what they can do. He was a nice man. I went with my
father and we are there in the area and we came into the ghetto. I went -- I came into the
ghetto. They didn't let us in the ghetto. But the gates not too far away, wagon with a little
truck which belonged to the German and good for they -- and this camp and this was for
this one and there wasn't and we had to load it on. I wanted to go to the dentist,
you know, but somehow the police, they said to my father, don't go in the ghetto because
there is going to be a . There is going to be a selection and taking out all the
children. Because when they closed up the gates nobody can go in the ghetto, nobody can
come out of the ghetto and the policeman told us we supposed to go out to the castle but
we couldn't go out. But luckily, I don't know, somehow it must have been the telephone
and things like this, they delayed us for about an hour. And all of sudden they came and
they the trucks were full and they made the selection. 55 They went in every house over
there and they went deep in the ghetto, and I was right by the gates. I was on the other
side of the gates, not where I was in the beginning. They were making the selection
already. Already they killed people. They -- whatever they could grab. They grabbed the
girl and raped her and they cry. Of course, I didn't see it but other people told us, and I
know from other people what was going on. And luckily, they had to let us out of the
gate because they needed food for this place. He was driving the horse and you couldn't
going by German. He was in camp where I was there and we went out and was the
are you going on the selection in the ghetto. We came back to this. We were not
too far from home. It was about a half hour, hour, not too far away from this place, and
we came home and told them what was going on. Selection again. Only for children.
They took children, older people, whatever. They couldn't -- they cleared it up. But the
next day this I got a note from, you know, the telephone call. The German on the
telephone. They are going to check it out in our camp too. There was maybe me, my
brother and a few other boys, but then and there was a little boy five years old, and

this five-year-old boy had a brother my age. So 56 like I say, and the mother was there.
The whole family was like sticking together. This this man that was in charge,
he came out. He said, look, I know you have a small son. There you just make
yourself tall. I remember. I was a tall boy and I would survive. I will tell them you were
important. He has a job he was doing. The -- he had a list of what they are doing. They
came in a Jeep, a military car, but Gestapo, the SS, everybody, had to take the barracks.
The little boy was in the same barrack where -- he was sleeping. They took the little boy
and put him on the like they used to do this too. And a German officer or
somebody from the army or the ghetto, he looked at. He walked in and look at the little
stick and I stood up straight and said you know, look, muscles, like a dog, you
know. Then I said , you know, small children here. The little one opened up his
mouth and said to him -- I never forget this -- he said to him, no, there is no small
children. All the children are sleeping, sleeping but he was looked like a German.
I'm sure but somehow they in German but somehow made him so he said,
you know, to the little one, he didn't do nothing to him. And they walked out and
for now they did nothing. We thought 57 already this a miracle happening, but I think it
was in it was the next day or the same day came out a car with different
Germans. They arrested the little boy and the man -- you take out a rifle to him big, little
for the camp, on the in and the mouth, where is the little boy? He couldn't run out
of the place and he couldn't run out from the place. There was all the soldiers. They
pulled away this little boy from the -- and the Germans in the _, like a dog. I'm
talking about my horse. And like an animal and this little, mommy, mommy. You could
see it. You see sometimes in the films. I saw it with my own eyes. She passed out, the
mother because the father was at work, you know ready to go, ready to go. I
think it was the money. They took him away and that's it. This was the experience in this
camp. We were walking there. There are so many stories to tell about this. It was not
. I was beaten up a little bit too. And then the time came and we found out the
Russians are coming closer to the area. You have to be liquidated. And they said to us,
this work will stop. And I have a story. Was going there with the time for this.
We stop this walk. Now, we said -- now, we're going to take you back to the ghetto and
this is going to be no more job for you. 58 We got to the ghetto. That's it. They going to
lull us. It was a few days. They gave us a warning. We didn't have possessions. Just
clothes, a few things, nothing to take with us. And they said I don't know where
-- the German in charge look, I don't know. Where we going? We go to the ghetto. We
are going like lambs. We couldn't fight because everybody was against you. If you go out
to the line, they shoot you. If you go out to ask help for a little, they give you out. You
have to go like a lamb. There was no way to give resistance and they took us back like
foot, and the same way we came there and it was, of course, a year later they took us.
Q: You were in the castle for a year you think?
A: I was -- would say it was close to a year. I was in the ghetto until the big action.
Q: How was the health of your mother and your father?

A: Luckily, it was not so bad. Of course, we had aches and pains. Who cares? You know,
you want to survive. You couldn't complain. Now I complain all the time, sometimes to
the doctor, but you couldn't do this. But at this time my father was younger than me than
Iam now. In the 40 and 50, like this. Somehow he was -- he wanted to be alive, to
survive. You gets along even if you have some health. You talk yourself 59 into this that
it don't hurt.

Q: What sort of food did you have in this castle?

A: Not bad, because we were we organized food. The woman could cook a little bit in
this barracks. It was not bad. It was like the same way in the ghetto. But we had enough
food. I remember before I go farther -- I am stopping all the time. I remember there was a
time when they found a man wandering outside. They stopped him and they put him in
the camp where we are. They pull down the pant and he is circumcised. We got a Jew.
They beat him up to death. They beat him so he couldn't talk. He was a little bit crazy,
and they called in and said they are going to kill him. All of is sudden a Kapo came

this was their son. He was not Jewish. They came to the German and had pictures
too. They had a they show it was not a Jew. It was not Jew because this is how
they treat us, you know. He was a little bit mentally. He run away from the house. They
told him he was circumcised because he was sick or something. And they almost killed
him but ambulance came to take him out. This was the way. No respect for the Jews.
Anyway, going back they tell us we have to leave -- ?

Q: Let me ask you another question: How did you 60 sleep?

A: In this particular place there was old mattress, smelling and things like that. A little boy
was hiding under. The mattress was straw. We had a roof. We went through the cold
weather and it was really not comfortable, to say it was livable, but we managed
it.

Q: Did you have nightmares?

A: Always get scared to see what was going on, everyone there, people were dying. In our
camp sometimes they couldn't make it or beaten up. It is not so paradise in this place
either, but still was better than in the concentration camp, and we had nightmares. I still
have nightmares. I still remember things. Sometimes I watch a movie and I think I am
living there. This is -- I saw Schindler's List. It's nothing. It's much worser. I didn't see a
good German. I will tell you a little farther if I have the time. They put us -- and have to
go back to the ghetto -- and they march us back to the ghetto. And like I said, it was on
the left side of the -- and the ghetto was on the right and the gates were now moved
around. Not the wire. It was original, but they moved it closer to move to the exit like
you go to it was right in a fork. We are going there 61 and praying to
God not to go to the left side, because the left side going to Nitenfort. Then they move us

to start to go to the right and they move to the right, and certain three, four lines away
from the front and I said to my mother get in the back because, you know, you
find out you are going to the right side, and then we walk in the ghetto. Soon as we get in
the ghetto we are nowhere right away. The police, the Kapos said you have to go
to the right. In here and stay there. Don't move until you get orders. We don't know where
to go, what to do, but my father had two, cousins in the ghetto and we didn't know. We
came back. We were sitting there, waiting for order and all of sudden I think was
maybe the police. He is of not policeman. He said you met my father and he said
where are you? I'm staying in the barrack. You want to go. Maybe you should come to
us. You want to go to them. We didn't know what to do. they have coming in and
surrounding the ghetto with machine guns. The whole army was there with loudspeakers.
People are going to be liquidated to Germany for work it was most of them
working for.

Q: They're announcing this?

A: Yes. In the ghetto on loudspeakers, and it was 62 panicking. You see sometimes the
moving is chaos, but luckily, my father met his brother and said we should go over there.
We went over to the house where he was. A barrack, maybe 500 men living in one block.
But we couldn't get in. Of course, it was occupied. We were sitting outside the whole
night, holding together my mother, father, brother, and my aunt came outside and
everybody should get out from the houses.

Q: Is this because the bombs were coming?

A: No, no bombs. It was like chaos. The people were hiding and running like it was a raid,
an air raid. It was a raid for the Germans, and anything was trying to escape from the
ghettos, he shoot them right on the spot. They surrounded. The whole army was there.
They put and said, this, this, this, move the people. Let's go. Set up in a line and you're
going. They took them on a ride. My mother, my father, my brother was in one side and
my uncle was on the other, and they took us from the ghetto and they took us to the place
where the people are working, to the airport. But they didn't take us to the airport. They
was taking you can see it on the map if you have a map of this. They took us
down to the train and the trains -- we were walking maybe halfa day, andthe __— were
laughing, spitting on us, having a good 63 time. We didn't know where we are going. We
didn't believe them. We didn't go to the fork. We are going downtown, you know. It was
a little bit, but we saw the dead constant. We saw dead people. It is not simple what I am
saying. People are falling like flies. They are shooting people, people who can't work.
They take pistol out and shooting people came to work like dogs. We coming into this
train station there. There was wagons like you have in the museum in Washington, full of
stenching, stinking, you know, from the cow and they said one, two, three, four, five, in
here. And my father all together in here and somehow we managed, me, my father and
my mother. We went and my uncle and this family all in the same wagon?

Q: Your brother too?
A: My brother too. Of course, my two cousins cause one was dead already in the ghetto and
brother and about another 50 people. And we were sitting there a day. We didn't know
what was going to be. It was hot outside like this time of the year, and then all of a
sudden they said and came and closed up. They closed us up right away, like a cow. We
couldn't go out and there was wires on the little window and they announced the train
start moving, you know, like toot, 64 toot, start moving. It was going to take us to
Danzig. We didn't know where we were going really and we didn't have any food,
anything in this train this time. Absolutely nothing. And we were going a whole day and
people have to go and piss water and stool and there was nowhere to go, and there was a
bucket and how much 50 people in a bucket? And some people were a little embarrassed,
women and men, but in this time you didn't see these things. This was when you have to
do these things, trying to the little window to pull out the side and the Germans
were sitting on the roof and knocking them down banging over the head. And I remember
we were going and going and all of sudden the train stop, and there was a bucket of food,
like for the people, you know. I don't remember. It was like in a paper, a piece of bread.
People were trying to grab and it one of the guys was there and said, wait a second. We
all in the same boat. Let's try to be humanized, not like animals.
Q: What said this?
A: Another -- my father said, no. There was a man and my father said to him some who have
these whatever food was there and we was going traveling like this maybe three
days. And we saw to the front the wagon the city, is going to and places. 65
People are leaving and and we go to the station where the train is, has to go to a
station sometimes stopping because they have to give it right of way to other trains. And
there was a life going on. Normal people are dressed and, you know, laughing, reading
newspaper and outside, and we were going to die. Of course, and then we came closer to
the German part and we came to Germany. We didn't know where we were going. We are
going back and forth. And then all of sudden my cousin was -- one of the cars wanted to
jump to the train and get a ride, but somehow the wagon got caught, a little cut in the
middle of night. He got open the top and trying to crawl and he have succeeded right on
the roofs. He could not escape from the train either. We are going and all of a sudden
Danzig. We saw a sign the train stopped in Stutthof, and said to us we go
out and we couldn't breathe anymore, and the urine and the stool and we didn't make it,
but we didn't make in, not in our pant. And we made it on the floor. It was full with the
cows. It was a disaster. I think maybe another day we be choked on the fumes. They stop
the train and he said men men separate and fathers separate, and then, of
course, they took away. I said bye to my mother and my aunt and all this, and 66 we had
a piece of bread and I gave to my mother, I remember and Reds came and
but some were a little younger because some came from the ghetto and they was
mixed up. And in the ghetto there was a few youngsters my age. They went with the
mother. Instead of I went with my father and my brother. I stayed with the men side, but

it didn't take too long soon. They took out the was left more room with, because
they took out. They didn't put in new people. We saw people with the stripes. Already
was during the war, taking the people in the camp and we waved before the door closed
up and waved to my mother and that's it. The train started blowing the whistle and going
with a run away full speed, we going again, maybe a day or two days. And there was a
stop again and they give us water to drink and they put a bucket and one glass, I think,
and there was a glass, a can they give us. Drink whatever and we came in the Dachau.
We saw to this camp, overheard. People knew about already about Dachau and things
like this. We came into Dachau and instead of no this one is. We shouldn't stay
here on this train. This is train is going to Landsberg, not to Dachau and this train is
going this way. And then we going backwards, you know, they put another -- they going
to the machine to 67 pull us out. We are in the camp, they pull us out and we are going
back. And this would take maybe about three or four hour, and we came in away from
Dachau and came in a place and they and we walked out. We don't see nothing.
An empty spot. This was Landsberg blocks made out of cardboard you see like the tins,
like paper and right away they start kicking you. So the people, you know, with the

not the Jews, but they had Jewish stars with a "V" like up sideway
Germans also some of them and they were it -- and it almost people,
you know. Whatever they called them. You know, it was all kind of people there.
Murderers. They put them in this place. The guy, the guy he was already a Meister over
us the Kapo and they are doing the whole thing and some who have them
they put us right away kicking and kicking, and they take us to a big build and they said,
you are going to be unclothed and to clean us up. We don't know what is happening and
here I am holding with my brother and father and things like this. They coming in
Dachau hundreds of people. A whole big thing going on and we have to walk
over to this building and stay alive. You are going to get a shower and a uniform, and
everything you possesses if somebody has something from the 68 ghetto, whatever it is.
There was a new German at a table and give it to them. You have to be completely
undressed when you go into the shower. We knew. We heard about the stories of the
crematorium and this, but somehow we didn't feel this a working camp and the guys said,
don't worry. You are going to work and you people was and they put us in over
there and everything. One was undressed and some of them had some ring hiding,
whatever, something, whatever they brought from ghetto. They all together.
There was 5,000 people in this camp and maybe there is a couple thousand people. They
call a transport in the train and they came from other places and put everything over
there. We have to undress and we have to go into in this . We have to wait but we
don't know. We don't see people coming out. There was another exit and we saw people
coming out dressed already. So we had a feeling this was -- so we go in and everybody
was undressed and Jewish people and men. There was there before us not just Jewish
people no. They had some spray. You started to spray you under the arm, on the
part, the men part, over the hair. They try spray it right in your eye. They was laughing.
This was already a working camp. There was the . Anyway, they put us in the
showers. A 69 whole building sort of this. There was water coming out. It was ice cold.
This was terrible. People passed out, and then it was a little bit warm and we went

through this one. And there was uniforms waiting on the other side and look. And they
said, look, ___ some for them was too short. Everybody get a uniform. I got a uniform. I
was lost in it and this man said give me this one and I switched with him. There was no
shirt or nothing. Just a uniform with stripes and little hat. They kicked us, of course, and
there were German people working there. And they put us in a line and said one, two,
three, four, you go in this part. And one, two, three, four, and number one is -- it
two and somehow I stick with my, with my uncle. I don't know what's happen today. My
cousin, he's disappeared I was holding onto my father and we falling. In the
beginning in one barrack and come back there was nothing for the dig. There was
cardboard made. It was a digged out on the inside and there was made from cardboard
and nothing. The was still warm, but you were making the box yourself and the
box then the next we have to stay there and we were sleeping there. There was a
little, little bit straw under the bed. Lay down and no pillows or nothing. This was where
we sleep. This 70 was with the working camp. This was the building. Camp was built by
this time that we came in, and we stay overnight and sometime before we came to the
barracks -- I skipped something. I have to go back. They said to the people, where are
your possessions? All of the people before they go into the shower, they have had a ditch
out like a toilet and you sit over this and behind, and they make the and you can
see it was falling. There was people before. There was a ditch there where people before.
It was a long ditch I would say around five or six hundred foot long. And when they
came out and said -- a lot of people, you know, saving diamond ring or some money,
whatever they had from the ghetto, throw it in the ditch to give to the Germans.
Somehow they give to the Germans. Somehow they had work for it and they came out
and they said they'd like to have all the doctors, the lawyers. I have special work for them
and we have a lot of intelligent people there. My father was going but I can't. I'm too
young, but my father didn't want to raise his hand to say he was not a doctor, but Jewish
people are a lot of intelligent people. But before the people, they tell them before they
told the people that had the uniform before they went to the back, undress I'm going to
give special 71 work for you. You are going to go inside and take out with your hand
whatever you find this. You have to take out the wastes from the people with their hand.
And there was maybe a two foot or one foot and the fumes and the heat, and it was
drying from the sun. It was smelly in this area. You couldn't get -- you could get far
away. People going in, half of them didn't go out. And they fall in. They pull them out,
dead. And they fall in. We thought we never survive this. They came out smelling, you
know, the people that came out that survived. Of course, they didn't let them in. They
took I didn't see because they said one of them, this is the work that you Jews
are going to get. For us this was intelligent. This is what you have to do. You have no
right to be a doctor or a lawyer or whatever it was. Of course, I was not in the ditch. I
stayed in the back, and in the morning we hear a whistle and there was a place to
go out and they said to us, make groups we are going to work in . It's about four or
five kilometers from this area. And at the same time you are going to make a building
barracks for us, you know, to give us a paradise. We going to be in heaven and they took
the group and this time I was lucky and stay with my father and brother and stay in the
same 72 line. There was a -- there was a man Bergman(ph) he was also from the ghetto.

He was a Kapo. He was nice to me. He was already with our group but he was an
intelligent person and these in the was a leader in the Gestapo and he raised his
hand. He spoke fluent German. You are going to be in charge and make group and make
the groups together and to tell for the people. And we had a number. This number is
going with this one, and we are going to this field to work. It was an empty field. There
was nothing there. It was completely flat. We going to start from scratch and tell us what
to do. And everybody have to take is a shovel and start digging. We are organized
already before us and there were some spots already built. And this was the work we are
going to do and we work the whole day. And we didn't know what we are doing. And
they come with machinery and bulldozers, bulldozers and building up a mountain and we
couldn't understand why they building a mountain. There was fog in this area, and for a
while you could see and they build a mountain and they have a plan what to do. They
going to make a bunker. How you going to make a bunker from a mountain? They make
it maybe to be two-mile long and quarter wide and this was our job there. Our job to put
in with the 73 sand and bring it in and coming with bulldozers we create a
mountain.

Tape #3

Q: You were describing this bunker, this mountain?

A: Right. They are building up, of course, coming in with big train and filling it up and
soften up and build. You go up the mountain and then when this was done, they put like a
little layer of grass and put in sticks, metal sticks. All that was maybe a mile was metal
that was maybe two or three foot long, all over. You couldn't pass by and then in the
machinery on each side of the mountain of the and start putting in cement and
there was machinery coming in with for other camp. And we had to stay with

and build all this, like stages, like steps and push away the gate then run down.
They started from the and they made the gates from wood and, of course, they
doing this and filled up the hill and made the other up and build up and they
build up maybe four or five foot ditch, and they cover up the whole mountain with
cement. And then they came with the machinery and start digging up and move away the

farther away and start digging in two or three foot. It was very deep. You could
see down. It was 74 like the 15-floor deep in the floor and they started filling up with
cement again. They made it I would say, the size of this room. I would say about 40 foot
thick, thick cement all around, fully up to the hill of the mountain. And when they are
doing it they made a downstair and made like corridors, and you could walk in the
cement and they came with bulldozer. Later on they come bury the whole thing in the
ground and from the outside stick out just the mountain and all this cement was built up
so heavy. They put layers of grass and then when you looked at this, it look like a
mountain, like a normal hill. Only sometimes we are were doing this type of work and we
had the Jewish -- this was really like we have the Jewish system -- it was really the time
people used to fall in the cement and never came out. And I think hundreds of people
buried. Almost I fall in there but I was lucky this time again and wasn't working there.
And my father was falling a lot because the work was so hard and stinking in the night
time, and from the cement and the powder and the water, and I can't even explain, and it
was going on. I can't even explain the way it was working. It is like you see a factory
with machines and not stopping, and it was going on and people dying. The guards would
say, give an 75 example, a hundred people from my group. Two is missing all the time.
Every day was dead people there. And there was the work we are doing there and when
we had the mountain down. And this and they came to start from the beginning and came
with machinery and dig out the inside and made another empty stadium answer inside,
like you see the dome where they play the football. That's the way it looked inside from
the ground. But before this was going on there was work I had to do. It was work we
have to going on constant until the end of liberation. It was not completely
finished. I am giving the picture of the way this is building it, and I was working with my
father there at this time. And there was a German that was in charge of our group, but
somehow I was away, say I was lucky. I was never lazy. It just like the way I was, work.
But I was watching him. He wasn't watching me. It was survival and my brother not so
watchful, always get a little and all this. But in the time we were working there,
we been through a lot of experiences. But to start with the experience that I will begin

with is we were working there one day. I was going out to work and there was a
I men, already a Jewish man. He was putting together the groups. There was a
man, a 76 German, came out and said, who speaks good German? I didn't speak so well
German but I figure I raise my hand. You speak German? I got a job for you. He said I
should take this briefcase and come in there, and you going to have a job. You
going to be the fire. You going to put fire in the ovens for the soldiers. They had maybe
15 little boxes and had three or four soldiers which can go inside and warm up the hands.
We work also in the wintertime there. But doing this I felt a little bit free. 1 could go and
after bringing coals for the -- when I left my father and brother working on this bunker
that they were working. And one day my father came and they almost killed me. The
same German that was nice, my father told -- he told my father, he told me to leave the
job. Nothing like this. Anyway, there was my father he was beaten up because I have left
the place. It was not his fault. It was not my fault. I lucky to get a better job. In this job I
was doing I was constantly going out and getting fire for the soldiers, putting in fire for
the ovens for the soldiers are and just by doing this I had a little bit there was
soldiers all around the area, and nobody was in back of -- he says I use today. Go and
take a bag and fill up the bag with coal and go back 77 with the coal. And meanwhile, I
pass by the place they were building the bunker and without a guard, and by doing this I
was putting the fire in the ovens. There was a lot of Germans used to peeling potatos, of
apple or something, and used to go into my pocket. But I didn't have the heart to eat it,
and I used to always feel like I have a duty to give the food to my father and my brother
because I had it much easier than they did. And this was going on for quite a while. I was
doing this type of work, but in the time this experience I had one day a German came to
me come we me. Take my briefcase case and come with me. You come with me.
They took me out and I was going maybe for a mile, and this time the war was coming
close. Airplanes were coming to bomb Germany and this was the time of -- it was still a
long time for me. I thought it would never end. But really the Americans were getting
involved already and bombing Berlin. And this German, I was walking with him and all
of a sudden these two airplanes, these MIGS, it was two MIGS, MIGS or something,
Americans. They came so low because it was so empty at the -- came down with
machine, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta and on me and this German. And he was a big German and I don't
know, he had a big -- he was not maybe they had so many 78 titles but I don't
know. He was a big man too, and he was going to mail something. He thought maybe I
was going to -- I was going around and said to put the coals. Now, you go with me and he
said to go with him. I go with him and take this briefcase when the airplanes came on us,
there was no way. There was a little tree far away, but this was nothing. They were
building -- they are building for to land for airplanes in the bunker. And then he said to
me, stay still. And he just took his hat and the airplane go by and he took off his hat, and
took off his hat. He throw this on the ground and lay on his back and head to the side.
And I thought he was dead. He's dead. I really thought he was dead. But he was not dead,
but then the airplane passed by. He said he talked to me to stay straight. You
shouldn't move. You can look up if you want to see the airplane. He was so smart, but
airplanes came down again and they saw him laying down and they raised up and stopped
shooting. They raised up and they disappeared. Then I stand up and I am smarter than

them. He noticed it was . He could be dead. He was lucky that he didn't get a
bullet. If he would be dead, I would not be alive either. This was one was experience.
However, I will tell another experience. I was 79 walking around with another German
soldier and he was from the Wehrmacht, and he walked over to me one day. You thought
I look like his brother. He was blonde with blue eyes, beautiful young man. I see
nice man. He was a good looking man and I looked up at him. And he was so uniform --
he was not in SS. he was from the Wehrmacht, from the soldier, and then ghetto. I look
like his brother and he was on duty and he was guiding the people. They were walking
and every group had a soldier to watch them, and everyone had a Meister soldier to
watch them and there was a Meister, the people that give you the orders to every day. I
have duty. I will give you a leave it and you pick it up, and this can't be a
German. Was a good person, a good man but this was one was going on for a while and
then one day raid and this time we were walking there, and it was also full of the
bunker they are building. A little farther away was like wood and one of us was going to
the truck and it was muddy and you go in muck. And I sat in this area I looked for my
father all the time and my brother. And every time I had something in my pocket and
bring it to them and they were working in this area, and so bring it to them because they
were working in this area. The guard was standing farther away a 80 few other
with work other sections. Block number five, six, seven, eight and there were
another blocks to make. There was were a few other to make ten, nine, whatever and
there more barracks on the other side. Then I happened to be there in that area and all ofa
sudden the the raid was there and everybody had to lay. This good German was
with this group. I saw him before. I didn't talk to him so often. I looked like his brother.
He gave mea he told me a little bit, about the story, where he came, and I didn't
know he was from Germany. He was from or something. He told me a little bit
about his family. He don't know where his family is. He complained a little bit and this
was the raid. And everybody had to lay down and throw everything down and be still.
The airplanes were coming down. They was going down to look like bomb. Knew
nothing, we were not too far away from Munich. This was not bombing. They was going
to Berlin. Everybody lay down. There was a Jewish group, most of them were Jewish. I
was not in this group but I have to lay down at this, if I am and this German was a good
German. And there was a few other soldiers and this good German, and a few other
soldiers standing there. And he was not sitting down on the ground. He was 81 standing
nicely and leaning against a tree and the airplanes making noises, and all of a sudden the
noises stop and noises and then, all of stop. You have to wait, not to move until the noise
comes back. Then because the raid is over, when they pass by they can make you are
even signals at a couple miles away. And they start working again. And then raid
was going on one. Men felt uncomfortable maybe going to 50 foot from one end to the
other, start calling to go on the other side. My good friend took out a pistol and shot him
right in the head and his head blow off. He had a bullet, and everybody gets
frightened. And I remember I was a little farther away from me but the blood was all
over, and there was a drop of blood on me, a mark, my stomach. Oh, my God, I am going
to be alive. It was a nice German and all of a sudden. The raid it is over and
everybody stand up to go back to the place they work. I didn't see him the second day

later. I was supposed to come again because it was maybe going on for a month or
something. Everything time there a piece of bread, whatever, cheese. The next day I was
afraid to go over and pick it up, but I felt I was not I was a young fellow. I didn't have
had no, couldn't say. I was an intelligent person, so many schools and years, 82 but I
learned to be a human being before the war start. Wait a second. If I am not going to go
to him he might shoot me or whatever, might shoot. And I had the going on -- he was
never there. When I put the wood and some of the __ said if I met him, you
know, I play dumb. Why? Should I? You, this swine is this pig. You know, he could kill
us. All because of him we be bumped from the Americans two mile in the air. There were
you put up aluminium foil against raid. And anyway, I lost me a couple days but he was

I was going a couple days and -- army we used to keep the solders not too often.
There was a couple and they was going and then this from there. Then I had the
experience they used to come in the camp and they putting the woman to works in the
area and in our camp. They want the woman for the other camp and they were working
the kitchens there and cleaning for the soldiers and also working other places. The older
lady with no hair look like boy and uniforms, and they used to make get a shower. Once
in a while they build a nice -- it was a barrack but it was better than the first one. And
they had a little corridor and they were so even in a working camp. They put in
the people in the shower and most of them then we were all men and some men had a 83
desire, and they put a woman undressed, completely naked and she would going and
maneuver the water to make the water, to turn on the water. And there I was afraid. I was
alive but some people were still in the -- men have a desire for a woman. You could see
in the part, and have a desire and they would come in with a raincoat and came in with a
stick and right, smacking the people on the part, and it was painful and some of them
died. Some of them pulled them out dead. Until they found out this the Jewish
man was the leader. Some of them not coming to work they kill about 155 people that I
remember. They thought this was none.

Q: Did you see this?

A: I saw it. I was there. Took a man and German man walked over and knocked him right
over the part and passed out. And some of them, you know, come back to the bleeding
again, and some of this -- then they start playing around with the water, hot water, cold
water, and hot water, that this working camp. And it is a distinct -- and I had another
experience. In the same camp was mixed. They brought other people to work there,
Jewish people too, not too many and there came a -- police came from the I
don't know exactly. He was from Hungary or something. He came 84 in later and he
somehow had brought in a cross, you know, and people were sleeping. Before this
barrack was made out of wood, dig out a ditch, like this side come down like this, and
was ground and put the -- we didn't have straw. Didn't have a pillow and gave us a
blanket to wrap up, blanket with straw, and this was our pillows. And this police was, of
course -- a mahogany cross -- and it was this size with Jewish and fancy with a chain, and
he used to tell me story from the bible and he was a very learned person. We talked about
the Jewish religion Jewish and Christian religion. Somehow at this time we are suffering,

we all recall it was no different. I think, I think, the make is different but we all
the same people. And then he said to me and this barrack this man that was involved with
the for the work. He said that we should work three shifts. We should work eight
hours and constantly working over there, day or night and sometimes in the day shift and
sometimes in the middle shift, and sometimes I was in the night shift and the work after
the job, and one -- it was a Sunday this time -- and I came from the night shift, come in
the day shift, you know, to switch around. And I was another time I used to go away he
said to me always, he called me Israel will you put this 85 away? And I dug out
with my hand a little hole and I keep this tied together and put it in a little straw
until -- it was my -- I didn't care. Respect was having. Didn't bother me. He was with us
maybe a month or two months. They were switching around people from the barracks.
My brother and father was there too in the barrack, and then they took my father to a
different barrack and then they try to switch around barracks, together but the
priest used to hide. It was a Sunday. I came from the day shift to start working for night
and from day shift and we had to switch around shifts, but anyway, he put on the cross
and there used to be a gentile people and make a mess for the gentile people and he was
going to the -- he was going to the I said the ditch but we never -- it was snowing
outside. It was like cold. We were there. It was raining and wet snow and it was really
snowing, and we walked out with this. I could hear scream and halt, halt, halt, because he
was close, but I didn't -- stop, stop, stop. Anyway, we heard scream and we hear shooting
and, of course, there was a little window to look out and we keep going to the ditch to the
window. There was this priest and the Germans and the soldiers around the camp, and
there was the like they were 86 watching like in a prison and they told him to
stop, stop. And going out for the soldiers they could go in the camp for a second. There
were doors. They could open form them. For us they couldn't. And they walked in and he
said he said, he made a noise. It was so quiet this time. It was snowing and they
dropped him and they put him right away from the rifle and took him in the headquarters.
Maybe a half hour later they brought him back to the camp and they said to the -- and
brought up a chair and which is go outside to put him in the chair. And it was
snowing and cold outside and some of them came from work. I just came from work. I
was wet and tired. Even I did my work not so bad but come back from working to the
barracks you get wet, you don't get an umbrella. Everybody had to go out and everybody
have to go out. There was people in this camp and one of the Germans put a chair and
stand on the chair. I'm going to show you what Gods can do for you, and put the priest in
the chair. And everybody had to go by and spit on him and then one of the Germans took

experience I had. I had another experience my brother, rest in peace. I was going with the
coals and they choose my brother to take the canister and go to the kitchen to bring the
soup for the group that were working. And there was a tall man. He was a tall man. My
brother was compared to the men, he was not so tall. We would not survive if we were
little bit. He was shorter than the other guy and this guy was maybe 6'2" and my brother
was 5'8" and lucky because this was survival, because we were not too little. And he
went out to get the soup for the men to eat, and it was snowing and the weather was damp
and wet and there was tracks going in from the trains where they were working. I -- it's
hard to make a picture, what was going on. 88 Unbelievable things. Barracks with
machine and all kind of machinery was standing there, and you had to go to a factory.
There was building with a big thing, and my brother went to the kitchen like it and I was
there walking around, not too far away, because there was the oven, the wood to put in
the for soldiers, because they were guarding them, and I saw my brother going. I was
happy he got -- at least he have an easier job then. I was working hard too. The coals
were so heavy I thought I'd die. I couldn't pick it up sometimes. I was afraid not enough
coals, afraid not enough coal, and a few times the Germans said there was what you are
taking and smack a kick and all this stuff. They were not so gentle to me. I got beat up
more than one time. I took it, with somebody on your back all the time. And my brother
walked over to the -- not to too far away from the place that have to bring the soup. It
was a canister and it was wintertime and it was snowing. It was wet and this can slided,
and he was short and it slide right on him, and the can kicked him over. And he fall down
and this on up the gate and this soup spill on the ground. This the this German
and my father was not run over to me, got this metal. This pipe, it was maybe about six,
seven foot long and they gave it 89 right on my brother on the back one time. The second
time he turned away, only he collapsed. He was laying there and they said you it
was not his fault. He stepped in the truck rail from the truck and he fall down. And of
course, I was there and the people and they run over to him, and I drop my sack of coals
and my father, father said my brother's dead, he's dead. I feel bad about him
because I was lucky. And he comes up, blood from the mouth, and we thought he was
dying. He finished. But he survive and my father try to pick him up. And these Germans,
what are you doing? Here, I said. I am taking the coal and this my father and brother. But
there was other German, so it's okay. They made another group to pick up the soup
because there was enough -- not soup. It was water, and my father and I couldn't stay
there, and I see my brother start talking and I see he was going to be okay. And they
wiping off the blood and he made it. And he had to make believe he was walking, and
they came back, go back to the camp. I wasn't going back to the camp, of course. I went
in the barrack so I couldn't -- we didn't know what happened to him. This Dr. there
time was physician for the camp, and my father was -- I was mentioning that he had a
cyst on his foot, and 90 he operated on him. And it was in the camp, sort of like a
first aid, but I want to -- my brother was not anymore him. He was really weak but he had
to fight and somehow he was going to come to -- it's going to come to a head. We saw the
airplanes and the whole thing going on and we felt make we have a chance. Who knows?
This was going on for quite a while but when I was walking, making the coals, I was
something to tell. You have to hear this. There was a wagon, a train standing outside with

time and show it to me and they put the people in there and put them on fire and he had a
satisfaction. And one was working, not a murderer. You could see on his face. Maybe he

for him. One time he said I should take his plate and it wash out and cook him some
soup. it was like a soup the soldiers had. I go outside. There was a train. I took
this sand and wiped it out in this bucket. I made it look like a mirror and I came back.

bought maybe three or four pots of the soup and he didn't want me to be there when he
was eating. And I came out and later on I came in washed the thing and I didn't see him. I
take off my little hat that I had and that's when any time I used to go to the bath
and take off my jacket. When I had my uniform and put it by the oven andifIhada

charge, the guard. Then the soldiers walked in and I was not there, and he looked like he

fingernails were hanging on the wood. He died from pain. It was what I saw they did to
the man. He wanted to go to Budapest.
