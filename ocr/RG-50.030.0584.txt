see us, thank you for agreeing to meet and talk with us. I’d like to start, Mrs. Lowy,
wi — like a fairy tale, at the beginning. When were you born; where were you born;
who were your parents? Can you tell us a little bit about the world that you came to
know from the very beginning?
A: My name is Edith Lowy. I was born Edi — Edita(ph) Pickova(ph), p-i-

RG-50.030*0584 ,
A: And I was born in a very small coal mining community in Silesia. The name of
the community was Lazy, l-a-z-y. And at the age of five, we moved to another small
coal mining community, and — by the name Poruba, p-o-r-u-b-a.
Q: And what country was this?
A: Czechoslovakia.
Q: Was this north of Prague, south of Prague?
A: It was closer to the Polish border.
Q: I see, I see. And do you —
A: The closest large city was Ostrava.
Q: I see. Oh, yeah. And what was your first language?
A: My first language was Czech. My parents spoke Czech and German, so I was
exposed to the German language also. Although people in the community, the coal
miners, spoke their own language, which was a mixture of Czech and some Polish
and my father really didn’t want us to speak it. My mother spoke because my
parents had the general store, and the customers spoke — spoke this language. So my
mother could easily speak with them, but my father refused, and we had to speak
pure Czech.
Q: Well, it sounds like it was like a local patois, a local lingo.
A: Dialect, yeah.
Q: Yes.

A: Right. And —
Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?
A: [had a brother, two year — two years old — young — younger brother, Erik, e-r-i-
k. As I said before, my parents had the general store. By the standard of the
community, we were very well-to-do, but we were really not wealthy. We just — we
lived on the main street, the street didn’t have a name, it — it was just a main street.
On one side of our home was a baker, on the other side was a butcher. And we
didn’t have very much to do with the butcher, but the butcher’s daughter was my
closest friend.
Q: Were they Jewish, too?
A: No. [had no Jewish fr-friends at all at this time.
Q: Was there a Jewish community in this town?
A: There was a Jewish community, not in Poruba where we lived, but in a little bit
larger community called Orlova, o-r-l-o-v-a, Orlova. And there was a beautiful
synagogue and there was a large Jewish community. In my immediate community,
only my grandfather, with his two daughter, who were n— daughters who were not
married yet, they also had two general stores. Iear(ph), the neighbor’s — the baker’s
daughter was my closest friend, and we are still friends. Actually I spoke to her a
few — few days ago.
Q: That’s nice. That’s very nice that something can last so many decades.

A: So many decades, and so many different times when we didn’t know about each
other. Where she didn’t — where sh — where she was afraid to have anything to do
with me, under communists, you know, so —
Q: Yes. So tell me a little bit, how is it that your parents — your family came to be in
this small coal mining town? How many — were they new to it, wer — had they been
there for generations?
A: No, no, they lived there for a long time, my grandparents lived there for a long
time. And as I said, nearby was a larger Jewish community.
Q: What — what do you know of your family history that your parents and
grandparents might have told you about?
A: My —I was very close to my mother’s father, to my grandfather, because he lived
in the same community. And my mother was the oldest of six girls, and one son. I
was always told that my mother was the most intelligent of the six, although each
one was very talented, each one had the special talent; music, painting, piano. Each
one was very talented. But my mother liked books, and my father was from
Moravia and he was very proud that he was born near the place where the beloved
President Masaryk was born.
Q: Ah yes, ah, yes.
A: And—-

A: He was a businessman, he was trained in Vienna in business, and my mother was
much more interested in literature and — and education, although my father — also,
both our parents were very, very concerned about our in — our education. And I
remember my mother was dreaming to send us to Switzerland to get the good educa
— rounded education.
Q: How did they meet?
A: I was told only few years ago, when I went to visit my cousin in Jerusalem, who
adored my parents, she told me that they met through a traveling salesman. And then
they fell in — I was told they fell in love with each other’s handwriting.
Q: That’s very romantic.
A: And my father — both my parents were in the — wonderful people. I have never
seen anybody come of our home empty handed. Gypsies, who people resented and
were afraid of, my parents always loaded with clothes and food and — and my
mother all the — always taught me, give, and it will be given to you. Wish, and it will
be wished out to you.
Q: Has it — has it fulfilled itself, this thing —
A: In most ways.
Q: Yeah?
A: Yes. But, as you know, with the fate they faced, life was not really as great and
people were not as great, always.

Q: Yeah. We’ll come to that moment. What are your earliest memories?
A: So, my earliest memories o-of my parents are Mother sitting at the end of the day
on the stove in the kitchen, after we went to bed, and when I went back to the
kitchen, always she was sitting on the stove reading books.
Q: Did she work in the store?
A: Yes, both my parents work in the store, and we had a housekeeper, live-in
housekeeper always. And the people in the community were wonderful people,
honest people. And only when I came back after the war, I realized how much they
loved and admired my parents. Only when I came back I really appreciated it.
Q: How -— that’s — how did that show itself?
A: I will talk — tell you at the —
Q: Okay.
A: — end when we came back what happened.
Q: Okay, okay. And what are your — that — so your earliest memory of your mother
is sitting that — is that she’s sitting on the stove reading a book.
A: Right, always reading. And my father was more outdoorsy. Both of my parents
were very people oriented. Both loved people and people loved them, both of them.
But my mother was quieter. As I said, intelligent, thoughtful. My father was more
outdoorsy. He loved gardening and this I inherited from him. Also, my memories are
of my mother singing a lot, and she sang a lot of Germans songs, operettas and — and

I still remember them so well. Although, she sang nicely and I cannot carry the tune.
And m — as — my best friend was Icar(ph) and we read the same books and we
played with our dolls, and they had the double seat swing in the garden, two seats
facing each other. And when we later moved into our home, I bought a swing like
this, just because of the memories.
Q: So, what year were you born in?
A: I was born in 1928, December twent — 1928. And my brother Erik was born two
years and two months later.
Q: So the years that you grew up were the 1930s, and you — and you grew up then, I
would say in a— ina small town, small place, near — near the Polish border. And did
political events make themselves felt at all?
A: Only in 1938
Q: What happened?
A: I never — I have to tell you that I never, ever heard the word anti-Semitism.
Q: That was going to be one of my questions.
A: Never, never. I was the only Jew in sport, I was the only Jew in school. I never,
never felt anti-Semitism, until I came to Poland.
Q: What happened then, in the late — in 1938? Did —

my father used to take the older son, Walter, and Erik, and me for a walk, and we
walked to the ponds. And my father made whistles for us. In the meantime my
mother cooked a very delicious lunch. And from the ponds, either we went to the —
to Orlova, to the nearest community — there was a wonderful pastry shop, so my
father bought pastries that we all like, especially my mother. Or we went to am — to
a nursery. When they got — it was Mr. S-Slama(ph). Slama(ph) means straw.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And I guess my love for nurseries is since then.
Q: Why are you —
A: So — and then in the afternoon, we used to go to my grandpa, who had a — most of
my mother’s sisters and families came, and my grandpa pan — played cards with his
sons-in-law, and we had our cousins and the neighborhood children, and my fa — my
grandpa had the very nice garden, and many more flowers than we had. And my
father took care of my grandpa’s garden. And behind the garden was a brook.
Q: Sounds ideal.
A: And geese, and a little bridge to a meadow, and I loved to go to the meadows and
pick Lilies of the Valleys, and — and forget-me-nots. And it was very — a very
pastoral setting behind my grandpa. So m — then, in 1938, the — the Germans took

Q: Yeah.
A: — and the Polish army marched into our part of Silesia. And as Jews we had to
vacate. I think they gave us a month to vacate. Now, to go in — deeper into
Czechoslovakia, there was no reason to go because Germans already occupied part
of it. So, we opted to go to Poland where my grandfather had a brother, a wonderful
man. And we — we went to a smaller community near Krakow, Poland, and there
we wanted to wait for the rest of the family because we — we knew that they all will
have to eventually come.
Q: What was the name of this community, this place?
A: I-In?

A: Prokocim, p-r-o-k-o-c-i-m, Proko —
Q: So when you had to vacate, did that mean you had to leave your store?
A: We had to leave the store, the home, everything. So I do not know, because I was
not so interested in the arrangements, I was 10 years old in ’38, Erik was only eight
when my parents made some kind of arrangement to give the house and the store. I
don’t know if they rented it, or what the arrangement was, to some acquaintances of
the baker’s family. My — my best friend’s family, with the understanding that if we
come back, it will revert to us. So we left practically everything. When we came to

learned quite fast, my father never could learn Polish.
Q: Did you see Polish soldiers in Poruba before you left?
A: No.
Q: Did you have any contact —
A: No.
Q: — with anybody Polish at all when — when you still —
A: When they occupied? No, it went very, very quickly. The army occupied and —
very quickly. And my grandfather was gravely ill in this time. So I remember that
they extended our stay, because Grandpa was dying, so we left after he died.
Q: I see.
A: In the beginning, in Poland — well, my — my mother’s sister, I mentioned her,
with the two children, they arrived. And my mother’s younger sister, whom I always
adored, she married just — just shortly before the outbreak of the war. And she
married somebody, an engineer from Ostrava, the [indecipherable] city.
Q: Oh, okay.
A: And so we waited for them, and we lived together in a building I think we rented,
an apartment. And for a few months, we were able to go to school, Erik and I, fora
short time.

Q: Yeah.
A: So, it was not so easy.
Q: What — what are your memories from that school?
A: Not much.
Q: Not much.
A: Not much, because it was very short.
Q: Did you remember saying goodbye to your best friend before leaving?
A: Yeah, of course, you know, it was very sad to leave everything we loved. And
then, in September ’39, Poland was occupied, and people were afraid of the — of the
German army, and many people ran. Whatever — packed whatever they could carry
with them, and ran away from the — away from the army.
Q: Do you mean Jews and Poles as well?

mother’s youngest sister, with her young husband, and my family went on a run. We
call it in Polish nowa(ph) chechken(ph), now on — on the run. In the meantime, my
mother’s other sister, the one with the two children, went back to Slovakia, because
Slovakia was still at peace at this time, and he, her husband was Slovak, so they

a terrible time, because the planes were coming, and we were so tired, carrying our
belongings. When the planes came we just hopped into some ditches, and I guess my
parents had some money to buy food. But it was very hard for them to see us kids to
walk and walk and walk and not having a place to rest or wash up. So eventually my
father decided to talk to a Polish — a farmer, and ask him to sell us two horses and a
buggy.
Q: And did he?
A: And he did, because he thought, better to get some money now, than if the
Germans will come and cos — confiscate this, I’ll get nothing. So he sold us two
horses. The horses became members of our family. We just — we loved the horses.
Q: How did you know that? Did your father say that he was — that this is what the
farmer told him? Or, you just supposed that this is — he was —
A: I don’t know.

cross a river, and the horses got stuck in the river, and we had to unpack some of the
load, and we had to get up — out and push —
Q: The buggy.
A: — the buggy. But we managed. And then, after — and I don’t know how — how
long we were out around. I don’t know exactly how long [indecipherable]. But
again, my father convince another farmer to take us to work for him. Then my father
and my uncle were work with the horses on the field. My mother and my aunt were
whatever needs to be done around the house.
Q: For someone who doesn’t speak Polish, he was very, very good.
A: He was — he was good, he could communicate. And ma — my mother could a
little bit better with her — what she was talking to the peasants — to the coal miners.
And so the farmer took us, and Erik and I took care of the cows, and I learned very
well how to milk cows. And again, I don’t know exactly how long we were there.
And then the Germans occupied Poland, and we decided, you know, let’s go back
home.

they found money.

A: Because Poland was the worst possible place. One day I was walking with my
brother, and my cousin, who had beautiful blonde hair. He was eight years old — he
was nine — nine, close to 10, my — Erik also, and I was 12. I was so proud at this
time that I could wear the — the white band. I was — I felt so grown up. I can wear it,
Erik cannot, he was not yet 10 years old. So one day we went for a walk and a
Polish teenager approached us, lit a match, and threw it into my cousin Walter’s
beautiful blonde hair. I felt so responsible, I was the older — I was terrified. I put out
the — the fire from his — and we ran home, and from this day on, I was terrified to
wear this white band.
Q: Was this the first time you saw an — you felt anti-Semitism from Poland — from
Poles.
A: That was — maybe one time before. I had the Christian friend who took me to
church once with her, and I heard some people making some anti-Semitic
comments, and that was the first time. And then the first really shocking experience
was when men, age I think 16 to 65, if I recall it correctly, had to assemble on an
assembly place somewhere. My father and my uncle were in there and we all went
with him, and we waited there all day. We brought him some food, and we didn’t
know what’s going to happen. In the evening they were loaded on trucks and taking
away. We had no idea where they went. I forgot to tell also, that during the time
when my father was working with the horses and moving furniture, we had the

uncle, they should go with him out of town to buy illegal meat, so he could sell it.
And my father wanted so desperately for the family to have something to live on,
that they agreed to do it. And they went, first of all, they were supposed to wear the
bands, which they didn’t. They were not allowed to leave the community.
Q: And they did.
A: And they did. Second — and thirdly, they were bringing in illegal meat. So, there
were dangers on so many side. When they — from the minute they left until they
came home, we were — this I remember so vividly, we were so afraid for their lives.
When —
Q: Had you seen anyone — I’m sorry to interrupt you — have you seen anyone at that
point, murdered? Or had you seen any corpses, or had you heard any stories?
A: No, no, not at this time. Not at this time. It was just this terrible fear that if he

they went and when they were suppo — we knew approximately when they will be
back, usually it was at night they were coming back. So we took turns waiting on the
street to listen if they are coming, and when we heard the horses from far, it was
such a relief. And they went — when they came home, they were s — frozen, literally.
The people and the — and the horses, everything was frozen, everything.

A: It was wintertime and when — I remember my — when my mother was taking my
father’s socks off, it was all ice, all ice. It was a terrible time for them. Anyway, so
my father was taken away on trucks, and we didn’t know when they will come back,
if they will come back. Few days later, they did come back, and told us that they are
working — I forgot also to s — to mention that when we came back after this running,
we were put into ghettos. So we moved from Prokocim to Wieliczka, which was a
well known city in Poland, to a ghetto. When my father was taken to this — on
trucks, and when he came back, he said that they are working on the railroad tracks
in Prokocim, where we used to live. So, they must have gotten permission to come
on train, because otherwise they wen — would not have been able to — to come. So,
one day they came home and they said that they heard that Jews from Wieliczka
will be deported. It sounded sad, but we still didn’t know what deported means, and
Q: So they were able to come back and forth afterwards?
A: In—right, in the evening. And they decided that first they have to save the kids,
so first Erik and me. We couldn't go all together, because a big group would —
Q: Be most —
A: — be too dangerous. So they decided one night, the kids are going, so we walked
the whole night until at dawn we came to my father’s — to the railroad tracks where

that this boxcar will not go anywhere. We were supposed to stay under the boxcar,
not to move, not to talk, not to whisper, until e — the evening, when my father would
take us out and take us into hiding. Well, I can, as a parent, I can imagine what it
must have been for my father having us under the boxcar, and my brother was a very
big rascal, so — very, very. And my father came, they took us into hiding to a Polish
family. And the next day they went to get Mother and my Aunt Polly. My mother
decided that she has still some things to put in order and that nothing can happen so
fast. My aunt should go and she promised she will come the next day. My aunt, of
course, didn't want to leave my mother, but in the end my mother convinced her go,
I am surely going to come the next day. The following day was too late. They
already — my — my father and uncle heard from some Germans who were in charge
and liked my father and my uncle that Jews from Wieliczka are already being
loaded on trains. My uncle somehow managed to convince the Germans to — to
come with him and bring some — some papers that Mother is needed to work in the
kitchen on the railroad tracks. But they went to the trains, but they could not find
her. Well, when we heard that Mother was taken, we were devastated, absolutely
devastated. The only thing we thought, well, maybe she went to another camp,
maybe the war will be over next week, and we will see her again.
Q: But this all was in 1939 - 1940?

to talk so much — one was on a roof and it was diagonally from a police station, and
it was in the city where we used to live, so people knew us. So my father and uncle
used to come in the evening, take off their bands, and always watching at night so
nobody would see them.
Q: Were you like in the attic area?
A: In the attic area. Another place was we were in a mai — on a main street, then one
night there was banging on the door, and we thought where somebody reported us,
but it happened that it was an accident between a motorcycle and a car, and they
were calling for help, so they were banging on the door. But everything was so
frightening, because — and then, the third place was the most unusual. The third
place, the Germans who liked my father and my uncle, offered that we can hide in
the storage room of the building where the German and Polish offices — officers
were, in the cellar.
Q: These were German soldiers?
A: N-N-No, German — I don’t think they were Nazis, they were German overseers
on the railroad tracks, and —

A: They were not military, but they were — right, not military. But I don’t think that
they were SS. I — they might have been. They might have been, but I am not sure. So
they offered we can hide in the cellar. The cellar, all that was in the cellar were
crates, huge crates like from some machines. And the entrance to this was from the
front of the building. No windows. No windows that — down to the cellar. So, we
didn’t know what weather was outside, we didn’t know anything. The only people
that knew that we are there, were our Polish neighbors, former Polish neighbor and
I’m also forgot-got to tell you that my parents were so desperate to get Erik and me
out when there was so much fear that we’ll be deported, or whatever, that the Polish
neighbors send once their son, in the early 20s to bring Erik and me to their house to
hide. It was before we were hiding in the other places. Wer — he came, and we were
sitting on the train, Erik and I already, with this Polish guy, when I decided I’m not
going anywhere with my parent — without my parents. So I ran out of the train, of
course, Erik a — behind me, and the guy behind me, and my parents were very, very
distraught that here — again we are here in danger, that we didn’t go into hiding. So,
the only people that knew that we are hiding there were the Polish family, and two
priests from a nearby church. And once in awhile they used to bring something and
hide in the shrubs, soups, coffee, you know, in the shrubs. So, my par — my father or
uncle took it out from under the shrubs at night. At night people were not working in
this building, you know. But —

A: Ladored both of them, but my aunt was always my favorite aunt. So, we were — I

some bottles to urinate in, in one of the crates, and every time we heard — and it was
quite often — Polish or — or German voices in front, talking in front of the door, we
jumped into the big crate, and we didn’t breathe.

A: Fine.
Q: All right.
A: But still, Poles were very anti-Semitic. If anybody would see my father going
there at night, we would — we would have been finished. The priests were
wonderful, and they offered to do Aryan paper for us. And we decided maybe that
would be another possibility to save ourself. So somehow my father and my uncle
obtained some hair dyeing solution. My aunt had beautiful black hair, bu — she was a
very pretty woman, very pretty woman. My father and my uncle could have passed
ano — as non-Jews. My uncle had blue eyes, blondish hair. My father also didn’t
have Jewish features, yo-you know. But Erik and I and my aunt — so we decided, at
least my aunt, when she dyes her hair, so it will be less risky. So they brought this
solution, and I was — they went to work, my father and my uncle, and I was pouring
this solution in her — into her hair, and rubbing it in, and rubbing it in, and she — it
didn’t do anything. She said put more, put more, put more. So I was pouring more
and rubbing in, and suddenly her hair was coming out in chunks. And sh — I could
see that she was ready to scream in — you know, how painful it was, and her hair was
burned, her skull was burned. And here I was a 12 year old kid, 13 year old kid, and

to do, you know, to ask for help? We couldn’t — she couldn’t scream —
Q: She was down in the ce — she was down in the cellar with you?
A: In the cellar, and we couldn’t — sh — sh —I could see the pain she was — she was
really in excruciating pain. So, by the evening when they came back, her hair was
gone, her beautiful hair was gone, and this was the end of Aryan paper. While we
were there, we heard about a labor camp, Jewish labor camp, in walking distance
actually, in Prokocim. So, I think the grow — grownups might have thought, well,
it’s probably safer to survive in a ca — labor camp. Labor, it means working, so we
will work, and the war will be probably — few months the war — war will be over.
It’s surely safer than in the cellar, e-every moment was really fear, fear, fear. So we
actually walked into the first labor camp.

Q: Not a bad job.
A: No, not — not a bad job, but we had, I remember, seven buckets, big buckets to —
to — of potatoes to peel, and there were big table with lots of potatoes, and the
women were sitting around it, and everybody was grabbing the biggest potatoes,
because it filled faster the bucket. We assumed that if we obey all the rules, we will
live. The first — there was one room, it was a sewing room, and that was actually our
meeting place where w — wife and husband, you know, the husband came to visit,
the boyfriends came to visit, it was our — our community room. And one day we
went sitting there in the evening when we heard terrible shots, and we froze, because
we haven’t si-si— heard anything like it before. Nobody moved, until in the morning
we heard that nine people tried to escape through the fence, and they were shot on
the fence. The fence was, at this time, not electrified. So, that was the first shock.
You better do what they tell you to do.

A: So, in the — we moved to — to the labor camp Plaszéw and in the group of my
friends were siblings, brother and sister, Lola and Henyik(ph). Lola was my age,
and Henyik(ph) was a little bit older and they had a younger brother Erik’s age, and
they had an older brother who was a policeman, camp policeman, and they had a
sister who also married shortly before that. So there were five kids from the same
family, no parents. Parents were gone, just the kids.

doors here? Okay. Yeah, pause. All right, I’m so sorry.
A: It’s okay.

siblings whose parents weren’t there any more, who probably had been deported or
— or lost somehow.
A: Right, right. One day, the policeman brother went with a group of prisoners who
are working outside of the camp, went with them out of the camp, and either he
bought, or somebody gave him a loaf of bread. And when he came to camp, they
found it, and they shot him. So that was another —

wonderful young man. Also, another memory I have of this camp is that there was a

friendly with the cook. Friendly meaning human — a human being to a human being,
nothing going on between them, just kind to each other. He was — and one night we
were in beds when two or three of the Nazis came in and ask, is Mrs. Ungar here?
And so she said yes. So they called her, they asked her, what is your name? And she

camp over there. I heard that this Goeth is a brutal — he is really a subhuman, you

and said — pointed to a rock on a hill ... and said, do you see this hill? That’s where

lucky. I don’t think so, he said. Nobody who was there was lucky. And it — but I was
lucky that my father and I were assigned to the same camp, which was Camp B. But

to ammunition factory, and my shifts were 12 hour shifts, one weekday, one
weeknight. My work was extremely difficult, extremely difficult. That was probably
my most difficult time in camp, physically. I was given — hand a tray with hundred
pieces of ammunition, tha-that big, and I had to carve rings around the ammunition.
My work was standing at a huge machine, 12 hours shifts, no place to sit or rest. I
had to open the machine, put the — take the ammunition, put it into the machine, take
the other ammunition out, like two motions. Oil was dripping on the ammunition
because the ammunition came out quite hot. My finger was burned to the bone, so
painful, I— and standing 12 hour and this motion to open this big machine, it was
unbelievable. I was so hungry, we were so hungry, so tired. I— when I talked for the
first time to a group of students, and I was showing them how I opened the machine,
I stopped talking. I forgot that I have a group of kids listening to me. I realized what

keep the bread for the next day, that if we have two slices, we’ll not be so hungry.
We still went hungry because we — it was so painful, the hunger was so different
from when we are hungry here. So different, it never went out of our mind. It was
constantly on our mind. One day we made crumbs, and we were hoping that if we
eat little crumbs, it will last. No matter what we did, it wasn’t. So one day, we were

me stand next to my father. And on this evening my father didn’t come. So I didn’t
know what happened to him. I took my bowl of soup and I went to his barrack. He
was in bed, and he said that he was too tired to come. I knew that it is impossible
because we were so hungry, would have crawled, you know, to — to get this piece of
bread. Only later I found out that he went by the camp’s kitchen, and he found a
carrot in a trashcan, which he took for me, and they caught him and they beat him so
terribly that he couldn’t move. But he wanted to hide his pain from me. Then, one
day, it was Yom Kippur, the holiest day, and — and people knew that I was writing,
and so they ask me if I could read something for a — they wanted to have a special —
some way to celebrate the holiday. I knew that my father will be at work, so I wrote
something. Not a poem, just a story, my memories of Yom Kippur at home,
comparing it to what we have now. And it was packed, it was packed and when I

my father. You know, I didn’t know that he will be there. And then my birthday is in

most beautiful gift. I carried it with me, I slept on it, I— I didn't leave it off my side.
I couldn’t believe how he risk his life to make it. If he would have been caught for
this lousy, rotten carrot, then he — he was beaten like this, they would catch him. So
I was really — I loved this comb. Then, when I finished my night shift, some of — a
little bit earlier, before the men went to work the day shift, so I sneaked into my
father’s barrack. I knew what I’1l find. All the men were sleeping and my father’s

often, they took us to delouse us, our clothes, our hair, us, to Camp A. When I came
to Camp A, a group of people were walking there, and I looked at them and I said,
are these human beings? Are these human beings? The people were yellow green;
their eyes, their teeth, their fingernails, everything was yellow green. I said, who are
these people? They were people from Camp C, the worst of the camp, which the
people were working — working with poisonous gases, and they were dying a slow
death. It was — the book I have about Skarzysko-Kamienna called, “Death Comes
in Yellow,” is because of the people. When we came to werk A, often, we have to —
they assembled us on a big assembly place, and we had to watch executions of
prisoners by hanging or by shooting. So, when I was — when we were supposed to
go to werk A, my emotions were really torn, because I was so happy to be able to
see my beloved aunt and uncle, but I was so afraid to see an-another execution. The
worse were also — okay — one day I was so tired working at this huge machine, and it
was the end of the shift, and I was — I just didn’t know what to do, I just — I didn’t —

the — after a few, he took the ammunition and with every one he knocked on my hair
and screamed, was ist ein das, was ist ein das? And then he walked away to his
office, which was off the machine room. After a few minutes he came back and
called me. As I was walking behind him, I knew. I knew what it meant. And I could
s—I could see the silence of the — I could hear the silence of my fellow prisoners
and I could see their tears as I was ma-marching behind him. And all I remember is
thinking, what will it do to my father when he finds out that he had lost me too? I—I
knew what my fate will be. I came to his office, and he looked at me and looked at
me and looked at me and paused. And then he said, take the broom, sweep my
office, and go back to work. I don’t know if my youth moved him, if he had maybe a
daughter my age. But something moved him. I also am convinced that when I was
not taken in Plaszéw, it was because I was small and I was standing behind
somebody and they simply did not see me. Because there’s absolutely no reason
why I am here and my brother and others are dead. Th — I’m — I’m convince of it,

the room, but for just few seconds, we felt we had the most beautiful party dresses,

working in — in this ammunition company before the war. Not a Nazi. I knew that he
felt very sorry for me, he was a very kind man. Sometimes he brought a piece of
bread, sometimes an apple, and he hid it, and he told me where to find it. As I told

A: Last weeks before liberation, Leipzig, Buchenwald. My father was also in
Buchenwald.
Q: But you didn’t know it.
A: I didn’t know for a long time, but then one day some German — some Nazis came
and said that we are allowed to write a short card to Buchenwald men’s group. I
didn’t know if my father is dead or not, but I wrote. And my aunt wrote to her
husband, and I got an answer back. We could all write just I’m fine, Iam happy, you
know, and — and — just few words. I gave the letters to the museum. So I knew then
my father was in Buchenwald.
Q: And he was alive.
A: And he survived. Okay, it was at the end of March or beginning of April, 1945.
From newspaper clippings smuggled into the ammunition factory by a non-Jewish
Belgian friend, we knew that the situation did not look good for the Germans. One
evening, as we lay stretched on our plank beds, we heard sounds of shelling, gunfire
and explosions. We knew that these were the sounds of the American front being so

near. What sweet sounds they were. Our hopes for being soon free rose high.
Unfortunately, our euphoria was very short-lived. Around nine or 10 0’clock the
same evening, we were ordered to assemble outside on the assembly field. I don’t
remember if we were told for what purpose. We were given some supply of food,
and we were marched out of the camp into the darkness of the night. About 5,000
women began their new journey. A journey which became known as the death
march. We marched and marched. Days replaced nights. We kept marching, given
short periods of rest. We mar-marched in sunshine and we marched in the rain. We
marched through towns, and we marched through villages. No one knew where we
were going. Later we found out that we were walking between the American and the
Russian front. While we were marching, we were heavily guarded by our captors.
They were working in shifts. Replacements for them were coming on trucks. Food
was delivered to them, while our was long gone. The officers among our captors
were driving by in comfortable cars, enjoying the sight of marching subhuman
creatures. Their spotless starch uniforms were highly polish — and highly pol-
polished boots, must have been quite a contrast with the wrecks and filths we were
in. Iremember when others were given to rest, we turned the seams of our prisoners
striped clothes from inside out, and squashed as many lice as we could between our
fingernails. The itching was unbearable. By now some of the events are blurred.
Others are more deeply engraved in my memory. I still can see half faces of the

German civilian population, the other half hidden behind the curtain, watching as we
marched. What were they thinking? What did they feel? Once, taking a rest near
woods, we heard shots. We found out later that someone was shot trying to escape.
How could anyone hope to escape? Besides being so heavily guarded, we had only
our prisoner’s clothes on. How far could we go without being caught? So we kept
marching. We ate grass, and even this was forbidden, if a cruel guard chose to do so.
Days and nights went by. More and more people were unable to keep walking, and
each of us was too weak to be able to help someone else. We could hardly lift our
own feet. How dreadful and painful it was to have to leave someone dear behind to
die. We came up on a desolate concentration camp. There was no movement
anywhere. It was so eerie. Where were the people? Were they also marching, or
were they shipped into crematoria? When we still had strength to talk, we kept
evaluating our situation. One terrifying thought went through our minds. We were
fearful, and then when the Germans will realize that they have lost, they will shoot
us anyway. We imagined that they will need our uniforms to make an easier escape.
There was so little hope for our survival, one way or the other. How they do it, keep
marching. My most vivid memories are of a situation which occurred on a farmland.
Naturally, we were very hungry, and exhausted when others came to rest. Some
prisoner noticed in the distance of the field, a wagon loaded with potatoes, which
several farmers were about to plant. As soon as some of the women prisoner noticed

it, they began running to grab some potatoes. My Aunt Polly started to run. I
grabbed her with the little strength I had left, and pleaded with her not to go. Just
then rifle fire started blasting and that women were falling everywhere. A young
woman, she could have been between 18 - 20 years old, was shot in the leg. She
tried to get up, but couldn’t. She was not too far from us. What pain and terror were
reflected in her eyes. She screamed and pleaded for help. The Germans took their
time to kill her. We kept walking, leaving more and more people behind, often
stepping over them. As we grew weaker and could hardly walk with our eyes open,
letting ourselves to be pushed by the mass of people, my — my aunt and our small
group of friends around us tried to reassure ourself that one or the other are still with
us. From time to time we called each other’s names in weak voices, and our
responses brought some relief to the others. The rest periods were welcome, but it
was increasingly more difficult to get up, and to keep marching. Actually, for most
of us, it was impossible to get up, but as soon as a shot was fired into the helpless
prisoners, we collected our bit — last bits of energy and kept going. One day we
found ourself on another farmland. There was even food for us in kettles in a huge
barn. After eating and some rest, we were ordered once more to get up and to
continue to march. Only this time, some of us were no longer able to do so. We
reached our limits. We had to give up. We were told that if we will not vacate this
barn, it will be locked and burned with us in it. It seemed that our fate was sealed.

Some women were still able to get up and go. We found out later that they were
shot, and that that Nazis did use their uniforms. As for us in the barn, freedom came
in the last moment, and a Russian soldier on a motorcycle, leading the way to more
Russian soldiers on trucks appeared and prevented the burning of the barn, with our
living corpses in it. I have no recollection of what I felt at the time of our liberation.
I—I don’t remember if I fully comprehended that it was all over, and we were
finally and truly free.
Q: Did you have any opportunity to sleep on those marches, or during the nighttime
they kept you moving?
A: They kept us moving all the time, we must have slept, you know, whenever they
told us to rest, but — but it was more and more difficult to kept marching. We just
had less and less energy. We didn't eat for days.
Q: Do you know where you ended up, on that farm?

Erik didn’t survive. They were — they were devastated by it, you know? And so I

they survived and their loved ha — ones didn’t. I never felt that way, I never felt that
way. I always felt, I was a child and a young teenager. I haven’t done anything
wrong. My parents were wonderful people, it’s not that I should have died, they
should have lived.
Q: Yes. Exactly, exactly. By the age of 20 you had been through hell on earth, by
the time you went to Israel.
A: And then, when I speak, you know, college students, high school students say,
you must hate the Germans. I said, how could I? How? I have seen what hate can do.
How could I be part of? And forgive, I can forgive for myself, and I have done it. I
cannot forgive for — for the rest.
Q: Thank you Edith. Thank you very much for sharing —
A: Thank you.
Q: — your story today. I know that it’s cost something, and — and we really, really
appreciate it.
A: Thank you for doing it.

about my brother.
Q: Of course. He was a child. He was a child.
A: My mother ... and my father.
Q: Yes. I can’t imagine it, I can’t imagine it, what it must have felt to see his son
there, what it is — must have felt to be afraid for you. I can’t imagine it, even though
I’m a parent myself, when you’re not in that situation, yeah, it’s —
A: Yeah, you know, it happened so long ago. When I come here, and I entertain a
lot, I have lots of friends, when I go to the Giant and I buy, or anywhere and
[indecipherable] always the groceries, I think God, all I wanted was
[indecipherable] of potatoes, or a loaf of bread. All I wanted was just a little corner
where I know that nobody will come and drag me. You know, I have a nice
apartment, I have a wonderful family, and I have — I’m free. Oh, and when I — when
I walk, when I take a walk, it still comes back.
Q: Did you have nightmares?
A: I went through different stages. I had nightmares in the beginning, but it was
