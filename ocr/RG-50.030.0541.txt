Question: This is an interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino conducted by Ina
Navazelskis on Thursday, October 15", 2009 in Washington, D.C. First of all,
thank you very, very much, Lili, for agreeing to talk to us.
Answer: My pleasure.
Q: We know that this is not about the easiest of topics, and we’re very grateful that
you’ve agreed to share your story with us.
A: It’s fine, thank you.
Q: You’re welcome. Let’s start li— where we always start, and where they say in the
fairly tales, too, let’s start at the beginning.
A: Okay.
Q: Can you tell us a little bit about who you are as a child: when you were born, the
date you were born, the family you were born into, and we’ll take it from there.
A: Okay. I was born in 1938, June 2", 1938, in Iasi, Romania. And we all lived ina
courtyard, the whole family, cousins. I have a brother, his name is Morris, and my
mom and dad. And my dad was a tailor, but he was a designer, and we were quite
comfortably well off in Iasi. And I believe at the time that war broke out, which
was, I think I was four years old, and there was a lot of commotion out in the
backyard; meaning actually the front part of this courtyard where about four of our
family, different families lived; which grandparents usually just buy a house and

continue to build so the family can stay together. And this commotion started, and
my grandma —
Q: Can I stop right there? We’re still gonna talk about family at this moment, before
the war breaking out.
A: Okay.
Q: I'd like a few more details.
A: Okay.
Q: Is the — was this courtyard in the building where your family lived, was it in in
the middle of a town, li — in Iasi, or was it over to the side, was it a suburban area?
How would you describe that?
A: I would — the little bit of memory I have of it is, it was more on the side, it
definitely wasn’t in the main city. Iasi is a very small shtetl, which is like a little
town, and it was definitely in the farmer part, very rural. And my cousins, my
grandmother — my grandfather wasn’t alive when I was born, and my grandmother
lived in one of the houses, and I’m not sure if one of the cousins lived with her.
Then there were other cousins. And I— my memory serves me, we — there had to be
about four or five families. My —
Q: All related to you?

October 15, 2009
A: All related. And we lived in this courtyard that apparently, before my time, I
guess my grandparents built this, and just kept on expanding as people got married.
Q: But it wasn’t farming country, it wasn’t —
A: It wasn’t farming country.
Q: — farming country.
A: On the side there were farms, but we weren’t into farming. I believe my
grandfather, who I never had a chance to meet, was a fisherman. Very well-to-do
and very well acknowledged in the community, which my mother always told me he
had a great big monument that was dedicated to him. I never had the pleasure of
meeting him. We, I remember, lived in the front part, whether we were the last
family, or my mother was yul — the youngest to get married, and I think she was,
that’s where we lived, and my father, being a tailor, worked out of the house.
Q: So it sounds like — it sounds like you lived in either a small town or a village, but
in — inside the village, rather than i-in the ac — in a really rural are — areas. When
youw’re a tailor —
A: Oh, I would say inside, yes —
Q: Yeah.
A: Yes.

Q: When you’re a tailor, then you have clients that come on the main street, or a side
street, and they come with their — their — their —
A: But he wasn’t just a tailor my father, he really — some people use patterns, he
made his own pattern, and that’s — that’s another part of later on in the story. And he
actually designed women’s coats. So it was, you know, out of the house, and he had
a couple people working for him.
Q: So it’s like a dressmakers’ shop.
A: Exactly, not so much female — both, but mostly coats. Coats, jackets. And I
remember as young as I was, which I had to be about four years old, that’s when my
memory serves me, is | remember my grandmother took care of both my brother and
myself. My brother Morris is two years older than I am. And —
Q: That was one of my questions.
A: Yes, and my grandmother, who was well in her, I would say 80’s, who was more
like a mother, she really brought us up, because my mother worked with my dad,
and there were other workers; so they obviously were well off enough, cause there
was help. But we were taken care of by my grandmother.
Q: Do you remember your father in the shop at all, or do —
A: Oh, absolutely, I could —
Q: What kind of me — what kind of memories come to your mind?

A: About my father?
Q: About your parents, their working in the shop.
A: My mother was slim, pretty, fortunately did not, and later on in the story I'll
explain, did not look Jewish, which is what saved us. My dad —I resemble my dad
more than my mom — was just — I — in my eyes just a wonderful, kind, very gentle
with us. And he — he — they were busy, but my dad was never too busy to pay
attention, to myself especially, being the girl.
Q: Well, you were the little girl, yeah.
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the cousins I remember as young — going way back in my
memory, my favorite place at the time, from what I’m told, and I do remember is the
play — the house must have been up on stilts or something, because the kids played
underneath, in the dirt. And my cousins and I, that’s what I remember wa — we’re
going way back, and my mother and my dad and my brother reminded me that that’s
where we loved to play, in the mud underneath. And my cousins loved to throw
stones, and a couple of times actually cracked my head, and —
Q: And boy, did they get into trouble.
A: — being that Romanians are Gypsies, my mother had her theories about certain, I
guess holistic, or whatever. If you have a wound on your head, you get bread and

because that’s how it affected my brain.
Q: Well, did you — do you remember having a — you know, th-the bump on your
head , do you —
A: Oh yes, yes.
Q: Oh yeah?
A: And I reconnected this way back with my cousins who are the only ones who
survived in Israel, and reminded me that that’s what he did, and very happy about it.
Q: Yeah.
A: But that’s about where it — it stops, til war.
Q: And do — was this then your world, the world of the courtyard, your family —

or—
A: Yes, there —

and my dad was always busy with — the measuring tape was always around him, and
he always had a scissor in his hand — my neighbor — our neighbors were of — not of
the Jewish faith, because when things started, my mother — I don’t know if you want
me to go into that now, that’s — that’s the next part I remember is suddenly there was
a lot of commotion, and I don’t remember exactly how it happened, but I know we
had to put on — my grandma told me we have to put on this yellow band with the
Jewish star. And the neighbors next door, that part I remember, were just looking at
us. And I was young, and my — my mother didn’t look Jewish, and my father was
taken out with a lot of other men, and there were guns and things, and thi — all I
remember th — my grandmother taking my head, and hiding it in —
Q: In her stomach.
A: —her apron. And I remember my mother saying, and I remember hating her that,
don’t kill him, don’t shoot the Jew. I'll take care of the Jew in my own way. The
neighbors knew she was Jewish, but thank God they didn’t —
Q: Say anything.
A: —say anything. And this is one memory I really don’t want to remember, but the
next thing was, all of a sudden I peeked out from my grandmother, and there was
this woman yelling don’t, please don’t. And I remember she had a fat belly. And
they shot, something came out of her belly, and I remember a — it was a — a fetus.

thought well, it’s a matter of time where they’re gonna get my mother, they’re gonna
get my brother, they’re gonna get my grandmother. That’s all that I remember,

Q: Did you know the lady?

worst remembrance, and from there on, things just — I— I remember thinking, how
can my mother say she would — she will kill him herself, how could she do that?
And that’s about where it stopped. The only memory I have after that, we were
fairly well off, and I think there were even people who helped my mom clean the
house, and obviously my dad must have been doing all right, is suddenly, two

Q: — on the street —
A: —in their yard looking. There was like a fence, like a picket fence, and they were
looking at us, and my grandmother and my brother and I were like in a corner. My
mom was like right next to these — they were Germans. And she wasn’t wearing the
band, and I couldn’t understand why we were wearing the yellow band. And my
father was there and they took all the men, and it looked like some of them were —
they — they were fucking them with the gun. And I thought they’re gonna kill my
father. And I couldn’t understand how we were doing that, we were wearing the
band and all, and she wasn’t. And then she said what she did. From there on, I don’t

grandmother just took and put our heads in the apron so that we couldn’t hear
anything, she covered our ears, and I — it’s like everything blacked out from there.
There could never be a worse enemy or a worse thing I could ever see in my life
other than what I just saw there. That was the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen in my life,

we went back in the house and I didn’t — I re — I remember not seeing anything,
because my grandmother just totally —
Q: Do you have a feeling, when you looked at the neighbors on the — on the other
side of the picket fence, were they — did you have any sense of how they were
looking? Was it curiosity, was it horror, was it grief?
A: I-I-
Q: Were these people you knew well and liked, or were they distant?
A: I—I don’t really remember. All I do remember is they didn’t tell, because they
knew my mother was Jewish, and I think they were in awe, and I think it was a
combination of everything you just said. They were in shock, they were petrified.
They had to be. And knowing my mother was Jewish and denied it, and she wasn’t
wearing — fortunately they didn’t say anything, and obviously they were fond of her,

thing I’ve even seen in my life. I couldn’t believe a human being could do
something like that to another human being. But that was the beginning of many
horrors that I saw that I never should have seen, which is why I’m here. It — it never

A: I do remember going back in the house, but I don’t remember what was said.
There was a lot of mumbling among my mother and my — my — my grandmother,
who apparently — I don’t know if—I can’t even tell you if grandma was killed when
the bombs came, because shortly after that, I remember we were sleeping, and there
was like a—a-—a-— like a rubber thing li-like — like an earthquake. And I remember
— it still — it was a joke in the family that my mother said, what’s happening? My
father said, it’s tun(ph) pasheening(ph). In Romanian that means it’s a tank on
rubber wheels. And she said, no, no, it doesn’t sound like that, it sounds like, you
know — then we looked out and all of a sudden it was like Fourth of July, and it was
just — it wa — like firecrackers were going off. And I remember they tried to grab,
and it just happened so quick. They — my mother grabbed my brother and my father,
myself and we ran. And as we ran, it was in the courtyard, and like, the courtyard
was gone. It was just — bombs were — were falling all over, and I don’t know if—in
Europe the — the Russians wear these fur skwerta(ph), th-the fur coats. Somehow
or other she had that. Well, she — all I remember, we were running a — out of the
courtyard, and as we’re running, I guess the force of the bombs lifted me up because
I was th — to the point they had to drag me down and somehow or other we managed

bodies is all we had, and —
Q: So you made it out in the nick of time?
A: Apparently. All I remember is we stayed there, and as we ran there were bodies,
bodies all over the place. We just ran and ran and we stayed next to this wall. And
the bombs were going up. My mother kept on saying, pray to Grandma. So
apparently Grandma must have — I don’t know if she was alive or dead. And we ran,
and in running, my parents were saying don’t look, don’t look, but there were just
bodies all over the place. And we ran, and I do remember this, we ran to a hospital,
that’s the only other part I remember. And at that time, I don’t know I — if it was
Russians or what, but we — we were sitting on these benches type of thing against
the wall and wa — I—I-— all I remember is my father stood up to, I think it was a
Russian, they wanted the watches and the jewelry, and they’re women. And my
father was very upset. I remember I never saw him this upset, I remember I never
saw him this upset and this frightened. I can’t —I blacked out what happened after
that, but the part I do know, from that hospital, how we got out of there, I don’t
know. But after getting out of there we must have run all the way to Bucharest,

not sure, but I know we didn’t wear the yellow s — but then, it was put on again.
Q: Can I ask also, when you were in Bucharest, was it just the four of you, your
mother, father, brother and yourself, or was it part of the extended family, too?
A: There was a cousin there, and his name was Pompa(ph).
Q: Min-hm.
A: And I don’t — either they were there and we joined them, cause they couldn't have
been in the courtyard.
Q: Okay.
A: There was nothing in that courtyard left, that I remember.

Q: So the — some of the bodies could have been of your relatives.
A: Could have been. All I know is we ran on foot, and as young as I was, and it —
there was total blank. Everything — my other cousins — and it turned out they — some
did survive.
Q: Do you remember what time of year it was when all of that happened in the
courtyard?
A: It — it wasn’t — it had to be closer —- November. October, November, December,
because it was cold, it was cold.
Q: Okay.
A: And by the time we got to Bucharest, it was warm. It was warm. So we ran —
Q: So it was several months?
A: Oh, we ran, yeah. We — we hid in forests and I — I — all I — the part after the
bombing and the — the hospital is — I remember that. After that, I remember, it’s like
waking up and being in Bucharest. I know was warm because I remember all I had
was like a slip, and so it had to be warm. I just remember slight pictures. And I
remember my dad was working, he had a factory and he was working making clo —
coats and stuff. My mom worked with him. We were basically on our own, my
brother and myself, but that’s the way you were brought up, and we stayed within
the courtyard. And I remember my father saying he couldn’t do this. He’s making

coats for people who are killing and killed our relatives, and the other picture that I
do remember in Bucharest is my brother — my brother and I were going somewhere,
I don’t know where it was, a movie, or I don’t even know. He was to take care of
me, that was his responsibility.
Q: For a little boy.
A: No matter for — yeah, he was two years older, so whether I’m six now, I don’t
know. But I remember some street, and I know this was Bucharest, there was this
man who was like stretched out with a stick in his stomach and he was opened up,
and it said, this is what happens to Jews. And there were flies all over him. And my
brother took my face like don’t look, don’t look, and I remember thinking, I saw
something like this. [aside: No, no. Somebody wants to see?] I saw something like
this with the woman, and here was this ugly picture. That’s all I remember. That —
and somehow or other, back came the yellow bands, and from then on, all I
remember is running. War broke out, running. And my next memory is, we’re
somehow or other ca — we’re like in trenches, in — in these trenches, my mother and
my father and my brother. Somehow or other we got caught. Exactly how we got, I
don’t know, but then we were put, and we were well off and all, we were put in this
cattle type of boxcart, and they were — it seemed like a hundred people just — we
couldn’t breathe. It was dirty, it was th — and everybody was like — I don’t know,

here with these people? We don’t belong here. And people were crying, there were
babies crying, people were defecating and i— we were just mobbed together. And
we figured, you know, a lot of people were crying, saying we’re gonna be killed,
we’re gonna be killed. Everybody had the yellow star on their arms. And then, all of
a sudden the boxcar must have dis-attached, because we were moving fast, like the
train were just move — real fast. And suddenly, everything stood still, and we — you
couldn’t see out because there was a bok — there were no windows.
Q: So you were locked in this dark space —
A: We were locked in this dark space, and we had no idea what was in there except
a lot of people crying, yelling, what have you. My m — again, now I’m, my mother,
my brother, my father, and I don’t even remember where, it was just fear. And in my
mind I thought we were just going to go on a trip, but why all these people? Cause I
was so young. But then when it got dis-attached, when the boxcar became dis-
attached, everybody stopped, and you know, they couldn’t open the door, and the
men, somehow or other managed to open the door, and we saw the rest of the
boxcar, with probably more people, go on, and I was le — we were left on the track.
So the men, some ar —I gathered the men, the people in there opened it up, and

glue. And we ran and we ran and we got into — and this was cute, I was telling my
husband, we crossed — what they used to do is they used to take a wad of money and
wrap it around an explosive. When you’ve picked up the money the explosive goes
off, but being at the age that I was, we ran over — this I remember definitely — this
little bridge, and I saw there was a wad of money. And I went for it, and my
mother’s going no, no, no, no, no. She really thought I was gonna explode any
minute. Well it turned out it really was —
Q: A wad of money.
A: —a wad of money. And that wad of money crossed us — we were no — we ran by
foot, or from this boxcar, wherever we were — it took us. I remember it was in
Budapest. And we stayed in this very — it — it looked like a great big — I remember it
had a white picket fence, and it was like a colonial type of beautiful house. And this
is gonna sound very strange, it’s like in— I’ve been there before. And we were in the
cellar, and what you do is — these were, I think Jewish people who crossed you over
the border. They took your rings if you had no money. They took money, well I had
the money, and my mother had rings, or I guess she had jewelry she had hidden, I
have no idea. But I remember we were to leave, and my mother told my brother and

there’s such a thing as déja vu, this was — I knew exactly where I was. And I walked
around the block and I knew where I was, no one can tell me otherwise. I knew
where I was. And the man who was supposed to cross us over, not borders, to
another place, into the woods, and in the woods somebody else would meet us. And
if you have more money, you give them and take you to another destination, that I
remember. Well, they — my mother and father didn’t want to leave because I was
gone. Fortunately, I found — I knew where I was, I found my way back, got a heck of
a whack on my rear end, and we ran. And I was just telling my husband that the
woods were so thick, that now I — 1 — I’m amazed why there were no animals, but
that’s where we stayed, what — there was no food, we weren’t given food. You pay
the money to the person who takes you to that part of the woods and you hide there,

apparently we made our way all the way to another place, where somebody reported
us.
Q: In Hungary now.
A: In Hungary. And there, we’re put in jail. And for the first time — one minute —
first time my mother and I, and my brother and my father were separated. The men
had to go in one, it’s like a courtyard. I remember it had like a fountain in front, and
there were women and the women had babies, and they were trying to feed the
babies. People would — the women were defecating, and I never s — I would never
see my father or my brother again, so we figured this is it. We were caught. We got
this far, we’ll never survive again. But again luck was on our side, somehow or
other. The door — I don’t know if we were there a day, definitely overnight — they
pushed water and stale bread on — under the door. And if you got to it, you got to
eat, if you didn’t, fine. But somehow or other the door was left open, this one, was it
night or dusk, I don’t remember. I do remember my mother grabbing my hand, and
we ran, along with the other people. And we hid out, was like a farm, and there were

Q: Your mother’s mouth too, or just children’s?
A: The kids, the kids, and we were not to sneeze, cough, nothing. And the part that I
remember, which is almost comical, and I was thinking — and I didn’t know my
father and my brother were also let out. Somebody left the door open, I think it was
done deliberately. What happened is we were in hay, covered with hay, and I
remember my mother saying, not a word, don’t move. Whispering, don’t move,
don’t cough, don’t breathe, nothing. Well, all I can remember thinking is, I looked
down and I saw these gorgeous blue eyes. It was a German. It was a German man.
Blonde hair, these piercing blue eyes, and he had a pitchfork. And I’m thinking to
myself, if he’s going to take that and push it in, how is my mother gonna know that
I’m gonna be killed and I’m hurting. And I’m — I couldn’t imagine, how do I let her
know, how do I let my mother know that he’s gonna do that. He saw me. We made
eye contact, there’s no question about that. And I thought, this is it, he’s gonna do

tape off and the running started. Now we ran from —
Q: We — I— wa -— was your father and brother also in that hay?
A: Yeah, but we didn’t know that. We —
Q: So when you —

but I saw, and we had no time to acknowledge or hug, we all ran. And somehow or
other there was four of us. There probably were a lot more, but everybody ran. The
only thing I remember after that, and we were very lucky, I have no complaints, is
we again hid. There were nobody to cross the borders, whether we got — I think we
ran by foot, that becomes blank. I remember cold. All we had was — bathing, there
was no such thing. Food, I don’t know how and what my mother gave me, or even if
we ate. That wasn’t even important. Survival was the only important thing. And
again hiding, and being quiet. It was like I’ll never talk again. I’ll never see my
family again. It — it was just, this is my way of life, this is how I have to — we have
to live. And my brother wouldn’t even talk to me, he — there was no talking, it was
just surviving. Save your strength, survive. And we hid out, I believe, in fields. We

they would be punished. My father, the — my gentle father was the head of the
Russians, and I do remember this and to this day I will not sleep with my back to a
door, is I happened to peek out and I saw this man walking on the ledge up a— and I
was the only one, I saw his face, but we never — anyway, they caught him. My father
had to punish him to show the rest. Children, everybody had to watch. And I
thought, he can’t do this. I remember he took the man’s hand and put it in the door
and crushed his fingers. And that was so unlike him, he was not a es — he was not a
bad man, but I thought, my father, look what it’s done to him. He actually hurt this
man, and the — the — the screaming that he broke his fingers.
Q: Was he there to steal, was that what they was doing?
A: He was watch — walking along the ledge, and, like there, and looking to where —
and I guess he stole some stuff. To this day I ne — I would — I —I saw his face, he —
he must have seen me, and I put the blanket over my head, that’s just another
memory of mine. And I — I — he — he was found out, I don’t know how, they found
the stuff on him. But I remember thinking I could never love my father like I used
to. How could he do this to another human being? So I was convinced this — it did
change my father, it did change my mother. And from there on, the quota — oh I, we
almost — the quota opened up, we couldn’t go to Israel because the British wouldn’t
allow us in, and he was just a tailor. They took the doctors, the lawyers to the U.S.

chance we could go and — not to the U.S., but Canada. And there were — there was
no penicillin and if it was infected, and I remember my mother trying to hide, cause
it was in the bone, it was right in the knee. How we found out, my brother says, why
is the grass around you red? And then when I stood up, my whole leg on my left
knee was cut. And instead of — I didn't understand what was happening to my

they’re not gonna allow my parents to get out of there because of me and I — what do

how awful that was, because it’s the only place that — the Jewish Federation gave us
clothing, and I said — I—I found out I — gave us clothing, gave us shelter. We ended
up staying th-the — the front of the house was where they — they killed the chickens,
kosher chickens and there was blood, and I thought, oh God. And it was a Jewish
school, and I remember it — I forgot their names. It was an older lady and a
wonderful couple. And all they could offer us was during the day — it was a Hebrew
school — we could sleep there at night, but we had to vacate, and all they could offer
was the floor. We were grateful, and that I remember, the four of us slept on the
floor at this Hebrew school at night, but during the day we had to vacate it. And I

A: How I changed? My parents changed, because I remember my mother — my

because there was always money there. And suddenly — now that you bring that up,
the only job they — we had to pay back Jewish Federation, and I remember hearing
my mother saying — you know, I know now that all these donations that we give to
the Jewish Federation, maybe it’s different now, and they worked — they were able
to work in the delicatessen store. My father never did cold cuts, ne —- my mother
never really worked, other than tailoring. And oh how he hated it. It was not his
trade. And then it actually became comical, because the little bit they made, half of
his salary, say if he got 10 dollars, five had to go back to the Jewish Federation. We
know for a fact the clothes were donations. And I’m not putting down the Jewish fe
— but every single paycheck, they had to pay back. And we wore hand-me-down

responsibility — death would have gotten to him unless he to — his job was to take
care of me. And he did as best as I could, but I remember getting into fights, which
was not my nature. But the kids, I guess, were making fun of — I couldn’t — I could
speak all these other languages, and the teacher, of course, all loved me. Couldn’t be

jumped on her, oh, I — I wa — i-it wa — just wasn’t — the anger came out of me like an
animal, and I remember my brother peeling me off of this girl. And I remember
going to the principal’s office, or somebody. And they — I couldn’t speak to them, I
couldn’t tell them. And, the [indecipherable] came down, and he said, why did you
do it? And I remember yelling, I’m Jewish, I’m Jewish. And that’s the only part I
remember is, I’m Jewish. But the girl didn’t do it because I was Jewish, but I
couldn’t understand why she was picking on me, and making fun and laughing. So
the answer, it did, it hardened me. And even though my brother was to look after
me, I realized that it’s time to look after myself, this is going to happen. And I’Il just
have to fill my own shoes, because he’s two years older, he’s now in another grade,
and this is life. This is life, and we’re very lucky, and you know, I can’t be his

I had a brain because it start — they didn’t know where to put me. They started off
with first grade, and then | think the last was third grade. And then fourth — by
fourth grade, I remember by then I was speaking English, made my friends, gave my
brother a breathing room where he could go with his friends. But it made me bitter.
Bitter, not — definitely bitter against the Germans, which, they weren’t — it made me
very — to this day I have no love, and you can’t blame the whole, and I mean, I hate
the language. And ironically enough, even as I got a job in public health nursing and
put myself through school, I used the German lan — I had to use the German
language to be in a clinic, to interpret to German refugees in Toronto, Canada, of
what to do with their babies. And a couple of times, I literally messed up, and I
knew I messed up, and I didn’t even, God forgive me, resent it. I really didn't — I
didn't feel bad about — not that I told her the wrong thing, I just said to her, in— in
German, can’t understand, na — na [German] fa — you know, mixing Jewish with —
and they — it’s like I—I guess my best way of inter — I mixed the ger — Jewish with
the German deliberately. I wanted them to know I’m a Jew, and I’m helping you
speak this language for your baby. What did you do for us? That’s where I was
wrong. But that’s — I—I can actually say from there on, I feel very fortunate.

she had fallen downstairs. Ge — what’s — what was this episode?
A: That must have happened either after I was born — all I know is the Holocaust, or
the Germans were paying for the people that went through the Holocaust, and it was
making retribution.
Q: Retri — reparations.
A: Right. And there were paintings and stuff, and what have you, which were either
burnt, we had no idea. As I remember, her being interviewed, this is in Canada, to

us, with the running, the house was destroyed — excuse me — and she got some kind
of, I guess, pension. Not for long, but she is — she was eligible, but I couldn’t
understand — then, we were told, both my brother and I, that we too. And this is my
second marriage. And I did marry a Jewish gentleman who I met my first time, first
year out of nursing school, anyway, and was married to a Jewish man for 20 —
almost 28 years, had my three beautiful daughters. And at the time I was living in
Connecticut, and my brother — my mother and father moved to be with me, cause
they weren’t getting along with my sister-in-law, but it doesn’t matter, they wanted
to be close. And that was fine, we brought them over. And she was getting some
money wa — and I remember my brother said, you know, you gonna go. And my
husband said, go. And I says well, I'll give them a call. And I think I spoke to
someone on the phone, if I remember correctly. This — we’re going back, I would
have been married 50 years. And they said, you have to speak German and you have
to go through all this. And I said, you know what? There’s no money you can give
me to bring back these memories, I don’t want to go through it, not then. And my

want to remember it, I don’t even want to talk about it. Cause she did call him, and —
Q: And so he’s never given his testimony to anybody?
A: No, and he doesn’t want to. And he probably remembers more than me, but he —
he wants to forget it, he says, I don’t want to remember it. And I — I didn’t want to
push it because I saw him welling up. And I’m not — the reason I’m doing is, I have
that gentleman, my husband to thank, cause I had these few pictures, and I do have
more at home, and I was treasuring them. And, ironically enough, to end the story,
my husband said to me, look, the pictures are gonna just crumble up and they’re
gonna get lost. Have them, you know, put them in the Holocaust, and you know. So
I did, and I’m glad I did, because ironically enough, then a letter came, and I wrote
my little story, and my granddaughter, which I’m very proud to say, and that’s the
reason I’m here, says, Grandma, can I use your paper and talk about your experience
in that — the Holocaust? And I said absolutely, and she used that and got an A plus in
her — and then I went to speak to 90 — 90 kids, three classes of sixth graders, and my
two grandchildren were there, all big-eyed, looking at me, proud as punch, and I
thought, there is a reason. And I really thank my husband for this, because the story
has to be told, it did happen, and the kids should know. My — my grandson, who
lives in Florida will be here December — no, April, he was chosen, he’s very gifted.

Q: Yeah, when you first arrived. Did he — what happened with them, and did they
ever change back to the parents you originally knew?
A: No, no. My — my father and mother worked in the delicatessen til — they hated it,
but it was the only way — the only job. Eventually, he went back to his tailoring, and
my mother worked too, and that was one thing that bothered my dad, because she
only worked with him, and was able to go back into the tailoring and worked there
and made a nice living at it. And after years of slowly, after all these moves, they
bought a house —
Q: In Toronto.
A: —and — in Toronto, Canada, and it was on Essex Street, and that’s where I
became a person. We had a house. We did rent the upstairs, we didn’t have a—a
penny, but I actually — I went to grammar school during the day, made sure my
grades were done. It — it was different in my time, that I told the kids. I had school to
do, nobody cared whether I went to school, got As, Bs or Fs. My job, unlike my
brother now, the story reversed, I was to cook, I was to clean. He was a boy, he
could do whatever. So I went to elementary school there, Essex, and had a job, I
think I was 11, and worked with my girlfriend Marcy’s father’s store after school.
Went to work there, but before I could do that, I had to clean and do whatever, cook.
My mother bought me a little stool and I could mix the soup and what have you.

And that was my responsibility, so the shoe reversed, my brother had the freedom,
but I became the housekeeper. And I kept my grades up, my teachers were
wonderful. Learning was a wonderful thing for me, and working made me
independent, and bought my own bicycle, made friends and my father and mother
stayed in Canada and we lived there. Then we upgraded.
Q: Was it a warm family, even though they had changed?
A: No, the marriage, no. They argued a lot, and was mostly money. It was not the
same people that I remembered, but I just figured the hardship — there was arguing,
arguing and it was mostly money. And we supposedly moved up to Shepherd
Avenue because of me, so that th — you know, I would meet better people and get
married, because at 16 they were convinced I was gonna be an old maid. And as it
turned out, at 18, I was married.

didn’t really want to do this, I— I think she was — my mother was a bright woman,

she loved business. And my father was more the caretaker. That’s the best way I can
describe it. And I was close, he was a wonderful man, I loved him deeply. Ended up
with Alzheimer’s and could never be separated from my mother, he just adored her.
And the saddest day, probably almost as sad as the Holocaust, is have to slowly take
his license away, and then put him in a home. Only because what was happening is
he would wander off. And I — now I’m — I was separated from my husband, things
were tough. But my parents were my upkeep, and it got to the point where a
wonderful visiting nurse says, you can’t keep doing this, cause I had three kids to
take care of, and my parents. And the kids were easier to take care of than my
parents. But it was difficult, because I think all of this took a toll on him. And the

Mom had to go there too, because you couldn’t separate them. And I watched him

because — I’Il add one thing, my mom didn’t care what — the grades or what have
you, but that was because she — her mother had her at 50. It’s a gap, so her mother

Q: Your grandfather.
A: —I think I’ve only seen twice, as young as I was. And I know the whole farm was
big, and I remember him milking the cow and bringing it to me warm, out of — right
out of the cow. But when the war broke out, either they were killed — I know my
father’s sister, very tragically, there was a movie that was called, the brievela(ph) de
Mama. You understand what that means? Letter to your mother?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And apparently, some fire broke out, and she was trampled to death. And her
name was Anutsa(ph). And my father told me this. It was just before, I guess, war
first broke out. And that was tragic. Beyond that, I never really knew. I was too
young. What happened to them, I don’t know. His sister was alive in Israel, made it,
but when war broke out, every — everybody just flew in different direction.
Q: Another question. How did you choose your profession? Where did you —
A: Oh, I had a few.
Q: Yeah, then — you mentioned the nursing.
A: Supposed to go to nursing school, but it didn’t work out, because I couldn’t stand
anything being blood. And I was very good with my hands, and very athletic, as my
mother was. She used to call herself a Maccabee, which she was in. I — I actually

worked for public health nurses. And —
Q: Okay. That would have been in Canada.
A: That would have been in Canada. And I did volunteer work at a veteran’s
hospital up to the age that I got married. From about 15, myself and my friends
would go every Sunday and cook for the veterans. And I remember writing, they
were parachuters, and all that remained of them was just their bodies, they were like
in — I don’t know what you call those swings, you know, it’s just the netting, it’s like
Q: Yeah.
A: And I remember they couldn’t write. And I would write letters to their
sweethearts, nobody came to visit them. They gave me tremendous — myself and my
friends, but I loved that. We — I — I loved doing that.
Q: It was meaning.
A: It w—it—I don’t—I can’t —I mean, at 16 you don’t do things like that. There
were five of us, who we just stel — reunited in Toronto, Canada, and that’s what we
did every Sunday. And it’s — that — that was very fulfilling. That’s the only way I
can describe it, very fulfilling, and back to your question as far — then I got married,

excellent typist, so the thing to do was transcribe. And I applied to Manpower or
something, and my typing was excellent. And ended up doing typing. And then my
languages opened up doors again. My children were born and then I stopped
working, and my husband was in the printing business. And because of my
languages, a friend called and says, Lili, you know how speak Yiddish fluently, and
German and a little bit of Russian and Polish. There’s a job opening at the Jewish
center for the hot lunch program that consists of like 150 people. You have to do
programming, it’s quite involved. I said, I don’t know, because my husband didn’t
want me to work. Went down, I applied, got the job, was able to take — I was not
allowed to work unless I brought — til my kids were in school, home for the kids
after school, those were the rules. And that was fine. So I brought my little one,
which is my youngest, Stacey with me, and I remember loving work, just loving it.
Prior to that — oh, after that, I remember — I thought, okay, I did that, she came with
me. Now it’s time to put her in a daycare and I will put her in a daycare and get
myself a job. The other two were in school, and I'll work around the kids. And
ironically enough, I went to sign her up, and I was sitting on the floor, reading her a
book til I could get the director. And I had three or four kids on my lap, a couple on
my back, and I’m reading these books and these kids are all over me, and I think,
what the heck? And she says to me, would you — well, what’d you come here for?

And I says, to sign up my daughter. And she says, well, I’ve got a better idea. You
come work for us. You see? So I ended up having a full time job, my daughter got in
free, and I started to work for the daycare. After that, I just loved working, and I end
— from there, I went to work for special ed, as an aide. And because of my grades
and what have you, I found myself working one on one, and I absolutely loved it.
And I would go to different schools, and there was one, you know, some kids were
wheelchair bound, couldn’t talk, one was sign language. And I would work one on
one — one on one with them. That was another job. After that it was a multitude of
incredible jobs, I don’t know how I got them. Dad had to go, because now the kids
were all in school, and I thought, well, it’s time to go on. I believe, if I’m not
mistaken, I worked for a bank. And that was again up to three o’clock, and be home
for the kids. From the bank, I thought, well, let’s see what else I can do, I love
people. I went to work for, happened to be two Jewish ladies, physical therapy. I
was a wer — answered the phone. It’s — and I ended up giving physical therapy,
which I didn’t want to do, but she says, you’ve got some nursing background. I
ended up doing physical therapy, which I shouldn’t have done. And then, next thing
I know is this friend of theirs wanted to open up this thing, adaptive clothing for the
handicapped. And she had — that’s when Velcro first came in.

A: And she said, what do you think, Lili? So the one who owned the physical, she
says, I want you to meet this woman who came in, I think it was either Las Vegas,
or I-I’m not even sure where she lived, califor — someplace. She was a wonderful
lady, we hit it off immediately. And she says, will you work with me on this, and
we’ll — somehow or other I got involved with her, and we opened up this thing. But,
my husband decided it’s — it — that’s enough. It was every eat — when I worked for
the Jewish Center, I was in the paper, because I was talking to governors and mayors
and what have you. Whether that threatened him, I don’t know, and I was in the
paper, and then when I ope — started with this adaptive clothing for the handicapped,
again it was, you know, ribbon cutting, and that did it, it was just— ’'m—T’m
exposed, and there’s just too much. So then, I think there was another job I was
applying to, and that was — there were — I loved physical fitness and people, so I
applied at, I remember, the YMCA in Hamden, Connecticut. And I thought,
there’s no way I’m gonna get it, I mean, this is director for — and he says, I’m very
interested. And I came home to tell my husband that I’m going to possibly — you
know, I — I interviewed and there’s a good chance, that was the end of my married
life, and what have you, and he says, no you’re not, you’re coming to work at Brody
Printing Company. If you’re so great, you can prove it to me. And that was a bad
move, because I found the things — this was not the man I was married to, and

working for him was not the things to do because the way he talked to people and
handled people is the way he hated other people handling him, not to get involved.
And the marriage fell apart. And you ready? I was there with well, not three,
because my daughter moved out, my oldest daughter, and she went to college, and
so did the middle one. And the marriage — we went to Israel, my treat. The only way
the kids went on vacation is if I paid for it. And this was a wealthy man, who really
didn’t like kids, but he wasn’t a bad father, he just wasn’t around, so I was basically
a single mom anyway. The reason I’m saying this, and there is where the Holocaust,
and my experience is making me what I am, I’m grateful for. What does a woman
do with no credit cards, two children, three to take care of, had a beautiful home,
went on vacations, now I’m alone, because the silence was deafening, the
relationship fell apart, and I kept on saying — you know, I — I—I—I go on vacations,
I have a beautiful home, three beautiful children, what’s going on, why am I
unhappy? There was no conversation, it was — everything fell apart. There was no
interaction, and I was going into depression and I ended up div — taking the family,
the last hurrah, to Israel, where I met the cousin who split my head. And there were,
I think, 12 of us at a table, and because my husband was well off at the time — and I
treated, with 7,000 dollars for that trip, and the best trip ever. And we got — the kids
got to see Israel. I met my — the family that was left over. And that — that was it,

1985, I went on my own. When we came back, the marriage was over, unbeknownst
to me, there was somebody else for 15 years.
Q: Oh my.
A: That was — and back in the thing, I had to now, no credit cards, no car. What am I
gonna do? Sold the house, which was mine, and went to school, and learned how to
be a court reporter. I worked in the court system.

Holocaust for making me the strong woman.
