Question: Good morning Harry. It’s nice to have you here. Tell me what your name was
at your birth.
Answer: Harry Iticovici.
Q: Iticovici, or iti —
A: No, let me tell you about this.
Q: Yes.
A: My father names was Ithzeekovitch(ph). Ithzeekovitch(ph). The letter in Romanian,
a T with a little comma under it, aC. And when they asked me my name, I forgot about
the little comma, so that’s why I said Iticovicz(ph). But it was Ithzeekovitch(ph).
Q: Ithzeekovitch(ph).
A: See, Ithzik(ph), it’s a Jewish name from Isaac. And there are people in Israel now by
the name — with the name of Ithzik(ph), Ithzik(ph).
Q: Now di-— did you, many years later, did you take your father’s first name as your
middle name?
A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. When I became a citizen here, when I naturalized here, I took my
father’s middle name because I had no middle name and everybody was asking me about
the middle name.
Q: I see. So you thought you should have one?
A: Yeah.

Interview with Harry Iticovici °
August 24, 2010
A: Well, we were privileged, I think. I was privileged in many ways because the time of
the Romania was, after first World War, and the economic situation was good, and my
father business was good, so I didn’t have to work. So th-the only thing I had to do is to
go to school.
Q: And what sort of a — did you live in an apartment, did you live in a house?
A: No, we only lived in an apartment.
Q: Uh-huh. A-An apartment that your parents owned, or that they just rented?
A: No, rented.
Q: Was it a big one? Did you have your own room, for instance?
A: When I was an adolescent, yes. That’s another one, we had the — I had the — my own
room where I could study, you see. There was a lot of studying in the high school in
Romania that time. And of course we had to learn lots of foreign languages. We learned
French in school, then the Italian in school, and then privately I learned English.
Q: And why did you privately learn English? Why was — did your parents think this was
an important thing to do?
A: Well, because if — the idea was — part of it was that when you — in Romania, if you
leave there, and you are a s-specialist, either you are an engineer or an architect, or a
doctor, you have to travel. So if you have to travel, you have to know languages.
Q: So did you become fluent in French and Italian —

Interview with Harry Iticovici °
August 24, 2010
A: Now —
Q: Yeah?
A: In French I had to become fluent, because there was an exam in French. You see, th —
we have the — they had the high school in Romania is like in France, you have to pass
the baccalaureate, you know. And there is an exam in French, and the French teacher is
talking you in French. But th-the — talks about literature, and what else? And so I — I took
some lesson in conversation in French.
Q: And what about your Italian, was there an exam in Italian?
A: Italian, no, no, there was no examination in Italian, you know, just is a — I didn’t want
to take German. Most students took Germans, but I —I didn’t like the German.
Q: And how come?
A: Because of Hitler.
Q: I see, so you were very conscious —
A: Oh yes.
Q: — once you became a — a—
A: Oh yeah, we were very conscious when I was in high school. Let me say this about
this. In Romania, there were at least two political party that was very — that were very
anti-Semitic. And when you were growing up in high school, and reading the newspaper,
you were aware that there was a certain amount of anti-Semitism all the time.

Q: Mm-hm. Wer — did you have non-Jewish friends as well as Jewish friends in — in high
school, or was this mainly a Jewish school?
A: No, I went to high school, a state high school, which was in — more or less in the
Jewish district of town. And ma — ther — about half of the class was Jewish, half of the
class was not Jewish. But we had Jewish friends. I had Jewish friends.

August 24, 2010
Q: To [indecipherable]
A: — high holidays, no, no.
Q: So you didn’t go to synagogue growing up?
A: I had a Bar Mitzvah.
Q: You did? Did that seem odd to you, given that your parents were not very religious, or
did that seem —
A: Well, let me say this about it. According to the Romanian constitution, in high school
— you see, the high school was not like here, everybody goes to the high school. You had
to take an exam to get in the high school, it wasn’t compulsory high school. And
according to the constitution, every student had to have religious education. There was a
mark for religious education, you had to be in the class. And I took Jewish religion in the
high school. We had the rabbi who came in and talked to us.
Q: So were you required to — to be the religion of your parents, or could you have
decided to go to another class altogether?
A: No, no, you —
Q: You had to do it.
A: You have to do a religion. Of course, I was Jewish, so I — so I-I — I went to the — to the
special classes, the rabbi who came in.
Q: Right, right.

A: And then the rabbi was involved with the — I think it was — not an Orthodox, Reform —
Q: The Reform movement.
A: — Reform synagogue, and then I took the Bar Mitzvah in the Reform synagogue.
Q: I see. But the Bar Mitzvah was not required, right?
A: No, no, it was not required.
Q: No, you — did you decide you wanted to do it, or did your parents decide, do you
think?
A: No. I don’t know, everybody was doing it, so I did it.
Q: So you did it. Was there a party?
A: No party.
Q: No party, you just did the Bar Mitzvah.
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you like it? Did y — was — were you —

Q: Uh-huh. In Hebrew?
A: In Hebrew.
Q: Ah. And who translated it for you? Did you — did you write it in Romanian?
A: Oh no, no, I took Hebrew lessons.
Q: Oh, so you could do it.
A: Yeah. Not only that, but during the Bar Mitzvah, we were four students, and you had
to go to the Torah and I think that we read a little of the Torah aloud.
Q: I see. Right.
A: So you had to learn the — how to read the script.
Q: The script from that Torah, right.
A: Yeah.
Q: So what kind of a child were you? Were you very serious? Were you a problem for
your parents, what were — look at that look on your face.
A: I—I don’t know. I think that the influence of my mother was that — you see, my
parents didn’t have an education. So I had to have an education and I had to be what they
used to call the liberal profession. Which mean either a lawyer or a doctor or an engineer
or something, you know. And there was a certain pressure to become a —
Q: A professional.
A: A professional, right.

Q: Were — did you resent it?
A: No.
Q: No, you didn’t. This was okay with you.

A: Well, when he became older, we already had the problem with — with the Jews and he
couldn’t go to the regular state school. And he had to go to a Jewish school. And —
Q: This is even before high school, yeah.
A: No, in high school.
Q: In high school.
A: In high school.
Q: I see.
A: He couldn’t go to the regular school, the ji— state school. You see, i-it was very
important to go to state school, to be able to pass that — the examination, the
baccalaureate, because that gives you rights to go to university and become an officer in
the army and so on. The baccalaureate was very important in the — in the — with the —
with the numerous [indecipherable] you know, and they started saying that the Jews
cannot go to the state school, so the Jews formed their own high schools. Now, I
understand from Radu that later on they recognized those schools, you see, after the war,
you see, in the — they went back — my brother went back to the regular state school.
Q: I see. But that was after the war.
A: After the war, yes.
Q: So, in 1933, when Hitler takes over, you’re 11 years old, are you very conscious that
— that — I mean, is there an affect in Romania at this time?

August 24, 2010
A: A li—a little — as I said again, there were all the time, I was very conscious that there
was a certain amount of anti-Semitism in the — in the - Romania, you know?
Q: So you grew up with that?
A: Oh yes, no question about it.
Q: Did you join Jewish — any Jewish groups at the time?
A: I—I was — only for a short time when we — we used to play basketball and volleyball —
well, that was later on, I was member of the Maccabee, that was a sports group, Jewish
sports group.
Q: So you didn’t join a Zionist political party or anything —
A: No.
Q: — or a group.
A: Now I[ had friends, my friends that I used to play soccer in the street when I was
young, later on they joined the Betar, and they were on Struma.
Q: Uh-huh. And they were killed.

Interview with Harry Iticovici “
August 24, 2010
Q: Right. And — and by then there — there is a clear Nazi influence in Romania, is that
right?
A: Well, it started — this is probably — you see, there was a lot of resentment in Romania
in the — because Poland was divided in 1939, you know. And the western powers didn’t
interfere. And the king felt that he cannot rely on the western power, so he made the
compromise and let the Germans come in. And he also made another compromise,
because he appointed the government wi-with these anti-Semitic groups. And the — the
influence of Germans, and the influence of the government, they started this that the Jews
cannot have business, the Jews cannot go to universities, and so on and so forth.
Q: Wa-Was there also some law against citizenship for Jews?
A: That’s right.
Q: So did you lose your citizenship?
A: Now, no.
Q: No, okay.
A: Now let me tell you about this. There were a number of laws in Romania that allowed
the Jews to become citizens. In the — my father was a soldier in the World War I, and he
got a citizenship because of that. But then they — they withdrew it, or they review it or
something and he had to go to court again to get it back.
Q: And did he get it back?

A: I think so, yes.
Q: So did that make you safer?
A: No.
Q: It didn’t.
A: No, because when they introduce this [indecipherable] and it seems that you could
not be — have a business on your name, or you cannot go to state run school, or you
cannot go to universities. Was a matter of religion, not of — of citizenship. See —
Q: I see.
A: — because you see, when the things got bad, everybody got the passport, you see, and a
—and wher — I got — I had a Romanian passport, my parents, especially my father, didn’t
want to leave.
Q: Oh, he didn’t?
A: No. He was not a [indecipherable] and he was in the war in Romania and he felt that
his place is to stay in Romania.
Q: But he couldn’t have his business any more, is that correct, or not?
A: He —I don’t remember what happened with that. Most Jews in business, what they
did, they had the nom de plume, you know what I mean? Just a Christian guy name, and
they were running the business, see?

Were you — were you, before you left, in some sort of a camp?
A: Oh yes.
Q: During — was this during the day, or you were sleeping there as well?
A: No, I was during the day in a big camp called [indecipherable]. Was a camp with
thousands of Jewish adolescents, and we were building some target — you know, mounds
of earth on both sides, so that the soldier can shoot targets, you see. And there is no
equipment to bring the earth up to make this [indecipherable] you see.
Q: So you were digging.
A: So you had two guys, a different level, moving earth. There was a tool — I don’t know
what you call that in English, I don’t know what you call it in eng —

Q: Right. So let me — when — did you make the decision by yourself to leave, or did you

I went to the meetings where they were organizing the trip.

in Romania there was a very strong French influence, you see, and — and you — actually,
in the — I was supposed to go on summer vacation to one of those summer courses in — in
France you see, but was cancelled because of the war, and you couldn’t go there. The
only other place you could go was Switzerland, and the problem was with Switzerland
was that you had to deposit money in advance that you are going to have enough money
to finish your school. So, we didn’t do that.

you wanted to leave?

going to go in trouble.

something — cause th-the German —
A: No, no, I— I—I would — I — he wasn’t — in those days you are — you see, there was
also something else that happened in Romania. When Antonescu became pri — pri —
premier, he — and the king left, you see, there was — he brought in the Iron Guards, which
was an extremely radical group who was also anti-Semitic. And there were stories of the
Iron Guards going in homes and picking up people in the streets and so on and so forth,

August 24, 2010
Q: Cause she was worried.
A: Oh yeah.
Q: Yes. So what — what were these meetings like, that you — when you went to these
meetings?
A: Well, these meetings were primarily — my understanding about this was that these
people, there were originally I think 10 or 11 or something, they decided to buy a boat
from a Greek person who built this boat as a sailboat for races — racing. This was a racing
sailboat. And I think he was in importing and export of grain, th-the Greek guy. And they
decided, th-that they are going to — to buy it, and so they were organizing the — they were
talking, where are we going to get the maps, the boat head, a small engine. One of the
guys was supposed to be a knowledge of mechanic, and he was supposed to take care of
the engine. And then where are we go — th-the — what kind of luggage we can take, you
know, we’re not supposed to take luggage because there was no place, just socks, you
see. And then there was a lot of talk about, if we leave in the winter or spring, the rail —
you see, this boat — and this is why we had trouble with, had a big mast with sails. And to
keep the mast up you have to have a keel under — under the boat. And the question was,
how are you going to use the sail if in the winter when the rail where the sail goes up and
down like a zipper is going to freeze, you see? So they were talking about all these
things, you see?

Q: So all of these things, in-including the life even before the influence of the Nazis, and

A: Well, you see, it was a combination of the Romanian government, be-because they a —
they accepted the German [indecipherable] without fighting, and these anti-Semitic
groups like the Legionnaires, that they adopted the German policies against the Jews.

little dinghy boat, and he went to the Chios Island. Those islands —
Q: Right.
A: — were occupied by the Germans, they were Greek islands, you know? And I think
that one of the thing that he was supposed to do, because of the keel, was to throw in a
gadget that it’s like a string with a weight, by which, before the boat goes in the harbor,
he finds out the depths of the water. And we d — he wasn’t there to do that any more. I
think that’s what he was doing —
Q: I see.
A: — before. And the captain should have asked one of the guys to do that, you see. And
what happened is that the keel, which was about three or — feet or four feet deep, went
between rocks in the por — Cesme, and then the boat started shaking like this, and
everybody got scared and we left the boat and we went on the Turkish coast. And then we
stayed there for, oh, I don’t know, maybe 10 hours or something like this. And then there
was a Turkish boat that rescue it. I mean, they were — they had some long sticks and
pushing the sticks to the bottom and at the same time the boat, pulling it, you know? So
they got it out from the ro — between the rocks and inflated it, and put it back on the
water, you know [indecipherable] water. Then we went back on the boat.

A: Well, I wrote them that I want to go to medical school, and they have a medical school
with very few students, you know, like 40 students a year or something like this. And
they wrote me that I — because of my — the baccalaureate exam, you know, that I’ll be
admitted to sophomore science. So I stayed there and took sophomore science. And then I
went to junior, and in junior you have to take a major, major in biology and a minor in
chemistry to be able to go to medical school.

course in the junior year. You know now, it depends, nowadays they give them
sometimes in medical school, you know, first year. But this teacher was, I think, from

A: In January 19 — sometimes in January 1948, the president of the university called the
Jewish students in his office. There were seven Jewish students, and told them that he
cannot guarantee their safety in the school, and that we should leave. Now, he gave us a
piece of paper, which is in the file of the museum, you know, where he said that the
[indecipherable] government requested the school to get rid of the foreign Jewish
students. Not the Jewish students from Arab countries, but s — the foreign Jewish
students. And — but he told us about the safety. Now, what happened was that when this
happened, most of the Jews that we had in school came from Palestine, and so they went
back to Palestine.
Q: Uh-huh. So y — when the war ends in 1945, did you think about going back to
Romania, or you didn’t?
A: PI tell you about that. The — I had, of course, problem with money [indecipherable].
And they couldn’t help me from — my family couldn’t help me. My father wanted me to
go back to Romania: he — he wrote me a letter. And I didn’t want to go back in
Romania.
Q: And did your mother write to you also, or not?
A: My mother was saying always, live your own life, you know. Do whatever you —
don’t worry about us, and so on and so forth, you see? But when this thing happened with
the meeting with the president of the American University of Beirut. Now, you have to

the doctor, the wife. He was a doctor in business or something, you know, he wasn’t a

Q: — to Johns Hopkins, did Johns Hopkins have a division in Utah? Is that why you
went to Utah, or —
A: No.
Q: No.
A: Tell you the relation. You see, the — the people from — one of the people from teaching
neuro-anatomy in — in Beirut, which I think he was from John Hopkins, I did some
translations for him from Italian to English. Some research — he was interested in the
pituitary gland, and I did some resear — some translations for him, and I think maybe —
maybe he was the guy who wrote the letters, I don’t know who wrote the letters. But the
way this happen is that one of the John Hopkins professor, by the name of Maxwell
Winthrop — he was a hematologist, you know, at John Hopkins, became chairman of
the department of medicine in Utah. Now why — how that happened was that Utah
before the war had a two year medical school. And then after two years, they had to go
usually to Chicago to finish medical school. Now, because of the war, they decided to
make a four year medical school, and then they had to get chairmen — you know,
professors. And they got this, the Maxwell Winthrop from John Hopkins as a professor
of medicine. And I think that he was Jewish, and I think that they approach him, and

the Jewish community there had a fund that was left by somebody from Colorado, a
Jewish businessman or something, for scholarships or something like this, and they
decided to give me a scholarship. And this is the way this [indecipherable]. But that’s
not only what happened. It’s — to come as a student in those days to this country, not only
that you had to have some kind of a scholarship, but there had to be a guarantee from
somebody, that if you run out of money, they will contribute for your expenses in school
and so on, so that you don’t remain penniless. And they c — this was done by a family of
eye doctors in — in Baltimore. They did the guarantee, but they didn’t give me any
money or something. The money was from that scholarship from the Jewish community
in — in Salt Lake City. And I paid it back when I — after — later on.
Q: Had you wanted to come to the United States?
A: Yes, I wanted to come to finish medical school. You see, this is something — it’s
something that — once you start something, you have to finish it, and I— I —I started this
and I had to finish medical school, you see, so it was very important for me to finish
medical school.

had to leave Beirut, you would have stayed there.

fact that you had to do a lot of [indecipherable] changing and shifts, gears, so to speak,
you know? There was a lot of that during the war, and you had to be very persistent to —
to be ab — to — to get out of school with a degree, you know? And a lot of people advise
me, why do you have to go up to medical school for so many years? Why don’t you
