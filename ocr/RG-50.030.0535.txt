Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview,
conducted by Peggy Frankston, with Andre, Lucie and Joyce, who were born
Zalc. All brother — a brother and two sisters, and it’s going to be — and it’s on July
23", 2009, in New York City, and it’s a continuation of the three separate
interviews that were just done, talking about wartime experiences, and perhaps
some of the experiences after the war, or some experiences before the war. So, I’d
like to start with some of the things that you know about your parents.
A: Yeah, so, my mother, she came from a family living in — in Latvia, and — not in
Riga, she was Ventspila(ph). That’s a different city, it’s a ha-harbor in Latvia. And
she had two brothers, and t-two sisters. And they owned a — a farm of cattle, a cattle
farm up there. But — and of course in Latvia there was a — a certain amount of
Jewish population. And that way Latvia also was a — belonged to Russia, but
before it belonged to Russia, was a part of Germany, was a colony of Germany.
And the people spoke German, and later they learned Russian from the Russian
occupation, or beca — the Russian got the — got the territory. And she — her — they
were selling cattle to Finland and Sweden and everywhere. But then the — the tsar
of Russia had a brother and his name was Peter. And when they went — they went
in war with Germany, a — a [indecipherable] there were — he — he was afraid of the
Jewish population because in those days the Jews were friendly with the Germans,

and they spoke Yiddish, which is an — an old German. It’s a dialect of Germany
from — from 500 years ago. So Peter decided, with his brother, the tsar of Russia,
they decided to — to take the Jews and send them to the other part of Russia by the
I-Iranian border, by the Caspian Sea, by Azrahan(ph), by Baku, Azrahan(ph).
And they were sent there. And up there they — they started a new life, with different
businesses to survive. And the gr — the grandfather, my mother’s father started
because there — up there is a lot of fish. The — the caviar comes from there, and the
—and the best fish. And the oils from the whales, too, which was like, very
important in those days. So he start the factory of smoking fish, and he was very
successful with that because in those days, in the first World War, the Russian army
had no C-rations like today, and they used to u-use a piece of smoked fish and a
piece of bread. That was the food of the Russian soldier. And — and he couldn’t
produce enough smoked fish for the government, so we’re — the government wanted
they should produce more fish, they’re working day and night. So he complained
about it. So they told him, don’t worry about it, if you’re short of labor, we give you
workers. So they gave him Turkish prisoners and German prisoners and Austrian
prisoners from the first World War, and they used to work in the factory helping to
smoke the fish. And — and two prisoners fell in love with my aunts, and they
married my aunts, and when the revolution of Russia started, the war with the

Germans and Russians stopped, because the Germans made the Russian revolution,
I don’t know if you know that, yeah. Because they got Lenin in Switzerland, and
they gave him money and they send him back to Russia to make the revolution.
And when they made the revolution, the war stopped. So those — those two
prisoners took their wives with them to Germany, and then went to United States.
And one uncle — an aunt went to Belgium. And my mother, she was young and she
wasn’t married, so she stayed with — with her folks, and the two brothers went to the
Russian army. And after the war, my mother was the only daughter home with the —
with the two brothers. They went back to Latvia from Azrahan(ph). But the
parents died in Azrahan(ph). They got — what’s that disease? The fever —
L: Typhoid?
A: Huh?
L: Typhoid?
A: Typhoid. They got typhoid, and they died from that disease. Typhus, that’s
called, and a — typhoid, yeah, in English. So they died from that disease, so my
mother became an orphan. So the Russians go — the Russian government gave a
visa, as was already after the revolution, b-because she was an orphan, they gave a
visa to go to her sister’s. One lived in the States and one lived in Belgium. So she

Q: Where was your father from?
A: My father was Polish, from L6dz, Lodz. I mean, he came to Belgium too, but he
didn’t had his birth certificate from Poland, he couldn’t get the birth certificate, he
had to go back to Poland to serve in the reserve. In Poland, after the — after the —
being in the army, he has to be four or five years in the reserve. So h-he — he
couldn’t go back there because he was married, he had no way of going back there.
So he couldn’t get married officially in Belgium, so he was just married by the
Jewish law, yeah. So —
L: But he was from Lédz.
A: He was from Lédz, yeah, but he served in the Polish army in the war with
Pilsudski. That’s the Germa — the Polish general who freed Poland from the
Russians, and Poland invaded Ukraine — Kiev, Poland took Kiev. But after that,
the Polish lost the war, and the Russians came all the way to the capital of Poland.
And things got very bad in Poland, and so he left Poland and he came to Belgium
