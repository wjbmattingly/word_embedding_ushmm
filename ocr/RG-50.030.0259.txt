Poland fall down so far. When a Jewish family went to the villages, and they, I give you money

lull the Jewish people from the religious, and the people what was hiding, they receive, the German

baked the bread, she went to the oven to hiding. And hours and hours in this very hot oven she laid
down, and she hear when the German ask in the villages. She survive.
Q. After the Germans came in, did your family do things differently? Can you tell me a little bit
about the occupation?
A. We seldom went out from the house. Every noise make us jump and scare. They come from
house in the house and they take people. We no have no place to hiding. Gentile people not hiding
us because they're scared, too. Very simple. Because easy they can move, and we cannot move. It
is the hunger, the hunger, the hunger. You no have nothing to eat. What will you eat a chair or a
sofa? You cannot eat this. In a way, when they start the Ghetto, some people was not it
would be different. They concentrate us, they must give us something to eat. The Ghetto in Lodz
was 250 million Jewish people, but of this half million people, half was Jewish. But they took the
Jewish people, what been in all of Lodz, concentrate in Ghetto in one maybe 20 of the 25 streets is

Q. But before the Ghetto, basically all of the things that you normally did changed? You couldn't
do them anymore?
A. No. Absolutely not. I never saw my friends, Gentile friends, because they been scared, too.
Q. So your social life ended?
A. Oh, complete.
Q. And the only other question I want to ask before we talk about the Ghetto a little more is, you
said your parents were very involved with the Zionist Movement?
A. Right.
Q. How did that happen? How did they get involved with that? How active were they?
A. Because the anti-Semitism existed in Poland. Polish people are different from American people.
I mean if you tell something Poland, he believe you right away. Something bad about what the
Jewish people don't, you know, or you hear the story somebody say before the war even. Jewish
people kill a Gentile girl and with her blood, they make matzo. You understand what I mean? This
is enough to be a problem. There was enough because there are one-way truck. This is Polish
people. Even today.
Q. Do you have any other memories of when the Germans came, how they treated you?
A. They treat us very, very bad. Even when they catch you, you know, some Jewish people are very
religious and follow exactly the Bible, and some people grow beard. I not mean a beard now, beard,
and have a special black coat. When German saw something like that, they catch him right away.
They don't do nothing to him. And they took many, many people to see a show from the street.
And they took scissor and start cutting his beard, and the beard was very important for
this specific sect of people, because they are very nice people. They do nothing to nobody. And it
hurts so much when you see, even if it was a little girl what I was. I do anything to finish the

anything abusive to you because you were a girl, because you were a teenage girl?
A. You mean because I was -- no. Sexual, you mean? No. No.
Q. Because what I'm trying to understand, during all of these times was it different being a girl than
a boy, I wonder?
A. If it come to physical, I don't think so. Because there was not enough to touch, my God, to touch
a Jewish girl, or even Gentile, even Gentile. No.
Q. Okay. So the Ghetto was formed.
A. Yes.
Q. Tell me a little bit about your life in the Ghetto, how it was?

and no sheets, no nothing. And after this we were working in Ghetto. The German bring us to do
job. And he ask who is, who can make uniform? Who can make anything? And everybody say, I
can do it. They no have idea how to do it, but they wanted to have a little better piece of bread or
something like that. My job was standing the lines, in the line. Why, I been took from the line
when I waiting for bread or for something like that. They take me from the line. I never saw
nobody from my family till this day.

A. Yes.
Q. Will you tell us that story?
A. Yes. Near my barrack it was dark already. They come to me. I hear crying and crying, and I
saw a girl and she tell me she's Gypsy and to help her I say, what I can help you? She say because I
have diarrhea and everything is around me. I no have rags. I no have nothing to clean. I no have
water to clean. And the Gestapo see me, they shot me on the spot. So I went to barracks, and I
found rags and little bit water. I don't know, there was rain, and I help her to clean up. And I forgot
about this. Maybe a week, maybe more, I stand in the same place, she come back and she thank me
what I help her. And she say, I want to help you. And she tell me what will be. From Hungry or
Romania, I don't remember exactly, come a transport and you barrack, they come to your barracks.
And you know thank her and I no went anymore to this barrack. And I wait, I sit in the bushes not
far away where I help cleanup her, and I wait. I don't know whether I fall asleep, probably I fall
asleep. When I wake up, I see strange people, strange language. They really took the whole
barracks, I think 41 people, to the gas chamber and substitute with the Hungarian. I went inside and
pretend I am one of them, and I stay in the barrack. She save my life.
Q. You stayed with the Hungarian people then for a while?
A. Yes.
Q. Could you talk to them?
A. Yeah. They wanted to know what's going on here? Why, when, and who? Where they went,
people. You know, you have little bit intelligence, you will be not asked a question because the
smell of burning flesh is so strong. Unbelievable. You can smell this mile and mile. Maybe they
don't know this is human, probably not. So I believe from the beginning, and I changed.
Q. Did you know what it was in the beginning?

A. No. After this. And you know, I've been so sick from this. When a transport, a new transport
come from any country, everybody go to the wire to find out, maybe to look for somebody from this
country, what is ally. I went out from this. I cannot, because I know this will be dead so soon. This
Hungarian and Romanian women are beautiful, and this beautiful women, with the children, are
going to die, maybe some will live. And this barrack been standing for a while.
Q. Were you ever aware of the guards or the police, either German or even the prisoner guards,
taking advantage of all these beautiful women?
A. I don't know. I know one things, they have a bordello. How you call this?
Q. A bordello?
A. A bordello. They took women from -- even Polish women -- to this place. But they been right
away, after they have -- how to say? After they rape the women, let's see, they died very soon after.
Q. Did you know women who were taken to this bordello?
A. Yeah. Very pretty Hungarian girls. Very.
Q. Jewish-Hungarian?
A. No. They was Hungarian. They was Hungarian girls. Very, very nice. They come so rich dress,
with the luggage. And probably the Gestapo was good for them in Hungry so they can take
everything, and they left everything. To this day they say -- I don't know how much is true -- on the
bottom of the sea, on the bottom of the river, they can find a huge, huge diamond and gold in a
special container. What they took from Hungary.
Q. And they would constantly been replenishing? They would be sending more and more women
to this bordello or whatever?

Could you come to go?
A. Yes. You have freedom after you come from work, after. But you was very careful because
anything, anything that can start the fire.

A. I think so. I have nothing, only boot and from rocks for a pillow. We put together slowly. The
rocks dirty, filthy, but we use this.

In morning we call the capo and say, she's dead.
Q. Now, were you aware of any of the medical experimentation we read about?

somebody do this.

unbelievable memories you have of camp there?

A. They come with the trucks, and they took the whole barracks. And that's it. They don't say
nothing. And we went to the train. We know why we not going to the train to die because the train
was in a different direction, and there was difference there, the ovens and the gas chamber. So we
don't know exactly where we going and are we going. And it took us maybe a day. There was
maybe 500 women, something like this. And we come to the place, it was beautiful place. It was in
the mountain, and you no see the war in this place. And they find a place, and they built something,
something you keep horses. Many, many cabins of the war, whatever it is. And next day they took
us to place where it was factory. Factory. Huge place. You no see the end. And this where I, we
start working. There was terrible. We no have gas chamber. We don't have crematory, but the train,
every day, day after day after day collected the dead or the dying people to Auschwitz. And they
show me what to do and, you know, when you wanted to sharp a knife, right? You have the
guns in the hand, and here is a machine. And you must watch not too fast, slowly. If not, they beat
you. Terrible thing. And this was my job. And this was unbelievable. I don't think so I will be
survive one day. And how I learn to breathe. You must breathe in this way. (Demonstrates
breathing technique.) And after this, you take big, deep breaths, breathe, and start again. This was
12 hours a day. And when the Gestapo no look me, we took deep breaths, breaths and start, pretend
we work, we not working. And many die. It's unbelievable how many girls died from this dust
from the guns. Unbelievable. Every times they bring us new guns, new different things, you must
catch everything fast, if not, they beat you.
Q. So you were making guns for the Germans?
A. Right.
Q. It must have been a strange feeling. Where was this factory, and what year do you think this
was?

don't have magazines. We no have nothing. We have a feeling because we see the German pack
the big guns. We see difference every day so maybe this is the end.
Q. How were the Germans acting?
A. Acting scared. The German acted scared. Not forget now, the German soldier still have a family
and children and this. Because the German say, we — the top tell us what to do. We not kill the
people, they tell us to kill. You see, they're not -- they're innocent. And so we were -- we saw
something going difference. And they come one day. We saw the Gestapo because from the
barracks where we live to the factory, we walk maybe a mile. We say, the Gestapo didn't come
today. We don't know what to thinks. And we hear, we hear the bombs, the artillery, you know, the
machines. So it is different. And we hear louder and louder and louder. We don't know who,
whether it the Germans or whether this is the American, or the Russian, we don't know. And one
times we stay in the barracks and they open the door and we saw the first Russian soldier.

in three months in Poland. Go every day, every day find out if somebody is alive. After this start,
Polish government start pushing us to take the Polish passport, belong to Poland. We don't

will build a new life. We went to Austria, walking. From Austria we decide to go to Italy. Italian

A. They're all my story so fantastic, unbelievable from the beginning. I don't know what is more
colorful, more to come to this. Day after days this life in camp was unbelievable, never end. We
wanted something happen, nothing happened. I feel so sorry for the people who suicide. I no have
the guts to. IfI died, all right, bullet or hang, but to take my life, I cannot do it. I keep myself, you
know, I joke with the girls. We talk many things. They mostly been girls in age 16, and we try to
omit the life what we live, not think about the piece of bread, not think about the coffee, coffee,
even lice welcome. I not complain. I live my life now is hard. I live on Social Security and with
the German check, what Germany send us. Because mine children are wonderful. They have life
for themself. I cannot help -- they cannot help me. I live in a nice apartment, in a nice section
because if I wanted survive, I needed apartment and away from city, far away. And I agree I no
drive a car. I never learn how to drive. And I try very hard to live busy. I love -- I have a beautiful
library, and I still go and take books every week, and I read. This is my pleasure. I no watch much
television because it not interest me, it's junk. And this, polish the furniture one times, I polish
another times and keep mind busy. I am not sociable with people. I tell you why. American people
no understand me. They cannot have the feeling. If come to people from Soviet Union, from old
country or something, they're not my people. I don't have nothing to talk to them. They're
talking about food and talking about difference. I love theatre. I cannot go often because of
transportation. No one from my friends, you know, friends, really went to theatre. I love theatre.
And this is -- I haven't not sociable life at all. I have flowers -- I love flowers -- in mine apartment.
Around apartment, I make beautiful garden. Davie, my son, help me. He live -- he live within
Silver Spring? I don't know, something like that. And he have huge piece of ground, and he makes

Q. When you had children, did that bring back memories of when you were a child?

you a fact, what happened one times. In this place, in concentration camp, come the Gestapo, and
he wanted 150 women right away. So there was mothers and daughters, and the daughters say,
mother, where you go, I'm going with you. Ino care. And she beg her, you survive. You
tell the world what happened. I am old. I am sick, and I will be died soon. And she say, no. In
nighttimes -- it was twelve o'clock nighttimes — the 150 people in five, five, and five went walk,

Gestapo say to these women, run. Run. Raus is the German word. They don't know, it's dark. And

A. Because Italian, they don't want to give me a passport. They have unemploy so many and they
must -- we understand. We was very lucky because we decide to apply to three countries, Australia,
America, or Canada. We try. What come first embassy, we going. So happen everything. Our
application to United States was mixed up. You know, when you bring up applications something,
you put it in the top, next in the top, next in the top. By accident, our application went here, and the
ambassador come to office, he took our application by mistake. We will be waiting two years.
He call us and say to us, where you want to go? We decide to go to United States because there was
the closest. We don't need to wait. After two months, application everything, he say what you
wanted to go, fly or with a ship? We decide a ship because I scared to fly. Wait, this is not the end
what's happened to me. Okay, they give us cabin and when I mention, by the end. And I am a
person like adventure. I went, six o'clock in morning, upstairs where the rich people have beautiful
cabins and so forth, and I stay and I look on the water. And I have on myself a blanket, really a --
yes, a blanket, what American soldier give me in Italy. And this blanket, I cut off, and it have
middle and with thread, I make a coat, you know, here one and here one. And that's it. When I
looked downstairs, and nobody is here, so I took the coat and throw it to the ocean because I was
ashamed with the beautiful people here. And one Marine saw something, what's going on? He saw
the coat. You know, when you something, they go flat. How you call this? You can think so this is
human, because he stopped the boat. There was near Lisbon, and they send the little dungy,
how you call this? Dingy? About ten looking for the person what jump. When I saw this, I run
right away to my cabin and start crying, and I tell my husband. He say, you crazy, what you done.
Half hour they took it to start the ship again. That's happened to me.
