dropped -- if they dropped the paratroopers or something like that, they opened fire from the

taking over offices and things [indecipherable] they want to clean up, so they grab people,
Jewish people to work, and they kept us for the whole day. We worked, we worked. So I got -- I

[indecipherable] is sort of coming with the idea we should go east because the war, she says a lot
of people went to the east [indecipherable] Russia, took half of part of Poland, and so you
figured for the time being, til they -- til they have to pull out -- back, we will stay in -- and my
mother there agreed with me, she says, go. Of course, you know, it’s -- it’s -- there’s no other
way, there’s no -- there’s no solution here now. Pretty soon the [indecipherable] be such a help
that pretty soon the -- the situation will change, since France and England got the -- stepped into
the war. So we got -- I didn’t take lot equipment, whatever you could put on, two pair of pants,
and things like th -- th-the underwears, we -- everything you could put on, you don’t take lu-

A: Is what?
Q: Was it difficult, that day?
A: Was it difficult? It was a little -- it -- I think it was a sort of general kind of -- a lot of people
were doing the same, so you -- you don’t question it too much, and you figured this -- it’s a
temporary thing, or something like that. Because I couldn’t go to work --
Q: Right, right.
A: -- you couldn’t help them, and they didn’t work, because of the -- so, whatever it is, my sister
and my mother stayed home. And I took off with Tanchim. I made the trip to go to the -- to the --

Q: Uh-huh.
A: At the Russian border --
Q: Right.
A: -- that was the only part of dry land where the -- the other parts of the border had the boke --
that river, and to go to the river is more difficult, so people took the easy way, is go to the dry
land, to the ri -- there’s a no man’s land, they said -- I mean, I didn't -- we didn’t know then
what’s -- what’s going on over there, because we went to -- we couldn’t go direct, we had to go
to Warsaw.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And take another train. We couldn’t ride the train --

the yellow p -- the yellow patch, yellow lata, and [indecipherable] we took off the latas, the --
Q: You took them off?
A: Took them off, because Jews were not allowed to ride on the train and we couldn’t get tickets,
so could recognize us Jewish, so Tanchim’s girlfriend, a girl was so different, she put on the
scarf, and the thing what -- ah. She went over in the -- bought -- bought two tickets for us, and
we got a train to Warsaw. So the train was at night, th-the right -- you know, it was good because

L.D.?
A: They knew, they -- yes.
Q: There was a --
A: Jude -- J -- Jude.
Q: Jude, there was, yeah.
A: Then we got to Warsaw. I had a distant cousin and we stayed overnight over there. And
Warsaw was a different -- it wasn’t the Third Reich, it was the Polish government, the Polish
police and things like that, and people were not that -- sort of under the impression -- under the
same -- it wasn’t the same kind of government, it -- it -- temporary. They sort of -- there were a
lot of bla -- black marketing and people -- people were running around, and my cousin -- s -- I
stayed with my cousin overnight one day -- overnight. The next day we took the train to
Malkinia, cause there was a direct train. And that was a lot of -- there were a lot of Jewish people
in the train because everybody was going to the border, to the Ru-Russian border.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And the -- at the -- at the end of the Malkinia, the train stopped and we -- everybody -- they
said, everybody out, because that’s the last stop. So, we can’t stay on the train. So everybody has
to leave and you couldn’t leave because there was rows of S.S., both sides, and you cou -- they
wouldn’t let you go no place til the train pulls out, and they li-lined up everybody, all these
people in -- in -- in a line -- in lines, and marched away. And took us into a -- half a mile maybe,

yard -- big courtyard and they put us in -- into this courtyard and S.S. guy -- S -- S.S. guys
around us, you know, marching back and forth round the people and they all gave us orders. First
they said -- put up our hands in the air. We started in the morning, we stay there all day long. We
didn't know ma -- S.S. what’s going on, what this -- kind of game this is. Towards the evening,
about -- I guess what [indecipherable] about four o’clock in the evening, in -- towards the
evening, I didn't even know when they start taking in people into the -- they’re all around w-were
barracks, small barracks in the courtyard. And when I di -- all people who mar -- is -- were taken,
so now our time is to go into this separate room that -- that lead us -- they let us come to the end -
- toward the end of this place, there’s a bar -- a barrack, a wooden barrack and we going into this
-- to go into this place. I don’t know -- I didn’t know what -- what’s for, everybody in. As we got
into this barrack, the hall -- the first hall is s -- low tables like that, a lot of tables, low like this,
about 10 people at each table, hours we have to stand around, and here cames the S.S. man with
the worker here, the man, he says, give up everything what you have, all the valuables and
money. Put this on the table. He says, those who wouldn’t, and you have hidden someplace,
we’ll find it. You’ll get shot. You’ll be shot. And that’s all. Well, there were some people there,
there were some people not [indecipherable] but most people, they put out everything, watches,

Q: Right.
A: There was another table, and -- a big one, and an S.S. man to each table. He says come over,
and I -- I didn’t move so fast, he had a cane with a round handle. He took his cane with the --
pulled me with the --
Q: The hook?
A: -- the neck -- no, the candle he put -- the cane put as my -- around my neck and pulled me
over to his -- to hi -- closer, that I wasn’t close enough, to search me. And he [indecipherable]
says, open your coat. I open my coat, I had a good coat on, you know, I made it for myself.
Q: Right.
A: And [had a good shirt on, and another pair of pants, and another -- I been dressed up okay
[indecipherable]. So he tried to -- he says to me, where did you hide the money? I says, I have no
money. A watch? No, I don’t wear watches. So he didn’t think long, he looked at me, and he
took that cane and he gave me over -- hit me over twice, over my head, and blood started, came
down my face, and I was [indecipherable] and I stand s-stiff, and I don’t move. I -- he says, now
you gonna give me the money, or gonna gi -- you gonna get the other -- you gonna get again the
same thing. I said, I don’t have money. He says to me, [indecipherable] you was tailor, where did
you hide the money? You know, I did not tell him I’m a tailor, but he says, you were a tailor, you
know, you -- where did you hide the money? I says, I didn't hide it, I don’t have it. He gave me
another hit and go. And as -- and he gave me -- and had to go out. On the way out everybody was
-- those who were checked were lined up to go out. At the way out on this -- there was a sole of -
- sort of a walk, and the both sides were S.S. people with sticks, or pipes, or whatever --
whatever you had in the hand, and you have to go through and they hit you. So I didn’t have

the head, so I put -- protect my head and I s -- kept running and they been hitting both sides.
Finally we got out. He let us go out, we came in into the no man’s land, the no man’s land
between the Soviets and the German. There were so many people, masses of people, women and
children. And the Russian guard wouldn’t let through.
Q: Wouldn’t let anybody through?
A: No. One [indecipherable] us through and then people with kids come and beg, and n-nothing
helps, nobody went through, nobody can do, oh, wa -- they say we have to ask -- we have to
formally ask for permission and we have to return then, if you get the permission, then you -- if
you get a permit, we’ll let you through. So days -- there were 14 days on that cold winter
November days, and snow and rain. So the only thing we had, some peddlers have bread to sell,
so there was some bread and [indecipherable]. That’s all we could get. And day by day we talked
to [indecipherable]. On the 14'" day we saw some, you know, [indecipherable] in the morning. It
was a nice morning and the -- wasn’t snowing and raining. We saw in the distance that some
people s -- go through, and they sort of disappear, they go into the woods. On the other side were
wooded areas where the Russian guards were there. So I said, maybe that is the good way. So we
thought this is probably smugglers, which they know and -- where to -- where there is a better
passage.
Q: Right.
A: So we did follow them, we went through the border, and nothing, nobody check. I mean, no
guards or nothing, you know, cause they knew whether it -- it was bribe somebody or something,
I don’t know, the smugglers maybe they have a way of bribing guards or whatever. We didn’t
see any guards and we went toward the [indecipherable] and --

Q: Did you know where you were going? Did you -- I mean, did you have a destination? You
weren't sure?
A: No.
Q: You just wanted to get to the Russian side.
A: Yeah. Well, the next town we know is Bialystok.
Q: Mmn-hm.
A: The big town. But this was a small town we came over to, Bora, and in a few kilmatersa -- ki
-- kilometers like that, there was a s-station, the train station, we took tr -- we took the train and
we came to Bialystok, which wasn’t far.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Bialystok was a town wall -- wall to wall refugees, people from the other side, every
[indecipherable] full of people.
Q: Really?
A: Full. You couldn’t go into a house if you -- if you wanted to go ask for a cu -- for a drink of --
cup of water, or a glass of water, they wouldn’t let you in the house. They put -- they put -- they
got water out to you, a glass of water, they gave you a glass of water and that’s it. Or a cup of
water. This -- you know, they were afraid to let somebody in the house. They didn’t know who it
is, and we looked poor, something like that.
Q: Right.
A: They looked -- we looked, you know, bloody and -- and I-I mean there’s muddy, and --
muddy and bloody and so everything [indecipherable]. So we walked around and we met some
people on the street, you know [indecipherable] some people we knew from Lodz, or -- nobody
had these -- a solution of what to do. They were registering -- the government registered people

to go to coal mines to work. If you wor -- they say, if you register, we can, in a week or so, or
two weeks, you might get the -- you go to work. Well, I really didn't want to go to the coal mines
[indecipherable] then we didn’t go too far, and now soon we gonna go back home, so we had --
don’t want to go so far up in the [indecipherable] in the coal mines. And so there was no place,
SO we got -- the evening -- towards the evening, there was no place where to go to sleep. So I
went a shul.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And we slept in the shul, on a bench. And the next day we go again out in the street,
[indecipherable] again the people, they come in the evening -- we come in the evening to
[indecipherable] where we slept, some like that, some other people came and they s -- they took
our place. [indecipherable] it’s not mine, you know, I couldn’t, you know, how -- how could you
-- so I had to walk out, we walked out in the streets, we start walking the street. We didn’t have -
- we have no place where to go. So we figured, well maybe we should take a tra -- the trains
were running, should take a train to the next small town, somewheres, whatever it is, another --
another 50 - 70 miles, maybe it’s better there, there aren’t that many people over there. Here,
everybody sticks to one place. So we got to the station, to the train station, we get -- they wait --
waiting in line for tickets, and the man, a Jewish man [indecipherable] is behind us and he looks
at us, says where you going? I said, we’re going next town. What’s the matter, he says, you got
relatives there? So why you -- what kind of che -- what you do? I said, we’re tailors. We all of u
-- we all of us were tailors, three of us. [indecipherable] me and Tanchim, we met a guy, one
guy, another friend of ours on the border, we took him along, so we’re three of us. Oh, tailors, he
says, I’m going to a town where my daughter lives and I’m sure it’s a better town than here, it’s a
little further, and you’ll be better off. Y-You’re tailors, I’m sure you’ ll get work over there,

li -- Pll give you the sofa, and you’ll [indecipherable] the third one, we’ll find another place, so
the two of you -- well, it’s a big -- a good deal, two of us [indecipherable]. So we all agreed. We

daughter at night, and -- and he told her that he brought two -- two guests, you gotta give them

then we rushed home. We rushed home, back to Baranovich. Trains were loaded already, people
were running from all over, from the countryside to the ci -- to the town. Baranovich was the
nearest town, which we lived, so we went back. Coming back was really -- the town -- the
situation of early war time. [indecipherable] were bombing, and ai-air attacks and things like

us, you know, the agency, the Soviet agency, they had said that they are be -- beating back the
enemy, and that will -- it’s -- wasn’t true, it was -- they were right here, next door, and then
probably we wouldn’t -- didn’t rush to evacuate, to go -- to run away. It does -- til it was too late.
The bomb -- the trains were bombed, and we -- they -- they couldn’t go, and walking, we walked
until these planes, they shoot us -- shoot on us and -- and so we had to go back. And going back
is -- you have to settle -- we stayed in a place, in a -- a home, because the war -- at a friend’s
uncle’s house, which he lived there, in -- at his house. So he had a room, a lot of room, so one
room he gave us, because he figured they wouldn’t let him have the whole house anyhow. So
one room we -- our -- our guys, the [indecipherable] there, stayed there in that room, and til we’ ll

meanwhile, they start already asking for workers -- workers. So the Judenrat was appointed
[indecipherable] they needed workers for some project, we didn’t know what. So we were not
the ci-citizen, you know, I mean, it’s not a citizen from Baranovich, you know, we -- we were
refugees, so we were the first ones to go. So we went to this work, and then we start working, our
three guys, and -- the three friends of ours went to work, and this was at the Air Force, German
Air Force had a base, and they did rebuild -- not rebuild, but extend the airport. And it was the
Polish -- old Polish airport, but the -- since the Air Force is -- is big, that they need more s --
more runways and more things like that. So they took 300 people from us, from -- from Jewish --
from the ghetto, which was not the ghetto yet, but [indecipherable] Jewish people already had to
supply workers before the ghetto started. And they had 300 non-Jewish people working. So there
was about 600 people working at this airfield to rebuild -- to extend the airfor -- rebuild the airfor
-- the air force -- the airfield. And I worked a terrible job, I had a terrible job in the -- to re --
unload the cement, loose cement in a barn when they -- they put the trains in a -- they lo -- they tr
-- the trains went into a -- gathered into a barn, a big barn and they had loose cement on the -- on
the platforms, and it has to be removed from the -- from the train because that train has to go
again. It’s just loose, this --
Q: How did you do it?
A: It was so terrible work, you know, with this -- I -- I felt that I wouldn’t last long really, at this
work, it’s so hard.
Q: Did you do it with a shovel?

Q: And who chose you? Was it the Judenrat who chose you, or the Germans who cho -- how
[indecipherable]
A: Actually, Judenrat wants workers. They -- and since we s-sort of were refugees, we the first
ones to go because the others had families and thanks to that we have no families, so I -- I didn’t
mind. I mean, we went to work. So what is there -- we can’t be -- we can’t avoid that, we going
to have to -- sooner or later we figured we’ll have to go -- we’ll do something. Anyhow, we
couldn’t say no. As we worked -- as I worked ever d -- at this job [indecipherable] time, I really
got sick from that. So at -- one morning the foreman, you know, we had this guy, Jewish guy was
the foreman from 300 people. In the morning he divided people different -- different play -- jobs.
There were electricians, there were carpenters, you know. So one day he ask for a tailor, who is a
tailor. So I raise my hands, where are tailors, better to work than that. So I said -- then I start
working as a tailor and as soon they open -- they gave me a room and a machine, and
[indecipherable] set up a tailor room where I could work. Was a different cha -- a big change. I
felt, you know, now I could rec -- could -- could hold on til -- I don’t know. We worked there
and it was in the beginning not bad. I mean, as slave work, we didn’t get paid. He told us, you
are slave workers. You can’t get -- you get -- don’t get paid. The others, Friday got -- they got
paid. The o -- the 0 --

Q: Got paid.
A: -- there was 300, they got paid. And we, we [indecipherable] the workers, but not paid. So --
and I s-set up and it was better than cement work. | had all the guy -- all these officers came in
for work -- kind of work, pants, sometimes they had uniforms, and sometimes civilian clothes, I
don’t know. There were so many changes. They wore in the beginning civilian clothes and then
they had a uniform. So anyway, there was always work to do. And I also do so -- did some work
for the Air Force people itself, you know, the military, because when they came they saw sh --
they [indecipherable] a ta -- a tailor, they want him -- e-everybody had an -- they needed. And I
all of a sudden [indecipherable] later, a German officer who -- I said, without his permission I

A: What I still -- we still went to work in the morning and we came back, you know, with the --
we had the I.D. card and when they put together this ghetto, there was a -- a gar -- a guard in -- in
the front of the gate, and you gotta show -- and you showed him the -- to go to work and then
they come to work, ya -- they -- or they searched you if you have a package, they searched, and
to -- so I went on with that, I worked, and we helped ourselves a little bit because we have people
coming in, different people, different kind of people, nobody checked me what I do, or what
[indecipherable] I do. I did some side work. So I made -- you know, to go through
[indecipherable] to -- to make something to go -- you know, people s -- usually everybody gave
something. You know, no matter -- the officers, they -- to -- the guy around me -- had one guy
who was a ta -- a tall guy, a big strong guy, he was -- he was so mean, and when he came in to
have work done and he always brought something. Bread, butter, and things like that, and he was
in charge [indecipherable]. So -- so rem -- he [indecipherable] in a way that you could -- he
could have a -- you know, stay in [indecipherable]. He didn’t bother us. I worked, nobody came
in to check me, what I wad -- what I work, but I wa -- they were -- just want the acceptance if
they came -- outside people, if they came in, they want to have them h-have the um -- our -- pi --
pi -- our officers should give them permission. They got it.
Q: Are they killing Jews at this point, do you know?
A: At the what? At the --
Q: In the area.
A: In the area?
Q: Yeah. Do you know anything?

the shop. He had a tailor -- his store, with the business. They want him to give up the business
because he is a -- so he formally gave up the business to a worker of his. I-In other words, it
should have a -- a -- put a -- it’s under his name is the facto -- what is the business, but he took
the -- he di -- he took the profit, the money or whatever it is they made. And that was finally wa -
- who -- whose told the -- I mean, the authorities, they s -- they says what he does, he was
arrested and he was hanged, publicly on the pla -- on the -- before the ghetto was closed, he --
they asked everybody -- the people to go and see it. You know, that’s to scare the people up, you
know, like the -- not to do anything on their own -- on the -- on the -- what they wanted is
[indecipherable]. Well, anyhow, these things occurred and they also here and there, when they
need workers or they need people, they’ve been taken away, they never -- we never saw them
back. So that was until the ghetto was in a -- a -- still a set up and they had a one meter -- they
gave us one meter per person. One meter space in a -- in a -- you have a room like that, and you
can put eight, 10 people. So eight every -- one meter per person.
Q: One meter?
A: One meter. So they -- they measured -- you know, that was, you know, it -- handled it
perfectly, I mean, they adore us. And we set up the ghetto pretty good, the doctors -- the doctors
set up a sort of hospital inside to handle the sick people, and everything was working, organized.
So I don’t know if they liked that, probably didn’t like that organized kind of a -- a ghetto, pretty
sure. Anyhow, one day they came to ask for -- for 12 doctors. The SS gave always orders what
they want. You know, one time they want gold, wanted silver, and -- and one day I was out of
work and I was grabbed as a hostage -- as a hostage for a -- because they demand some amount
of -- of money or something like that, it took a long time to get together, to get the -- collect the
money from people. So they took a --

Q: So you were a hot -- the Germans took you as a hostage?
A: Yeah. Even though I been w -- I had the -- a -- even though I had a -- a LD. to -- I worked ina
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: -- a German place, it -- it di-didn’t ag -- they didn’t care about that, who -- everybody’s on
their own, they have a different law, the SS has different laws. So they again took us into a place
where -- enc-enclosed place, about -- I don’t know, couple of hundred people, hostages, and they
threatened they will kill us if they are not delivered. And the whole day long we been with our
hands up and the machi -- the machine guns all around, and watching these -- the few hu -- the
people who were not the hostages. And towards the evening, ar -- they took out nine people and
they s -- and they did, they said they gonna shot them, execute them to show them that they mean
business, the Judenrat, they should give -- they didn’t deliver enou -- along -- soon enough the --
the ransom. So they killed 10 people -- nine people. So -- so then the Judenrat tried to give -- de-
deliver the -- deliver the ransom and we were freed in -- towards the evening. That’s one thing.
So every day it was some other kind of -- sort of action again.
Q: What -- what -- what was happening to you? Were you getting depressed, were you getting
angry?
A: Depressed.
Q: Do you -- do you -- do you remember what it was feeling like?
A: I don’t remember, we just followed the others, and --
Q: So you were just going to keep going.
A: Keep going. Keep going as long as -- as we could physically. Mentally, just kind of -- it was

of doing -- of getting out or something like that, and there’s no way out. No way out. And every
day something else, they took people. And I worked over there, I worked as a -- in the shop, so
the best thing was at work, so they didn’t -- he couldn’t -- you know, at -- at work we weren’t
bothered with the -- the SS didn’t bothered with SS, we, as workers we had a lot of people,
everybody worked at his job was -- was a kind of relief --
Q: Right.
A: -- because when we got back to the city, you locked up in the ghetto, you just like a -- oh, a
closed -- closed world, you know, you -- you -- th-then it depressed when you come home, when
you come to the ghetto. But s -- it -- it -- th-the [indecipherable] we were thinking of escape, but
we had no arms, we had nowhere, nothing to escape. You sort of need some arms. Well --
Q: So who -- who are you talking with? Or is -- is there a -- is there a --
A: The ghetto people -- people in ghetto, maybe our -- my -- my friends and myself, we were
talking about -- about escaping. But there was tho -- we ha -- we really didn’t know the area, we
didn’t know enough. So we waited, we had prepared ourself to escape and something, but we did
not move until we’ll get either some bigger group or something like that. Meanwhile, pe -- we
heard a lot of people being killed. Besides that, every time there’s another incident, another
reason. We had this -- where we worked we had a one officer who was a supply officer, was this
Smith and he was -- he’s lo -- a nice -- you know, nice guy, nice guy. He was doing -- so the
foreman was from Warsaw and he had -- he says he had made trip to -- to Poland. So we ask
him, just a joke, you know, can I go with you? He says yes. He took him to Warsaw to his
family, he saw his family in -- in -- in Warsaw and he’s -- when he came back he says, oh,
Warsaw is -- is [indecipherable] there’s no threat of being killed, you know, like here, we have

Q: To get to Warsaw.
A: -- to go to -- back to Warsaw because it’s so bad here, every day people being killed. And
anyhow, he -- he didn't succeeded, you know, cause it was -- waited too long, this Smith wa --
the Smith was gone and another -- he -- he contacted even -- made a deal with another guy, a
German chauffeur who drove and he collected some friends from Warsaw, those who want to go
to Warsaw. He -- he brought such a beautiful picture of Warsaw, the black market is so busy,
what -- he saw the good things, I don’t know. I-It was a bad -- but the Warsaw ghetto wasn’t bet
-- much better, but he saw the good. Maybe his family was involved in business or something
like that. And so when he collected the all people, those who want to go in Warsaw, he collect
too the money, and the -- the chauffeur, which is the guy I don’t know how ba -- how goo -- how
well he knew him, when he took him in the morning -- in the morning he picked him up, he
picked up all the passengers and he drove right to the SS. So --
Q: They killed him.
A: They killed him, sure, right away. So, about the doctors, he took it -- they ask for 12 doctors,
and if a doctor which I have been seeing, he told me he was a cu -- throat and -- and ear
specialist. And so I knew him because I’ve seen him a few times, and I met him some other time.
He came home running -- he came home with a satchel from a patient and his wife told him to --
th -- they were here looking for you because they need 12 doctors, and they need for some camp
which -- I don’t know, it’s just the -- you know, excuse, I would ge -- to make them feel good,
that they’re going to help sick people. And he is -- was running to help sick people. There’s some
[indecipherable] sick people in the camp, which he -- they need 12 doctors. And he missed the --
the -- this group, I mean, other words, they were looking for him and they went without. But he

who still -- he still got -- include him in a group, and they led him away and they killed him right
at -- right in the s -- not -- you know, into the SS quarter -- headquarters. So this was the daily --
daily things what happened, and we thought of escaping. We -- some people tried to escape, I
don’t know if they made it. They also didn’t have any arms. The time went by, we worked all
winter, and then -- then they were really -- they were coming to us that sort of we heard about the
massacres in other towns. Was the people we worked with, sometimes some par -- some people -
- some peasants came to work and they told us certain towns there were some massacres
[indecipherable] out, you know, like next town [indecipherable] neighboring towns. So we really
thought of escapings, you know, but we waiting for -- for y -- we had no organized groups to

lot of people worked outside the ghetto, and they put all these people [indecipherable] waiting
for this -- for what, I don’t know. We waited til the ha -- our president, our Judenrat president
appeared and he says that the German authorities want some 200 people for different -- for
different work in railroad something. It was really lies, but to make it -- it -- it’s prepa -- a

worked for the German [indecipherable] organizations, German [indecipherable] could go to
work.
Q: So they were protected in some way.
A: They were.
Q: Yeah.
A: So we go to work, we didn’t know if -- what is going to happen now. They -- they were
protected, so there’s -- they wanted to keep the workers still working, while they take -- and they
want to take the kids and the elderly, a-and to get 4,000 in the first place, for them. So is --
Isikson refused, s-so they let them go home, and we, sort of after we heard what’s going on, we
stayed in the place, we didn't go ho -- go to work -- go to -- home after work --
Q: You stayed there.
A: -- the same day. We didn’t go home. And we did hide in our -- and rarely you find a place to
hide, until we’ll -- the things what we heard what’s going on [indecipherable] in the ghetto. So --
and towards the evening, we sort of were told to go to get ready to go home, to go to the ghetto.
So we were about 73 people, those who remained hiding inside, they didn’t want -- want to go
[indecipherable] and we didn’t go before, but now they want to wait, they said they -- they have
to go to the ghetto, you had to go home. And here we still heard the news from -- and we heard
the guns -- machine guns, that they’re still killing people. So there was question, you know, was
like going to a ghetto, you going right into -- to the open -- to this slaughter. So the people were
afraid to go, but they had to -- they had to sort of make sure to -- to stay. If they could stay, they
would say if they could stay here in the -- in the place of work another night, would be good. So
one lady came into my tailoring room with a gold watch and she put the watch down and said --
she told me, go in and talk to the -- our head. Rudel is the head of the -- our officers, if -- to bribe

him, he should let us stay one night more. If they a -- the slaughter will go by. So I said -- looked
at her, I said, you -- you know, you crazy, because I -- this man never came into me, I
[indecipherable] he doesn’t know me, cause the others -- officers work -- came in for work, he
never came in to work -- for work. And so is -- but til -- she left the watch, she walked out, you
do it. I says, that’s the only way out -- she said, whether I could -- could do it, and think to do it.
And I was sitting in [indecipherable] says, she is crazy. I mean, he never -- he never came -- he
never know me -- he never came to me, and I can-cannot go bribing somebody like that, you
know, it’s -- it’s ridiculous. Well, waiting, waiting, waiting, and there’s no other solution, so the
pe -- so people says, well, what can you -- what would you do? What can you do? Well, I said,
I’ll -- have no choice and I have to go, whatever is -- if -- if | wouldn’t do that, you say, oh, if
you would have gone, you have -- do -- did something, it -- it would have -- it would have been
something. Now, we are really without any he -- without any help. So I took this watch and I
walked over, this is one barrack where the officers lived, and I have that [indecipherable]
everything over there in one bag. I walked over and I -- I la -- never was in this office, never
went -- I knew more or less where the doors -- it’s right the first door. So I knocked the door, and
he says, enter [indecipherable]. So I walked in and I s -- was -- had to stand on the rear door, I
didn’t move. I just walked in, I didn’t move, because his -- this room, the decorations around
give you a sc -- give you such a scare, all this Hackenkreuz is -- banners hanging and the
[indecipherable], the Hitler and Goerings and everything all around. Is -- is just like Goering or
something, or some other officer in his office in -- in a -- in the back of the room, and in a -- ina
de -- on the desk. And I says -- so -- so he says, well, well, was -- what do I want -- what do you
want? Say, I want to talk to you. So he -- he sits in a [indecipherable] so come here. I walk over
and I didn’t ask anything, I took out the watch and put on the table. He says -- I says, look, this is

what we have, what one of the ladies have and she doesn’t need it, because if we go home the
ghetto we gonna be killed anyhow, you might use it, s -- give it -- send it to you. One of your
family, I don’t know whether he was married or not, never knew. He says to me in a quiet way,
he says take it back, I don’t want it, I don’t need it. [indecipherable] and I le -- I look at him and I
was -- I don’t see the same person. He -- he asks me to sit down, and you know what -- what
happen. And I sit down, I says, take the watch. Forget it, he says, take it back, and nothing going
to happen to you. It’s over. In other words, this load is over. And nothing is going to happen to
you, nothing is going to happen. I said, well I still hear the guns. He says, I -- I have or -- I have
information, he says. So I walk out and -- with this news, and I told the guys waiting for me, and
I told them that we could go home and nothing is going to happen, it’s over. Meanwhile, we still
heard the guns, we still heard the machine guns go. And time goes shorter and we -- we have to
go soon, at six o’clock we going home. So they said to me, look, we going to go a column with
people, with 70 people. They don’t know who we are or what ev -- what kind of [indecipherable]
we have. See -- do something, tal-talk to him, see if maybe he’! send somebody to explain to the
guards, you know. Well, I said, maybe they’re right, but since I saw that he is -- didn’t -- he -- he
not, you know, the same guy is over there. So I went over and I -- again, I says that the people
are afraid to go because they don’t know where they will -- if they know what we are, who we
are or something like that. And I said, if you would have [indecipherable] I mean, I thought -- as
I thought -- if you would go with us to lu -- I mean, to the gate and te -- explain who we are. So
he was thinking a few minutes. Okay, I’ll go. So he got into his car and he drove ahead and we
marched with 12 guards, of Air Force guards to the ghetto. And it was not complete over, but it
was over. At that moment, when we came to the gates, we saw Mr. Isikson was led out by SS.
Two guys took him and his assistant to their car and put them away -- took him away, for good.

So that’s why, he did -- he didn’t obey the orders. He didn’t give them the 4,000 people. He
made [indecipherable] -- so that’s what it is. I mean, they -- they ne -- appointed another guy for
Judenrat, for -- they appointed another guy.
Q: You -- you said that --
A: I been -- we been waiting in -- in front of the ghet -- gate, to be -- to --
Q: To go back in.
A: -- to go back in.
Q: And saw --
A: But they weren't that finished, they didn’t clean up -- they didn’t -- til they put a -- bore out
the juden -- the -- Mr. Isikson, and then they opened the gates and -- to get -- to let in us, our
people. My pe -- my group of people.
Q: Right. How did you know what Isikson had said, that he refused? Is that --
A: When I came in the ghetto --
Q: People told you?
A: -- the guy who was the Judenrat man, told us.
Q: That that’s why he was taken.
A: [indecipherable] a part of the Judenrat, not the -- nobody was a -- but he pol -- told us -- he
told us he was -- around the ghetto he was a member of the Judenrat and he was supposed to be -
- to accompany the SS when they lo -- loaded the people on trucks, out to the -- to the shooting
place. But before, when I left him since -- first time, when I went out his door, another officer
which used to come into me with a lot of work [indecipherable] well, no f -- more kind of -- he
obviously used to talk, have a d -- you know, he -- he used to come in more often, and he

know, like a front yard [indecipherable] 150 yards, and he start -- he’s talking to me in working,
that this morning, he says, they took us, all the officers, not only us, but officers in the whole
town who have workers -- officer who work here, and the -- for the germ -- German officers,
they took him -- they took them to show the slaughter [indecipherable]. They -- they -- the way
they -- what they -- what they do, they want to show off how they kill the people, and he says --
Mr. Lindow, Mr. Lindow says unthinkable, unbelievable, he says. What they did, it’s
unbelievable, unthinkable. How’d they do it? He probably didn’t want to go too long with --
walk along outside with me, but this few steps he did it, he told me what happened. In other
words they all -- and he -- and he [indecipherable] was along with them. And that probably gave
him a shock, and he changed. He changed to a degree that was such the completely different. He
was really -- he was really -- he didn’t know what to do. He was -- you know, I couldn’t
recognize him. You know, he walked around, he didn’t say a word, he didn’t say to u -- to u -- to
the others. S-So that was -- his story was -- didn’t end yet because soon after, we -- groups -- we
had a resistance group in the ghetto, and we escaped. And with some arms left, we had a nice
bunker. I build a bunker which is we had some arms, the resistance had some arms, and we sort
of prepared for resistance. And since they took us out from the ghetto [indecipherable] resistance
wasn’t working.
Q: Couldn't happen.
A: It couldn’t happen. But when we came back, some of my arms, my bunker wasn’t dis --
wasn’t discovered. I mean, they found a lot of bunkers and they dis -- confiscated a lot of arms,
which we prepared for the resistance.
Q: Where did you get arms? Where did you get weapons from?

A: Well, we had y -- you know, y -- our people worked to collect the arms from the Russian
military. When they gave up, they left in the woods and the fields, so they had to collect these, so
the people from the ghetto worked this -- with this comp -- with this group to bring the arms, so
they smuggled in these arms, from rifles to grenades, you know, as much as they could. So I had
the -- my -- my -- my friend Tanchim was -- was the head from my group, we had five in a group
prepared. And our -- we -- since we had a rifle and grenades in our -- in our bunker, and our
bunker was not found. So, in other words, we planned an escape and it’s the only arms we had,
the others were confiscated. And we prepared an escape. We didn’t know which way, whether
through the ghetto, cut the g -- cut the barbed wires, or from the place we work, from the airfield
-- airfield. It took us time to get this -- smuggle the arm -- we decided to escape from the airport,
and so our people were the electricians. Our people who were from our resistance group, they
worked -- they were electricians and they worked out in the airfield, further out, and over there at
the airfield we walked around free. We didn’t -- even though we had patches and things like that,
nobody bothered us.
Q: But they were -- the electricians were farther away than you were.
A: What?
Q: The -- the electricians were farther away than you were?
A: No, no, they were --
Q: They were in the same f -- airfield?
A: The same airfield, but they were in -- into the airfield that they are almost like further out in
the [indecipherable] they worked th -- the electrician --

A: -- [indecipherable] installations, so they worked out further, so we -- they explained that
there’s some bushes we could stay there all day long, go to work and from work, the little -- this
-- you know, single people could go there to the point where we ha -- go together and in the
evening, we’ll escape with the whole group.
Q: Now can -- can I ask you something?
A: Huh?
Q: Were -- were there -- a number of resistance groups in the ghetto?
A: There were what?
Q: Were there a number of resistance groups in the ghetto, not just yours, there were other ones?
A: There were the other two, yeah.
Q: There were two more?
A: Two
Q: Two more?
A: There were, in general, two resistance groups, separate, you know, but they -- different plans,
we had different plans. But at this point the ghetto was already divided again, smaller and
[indecipherable] and there -- and there was a lot of people --
Q: Right.
A: You know [indecipherable] cause the resistance lost a lot of people, even those -- our own
people. So the other escape was planned for my group, plans with our arms [indecipherable] in
our basement [indecipherable] but still it was on the other side, the ghetto was cut off shorter.
You know, they -- there were less people, they cut -- they cut the ghetto shorter.

A: So even though there were -- our arms were in the other side, behind barbed wire, but we
managed to go through [indecipherable] guys -- the guys went over at night [indecipherable] get
into -- brought into the new ghetto, our arms --
Q: So they went over the fence?
A: Cut the wires.
Q: They cut the wires?
A: Cut the wires, and we watched the guards. The guards were going back and forth.
Q: Right.
A: And we want to get these arm back to the place where worked at the airport -- at the airfield.
From there we planned to escape. As we --
Q: Can I ask you something?
A: Yeah.
Q: This sounds different from --
A: What?
Q: This -- this kind of behavior, for you --
A: Yeah?
Q: -- being in the resistance, seems different than what you did before.
A: Different?
Q: So what -- what made you join the resistance?
A: What made join the resistance is simply because you cannot go to the slaughter like sheeps.
Q: So you wanted to do something.
A: Wanted [inaudible], and of course there was no, assurance, you know. Sure, it’s a lost battle,
but you want to have a resistance, as much as we could do.

Q: Right.
A: As much as we could do. And we [indecipherable] arms, their arms are better, but we knew
it’s not the same -- it’s not the same as -- it’s not a even struggle. But we got to do something.
But later on, when it turned out that we were left with a few arms only, and the -- and most of the
resistant people were killed in -- in the ghetto, so [indecipherable] there were left, we were 24
people together, we made the escape.
Q: And when was the escape, do you know?
A: When the escape?
Q: About.
A: About, it was October, something like that.
Q: Was it cold, snowy, or --
A: Oh, cold, really [indecipherable] was sep -- August, it is the end of September, octo --

escape. I mean, you can escape --

stronger. I know it --
Q: Right, right.

we hand out just the one hand grenade, makes you so strong that you feel -- you walk differently,

got out the arms outside to the airfield over there and we -- the arms were hidden in the bushes
and then we made the escape. We made the group together, little by little --
Q: This is 24 pe --
A: -- single -- single people.
Q: -- uh-huh.
A: Single few people just [indecipherable] not going one group, but just we knew that we’re in
the group together, little by little and we -- we grouped together at [indecipherable] you know,
it’s [indecipherable] now. You know it’s a little -- in September -- is it -- was it October, or that’s
-- or something like that, something like -- it was -- the summer was over. And -- and days are --
and people -- what the guys who worked there, and they came later, told us what -- when we
were escaped and then the foreman is counting us, that -- and he reported to -- to the Rudel that
24 people missing. He says they escaped. So -- so he -- s -- that’s what they told us, that Rudel
said, in -- in German, yeah, when they’Il -- Wenn sie rieten Kennen losen die Laufen. That’s the
-- when -- when they can save themselves, let them -- let them run. So he was the -- he became a
different man and he chose later, if you want to finish his story, his story didn’t end yet, cause
when we entered -- when we came to the parti -- partisan -- we met partisans, Russian partisans,
they sort of were very anti-Semitic, but they [indecipherable] you -- you have to -- you have no
arms, you know, you’re not armed. We had our -- the rifles were -- he said, is not -- not enough.
You cannot fight, he says, with this, you gotta get arms. So you gotta send out here -- do
something, you know, he was really pushing us to -- to some point that you couldn't say no, was
-- so he says, you gotta send out people to get arms, or to do some sabotage work. You couldn’t
do it if the fe -- you’re not armed you can’t anything, but anyhow, we -- the -- our leaders did

Q: Can -- can you hold that thought, because we have to make a change of the tape.
A: Okay.
Q: So the arms, we’ll start there.
End of Tape Six
Beginning Tape Seven
Q: Henry, let me ask you something. This group that you are talking about, where they’re saying
to you you have to go and get arms in order to be able to be in this group, cause you -- you didn't
come out with enough -- is that the first group you were with?
A: That was the first group. There was another --
Q: Wi -- how did you know where to go? You leave the ghetto --
A: That’s -- that -- it’s interesting, you know, and it’s true, you know, you’re a -- good question,
because we didn’t know, we weren't -- we never -- we didn’t grow up over there, we were mostly
more from -- most of the group probably people from -- from Poland --
Q: Mm-hm.
A: -- on the other side, but some people promise they know the law, they know the area, but it
didn’t work -- it didn’t -- I don’t know if they told the truth. They just probably want to go to ca -
- take part in the escape and they promised they know. Is -- you know, that happened a lot of
things which are not expected, you know.
Q: Right.
A: But we have inside pe -- we had now a group people, intelligent and people that -- we had sa -
- little map -- they had some o -- little map, they -- they could [indecipherable]. Well, this guy

a railroad, small rail tracks like they been carrying woods from the woods -- from the woods, all
wood from the woods [indecipherable] get to this tracks, will be on the right track, in other, will
go through -- the track goes through the woods. He figured out this here. So that was the -- that
was the real intelligent judgment in the -- in this case.
Q: But how do you then find a resistance group, the partisans outside?
A: Well --
Q: Was it an accident that you came upon it?
A: Accidentally.
Q: Accid --
A: Knew -- we knew where -- we knew as we -- we -- we grew closer, we -- as we came closer to
the, you know, wooded areas, peasants gi -- you know, the peasants yi -- more or less gave us

A: Yeah.
Q: And they knew you were Jewish, of course?

did you come here? You gave the gold to -- to the Germans. In other -- you gave the -- you gave
th -- you gave the gold to the Germans, and you came here, in other words, empty handed. You
came here --
Q: Empty ha --
A: -- you came here what, to save your life, he said. Well -- and -- but, he says, well you have to
show that you really want to fight the -- back. Fight the [indecipherable]. You have no arms, so
you have to go and get arms, and you get whatever you can sabotage, whatever you can do. So
ma -- well, our guys went to start to do something, to think about something. So we send out four
different -- four different groups to show -- to go, as they say -- as they have demanded, they
have demanded to go out to get arms, or to do sabotage. So one guy from our group -- from --
who worked at the electricians, he said he’ll go back to the transformers, he’11 destroy the

the ghetto they went out to work to the police, railroad police, those who carried the prisoners
and thing, or my people are [indecipherable] to the camps, or those prison -- those have a police
force, they have a police force and they worked for them. So they -- so they go and see if they
could get some arms over there. And the third one -- the third group is just to get int -- the
information to go near the railroad, to see the -- bring the information, the movement, what kind
of -- what kind of movement it is, what cargo, military or some that. So there were fo -- and then
there’s another group which just simply -- I don’t know whether you figure to go get some arms.
And those four -- four guys, you know, they went out, they didn’t have arms with them. They
weren't armed, but they went to look for arms, which was really --
Q: So these are guys going alone?
A: Huh?
Q: These are guys going alone or in their small groups?
A: In their s -- no, alone, they --

A: So the others has way -- they have -- they have some sort of place where they could find it,
maybe they had in the mind somewheres to go where they could find some arms. And those fo-
four guys, those four guys were killed right away, out -- when they stepped -- you know, the first
-- the first -- they -- the German patrol right away killed them as soon they went out on the other
side, the outside of the camps, you know, they -- you know, an hour later, something like that.
These four gu -- and the other guy, they went wi -- to -- went to blow up the transformers, they
went -- came -- went back to the pu -- in other words, the place where we were and he was
spotted -- he was mix -- miggling -- mixing with jig -- the guy still which working there, he was
play like one of them, and then stay overnight and do his job. While he was hanging around
there, a Polish guy knew his -- that he escaped in the partisans [indecipherable] worked with the
Jewish guys and they were talking about he -- that Moishe Polak is -- is in the partisans. And
then he sees him here. He sur -- he informed the SS. And they -- they came and picked him up
and brought him for interrogation and one SS officer was sitting next [indecipherable] his table,
and nic -- is sort of asking questions. And he had a hand grenade with for -- from our group, the
guy, he pulled out the hand grenade. So the officer saw the hand grenade, he went out the room.
And he wants to blow himself up --
Q: Right.
A: -- with the hand grenade, but the hand grenade didn’t go off. So he opened the window, and
just -- he jumped out and killed himself jumping out the window.
Q: Mm. So right away it’s a tragedy, right?
A: Yeah. Boys cry [indecipherable] cry. All the others have also su -- they all succeeded, but the

A: And they, when they were killed, they had their documents on them, the -- the -- their I.D.’s.
So they knew where they worked. So went back and they had this, the SS went back to the work
-- to the place where they worked, and tried to find -- to find out how come they don’t know --
they didn’t know that they escaped. Said, when did they escape? So the -- they -- they went to
the far [indecipherable] it’s an office where they keep their registers and the files from all the
workers. And they were looking for the files for these guys, and they couldn’t find them. So they
ask these clerks, is there missing files? Well, he -- he said that Rudel, man was here, he took out
the files, say you don’t know, you know, for what reason they too -- took out. He took out and
destroyed them, like we never existed.
Q: Existed.
A: So that was -- he didn’t call -- when we escaped he didn’t alarm the SS, that’s one thing. He
didn’t go to chase us [indecipherable] us -- he was it -- and so, in other words, and then he
figured that he’ll take out the -- the files, nobody will look in -- will -- nobody will know that we
escaped. So meanwhile the SS arrested Rudel and as they -- later on the guys came, they came
after us, some of them managed to escape, the last -- the last -- the last -- from our -- from
[indecipherable] we were -- told us about that, how he was arrested and court-martialed. So I felt
I -- I felt that he [indecipherable] was talking to him that he -- he went through a tremendous
change, being that he was a devoted Nazi and could not -- he would not expect that kind of scene
which is -- you know, it could break down a lot of people, but he broke down even though he’s a
-- he was a devoted Nazi.
Q: Right.
A: It broke him down. And you know ho mak -- how much -- how strong they are what it is and
you know, but you never know is a [indecipherable] a man is just a human being

[indecipherable] could break down anybody. So that’s what the ir -- we heard of these guys who
came later, what he -- what happened to him, and he -- and he was court-martialed and
presumably -- I don’t know what -- which way, or -- it’s hard to find them. I then -- go to find --
Q: How do you spell his name, do you know?
A: What?
Q: How do you spell his name?
A: I don’t exactly know, but I 1 --
Q: Is it R-u-d-e-l? Or --
A: R-u -- R-u-d -- R-u-d-e-l
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And the -- this -- we had still a struggle and -- and the others over the -- cause this group was
very anti-Semitic, with -- the ones that were -- gave us orders to go. We had such a -- really, we
lost so many people right away, the first fr -- right in the first step, lost two -- two of the good
people. Two of this and the three [indecipherable]. And -- and the main thing is what -- is where
they were not instructed how t-to do it, how to go. They were strange, you know, and they -- out
from the woods, they know -- they didn’t know if you can go by a daytime or at night. You
know, some of them go dangerous places, you don’t go in broad daylight, you -- you wait until --
til it’s getting dark, or complete night. They were not giving instructions at all, they just send
them out to be killed or something like that.
Q: So what happened in that group? Did you stay there, or did you folks leave?
A: Fa -- we didn’t stay long with them, because they were really very -- like whole group were
really -- like how could I say, they -- they told us -- they ma -- called them ex-convicts. I mean,

They really let [indecipherable] we could not stay there longer, but was -- they were robbing us,

A: Yeah, the -- we have a leader what -- he couldn’t do much. [indecipherable] have a leaders,
you have two leaders, you have a co -- a few guys which are sort of in the leadership sure. Well,
they were still in the -- in the ghetto, there were leaders, so they -- some of them were still

A: -- of different groups, lot of groups. So they moved towards us, they were going to go further
e -- further east. So some of the groups also split up. There was a -- a Jewish group, what with a
Russian com -- commander, so we figured well maybe it’s a good -- so we got the idea to go. We
have to leave anyhow, this area is -- couldn’t stay longer.
Q: Right.
A: And so we -- we managed to merge with them. And --

brigades and they broke up in the smaller groups because they been running from -- they been
going east, so they couldn’t go in one big brigade, there were a few hundred people. So they
broke up these small groups, and in this one was a Jewish group and we -- we -- some of them

Q: And who was the leader of that group? Was there a leader?
A: They had a leader, they have a -- they had a Russian leader.
Q: A Russian leader?

commanding us, why don’t you meet with these guys, the Gorkinsens and tell them why the --
and ask them why did they kill people when they come from the ghetto? So he met with this
commander there, Tsygankov and he says, why do you kill th -- all Jewish people, they come
from the ghetto. So he says, don’t worry, if Pll kill a hundred -- a hundred Jews, and one of --
and one would have been a spy, I would be f -- I would be justified. That’s a -- that’s the answer

Belarussian militia in there, they teamed up with the German SS, and they raided our camp,

Q: Okay, we left off and you said you were left alone, that this -- this guy just left you by
yourselves again, right? Or you decided to leave? The second group. The second -- the second
resistance group you were in.
A: The second, when we merged with the other group?
Q: Yes, but then -- then you split from them, right? Cause this guy, th-the guy who seemed not to
be anti-Semitic became anti-Semitic.
A: Oh, the -- Pugachov. That -- it was something that -- we went back -- we still had a Jewish
group in existence, I mean, since they went back -- they went, they left people and they left the
gr -- us, and were -- now, who does that? They have -- the g -- the group originally, which was a
s -- was sort of dismantled because you had a raid and people were running in different
directions, til they grouped together it took a long time, couple weeks because you spread out
who knows where, because it was a big raid. Took a couple days until they burned the village,
and took a few days and they were -- we were spreading out in the depths from the woods
somewheres. We didn’t know how fa -- long they stay, but they were -- tried to go back, but they
were still stay -- the German forces were thi -- still in the village for a few days, you know, that’s
unheard of -- it was unheard of til then, how long they stayed, they want to clean up -- clean out
this area. So -- but this commander of this group Pugachov is a Russian guy, and he start ta --
taking -- getting in more people like from the Russian prisoners -- Russian guys, prisoners,
escaped prisoners. And -- and there were s -- they were anti-Semitic, and they sort of talked them

Q: [indecipherable]
A: So to [indecipherable] against -- well, it turned out they eliminate Jewish people because they
were the majority, and -- and they [indecipherable] the things to be there, they had the
commander, he gave them everything. He was like a big -- big commander, do -- do nothing. So
then there was a -- a call to go east, partisans should group east wa -- i-in deep -- deeper
[indecipherable] because they could group together bigger units -- bigger partisan brigades, so
they, because the German -- four German battalions were really active in -- in raids, and they
figure if they th -- if they were grouped together, they still be stronger resistance and they would
not be able to eliminate these group. So he delayed that call til -- delayed until finally after the
raid, and these two fr -- fre -- couple friends, the Russian escapees talked them in and say, he got
-- he gotta do something, in other words, so he left. Half of the group behind it -- he
[indecipherable] from the old -- his old Jewish friends, the others, and the Russians, guys, and he
took off east, he left us alone. We had eight -- four rifles -- four rifles, very little arms. In other
words, we were a lot of pe -- we were 36 people, something. And we tried to stay and maintain
whatever we could do, try to get some contact, we couldn’t -- we couldn’t find any contact with
any other groups. So we’re by ourselves. But the Gorkinsens, these were after us. They want to
get rid of us in that area. They don’t want us in this area because it’s their -- their area, they say
it’s their territory.
Q: So the -- the partisans want to get rid of you.
A: Yeah, it’s the Russian -- the Gorkinsens, yeah.

command of this operation, he says he wants to look through the arms, everybody should check
their arms. So he -- they let them check their arms, but they never gave back. They rob their arms
in a nice way, in a nice way, in a tricky way. In a tricky way they robbed the arms, and the --
when they came home without arms, we say that -- that’s the end of us. We have no choice now,
we -- I don’t know, we have to do something. Well, it was t -- it was tough without arms, we
couldn’t -- without arms you can’t -- can’t even get food, you know. So we waited. In
meanwhile, the -- the -- the river was flowing and the camps a way -- and our camp was sort of
getting more water and water, you see? Soon enough, we’ll probably -- we’ll have to be stuck or
can’t go further, or we’ll go s-sinking here, because the water is coming in fast. So this
commander, he send out two guys, two in different direction -- two in the one direction, and me
and -- I went out with my friend Jonathan in one direction to look a way out. If you don’t -- we
always had the river for the road, but we have to find a way to go beside the river to get out of
this area -- of this swamp -- of this swampy area or something. So I have -- I have been good at
that, I always have -- went out scouting, and I went out with my friend Jonathan and well
[indecipherable] a couple hours looking around the area, how to get to -- out -- to make a way

on the different direction, they should look in that direction. And I came back to reported this, we
have a good way out and that’s all, we could simp -- not difficult to get out from here. Found still
a dry way -- dry land to go out. The other two guys took a little longer time to come back.
Couldn’t ra -- didn’t [indecipherable] whether they got lost or something [indecipherable]. They
got lost, they got a little wandering around a little bit. They couldn’t find it. They came back --
they couldn’t find anything out. They couldn’t find a way out. [indecipherable]. As we sitting

we’re looking a way out. Yeah, but to him -- you gotta explain to him, he wouldn’t take -- come
along. As they walked out, two minutes later, two shots. So we -- this [indecipherable] our
commander said well, tomorrow morning we have to go. It’s no -- it’s no use to stay here, it’s no

morning to get out, two guys are here [indecipherable] again from them, two other guys and they
make sure that we -- that we are moving out. They watched us going, so they went back to
[indecipherable]. Going on, we had no place where to go, cause everything -- everywhere is
dangerous. You know, sort of being pushed out to the edge, to the -- and we could not -- we find
a place we stayed at -- we stayed a couple days in a place, we says it isn’t temporary -- it isn’t
steady, but temporary, wait until we find the pet -- permanent place. But again they showed up,
more than one, more than two, the whole group. And -- and we sort of -- so we had -- we left
together, we had -- each one had two hand grenades. We had the hand grenades, Russian hand
grenades. So you had them in the belts here, two hand grenades. So they figured we don’t have
arms, they finish -- they finish off us. They -- they want to finish -- there was -- they took arms

settle -- where you settled. You know, made themself in good friends. Good friends. And they
left. They saw the -- saw the hand grenades, they didn’t want to start a war. Anyhow, we went
further, what you say, again [indecipherable] decide it’s not the place to stay, because they will --
they’ll be coming in here and there. If not today, they will come tomorrow again. So we moved
further out.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: We moved out to a -- almost to the end of the partisan zone, you know, it’s almost -- very
close to the German patrols, okay? And over there we stayed a few -- couple days, and it ha --
