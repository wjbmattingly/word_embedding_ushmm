RALPH CODIKOW
April 20, 1990

Q: Would you tell me your name please?

A: My name is Ralph Codikow.

Q: Where and when were you born?

A I was born April 9th, 1930, in Kovno, Lithuania and lived in Panemon, Lithuania all my
life until I was 11 years old.

Q: Where is Panemon in relation to Kovno?

A: Panemon is on the outskirts of Kovno.

Q: Ralph, would you tell me about your parents and about your family?

A: Well, we were an average family in Lithuania before the war and...uh...my father, mother
and a brother. I had a brother who was 7 years older than I was. And my father was in the
...lumber business and lived there with his father, grandfather that I know oflived in
Lithuania. Before that I don't know.

Q: Okay. What was your childhood like growing up?

A: Well, it was a pretty happy childhood. I went to eider when I was about 6 years old, then
at 7 I went to Hebrew gymnasium which is a high schoot until about...until I was about
10 years old. And then in 1940...

Q: Hold it one second. Before we get to 1940, tell me a little bit about...uh...the friends you
had, the things you did during the day as a child.

A: Well, it was...it was an average life. We had a...we lived in a nice town. Panemon was a
small community. It consisted of one long street with a few alleys. And it was the
gateway to which were...were summer homet3 B for the people who lived in Kovno.
They used to come over to spend their weekends in the woods and the forests where they
had built summer homes. Also was real close by and it was beautiful beach and we used
to spend our weekends there and it was real nice before the war. And then in 1940, when
the Russians took over Lithuania..*uh...we didn't have any more Hebrew schools and we
had to go to Yiddish schools and that's when we started g ~ learning Yiddish. I think
Hebrew was outlawed or something. And I studied there for | year in a different school
until the Germans came in. And...well...uh...we could talk a little bit...uh...about that one
year.

Q: Ya. Tell us about that. Well, uh my father had to leave his business because uh you
couldn't be a businessman under the _â€”_ Russian regime, and he tried to get a job several
times and had difficulties because he didn't belong to any party, and he was not involved
in politics. And being...having been in business before the war, it was a little difficult to
get a job. So we kind of struggled through that year, but it wasn't too bad. We made it.
And...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took over, that's when all Hell broke loose,
so to speak. Uh...First of all, I remember like it was yesterday. It was on a Sunday
morning. And I had sat up until 4:00 in the morning making some names for my...for
my...for the uniforms of my basketball team. I was about |4years and I was...at 4:00 in
the morning when I was extremely tired I went to bed. And at 6:00 in the morning, I was
woken and told that the Germany invaded Russia and they're going to be in our town any
day, the German army, and we have to leave because that may save our lives. So we had
a horse and wagon. My father...uh...got it all together and we packed some of our
belongings and took all...took my ...well, my whole family which consisted of my
brother, my mother and my father and also my grandfather from my mother's side. And
we just started toward Russia. Uh...We...I don't remember exactly how long it took us...a
day or so to get to a small town. I believe that town was where my father was born and I
think it was named...I'm not really very sure. And that is when the Germans met us and
the border was closed, and there was no need to go any further. So we walked into the
first abandoned home we found, probably was a Jewish home, other people who ran
away, and we decided to stay overnight and see what happens the next day. And in the
meantime, I remember...uh...a few hours later, we heard some knocks on the doors,
vicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they were looking for Jewish people I believe.
They were yelling there were any Jews hiding here and naturally, we admitted that we
were Jewish. So I remember they were kind of...a little vulgar and then they
asked...uh...what time it was. One incident, and my brother kind of being proud of his Bar
Mitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch and told him what time it was. They
said, "Well, give me that watch immediately." And my brother kind of resisted, so when
the Germans start pulling up his rifle, my mother went over grabbed his watch...grabbed
my brother's watch and just handed it over real fast. And this was our first introduction to
the German army Then the next day, I believe, we saw that there was no use to hang
around. There was no use to stay in that little town. We still had our horse, our wagon
and some of our belongings and we headed back home back to Panemon, through Kovno.
On the road, they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a place where
they intercepted all the refugees who had tried to leave and tried and kept them...stopped
all of us and told us to move over to that particular, big huge place it was on the road.
And they just kept us there for no reason at all. We...we spent a few nights there I believe
outside on the ground, sky. It wasn't too bad. It wasn't cold...cold. It was summertime.
And no...no one knew what the future's going to bring. But after that I remember...1
believe that they took us to the Seventh or drove us to the Seventh the whole family.
Exactly I don't remember how it happened, but I remember that our next stop was the
Seventh Fort in Lithuanian.

Q: Tell us about the Seventh Fort.

A: Well, the Seventh port was, I believe, an army base before the war. It may have been
some kind of a military defense area or something like that, but it was pretty
green...pretty and they separated immediately the men and the women. Uh...I remember
that my brother was 7 years older than I was, and when my grandfather went with my
father on my one side, and my mother and I...they took us in another area of the Seventh
Fort. I was 11 years old at that time. And we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of
days...I don't remember how many days we spent there, but I...1 remember that right
before they took us to the Ninth Fort, and the Ninth Fort was a similar place as the
Seventh Fort in Lithuania, they had given them an order to some of the
younger...uh...younger people who were with the meant to...to go to the women's side,
and I...someone told you...that I think the order was that all the children up to about 15 or
16 could go to the women's side and my brother tried to go over. I don't know, he
probably thought maybe it is safer and my father may have told him to do
60.And...uh...they didn't let him through because they said he looked older. Actually, he
was 18. And he looked older, and they didn't let him in...let him go to...to...uh...his
mother. And...and right after that we heard and knew that everyone was shot over there.
All the men were shot, but my father was not there. This is another long story. My father
was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army. I believe when Lithuania in 1916 or something
like that, he volunteered in the Lithuanian army to defend the...the country. And while
Lithuania was independent between 1916 and I believe1940, these volunteers took a in
certain prominent Close Lithuanian life. They were ...and they were honored many times.
My father had medals of it, and we were pretty proud of it. Uh...So before they told all
the youngsters or after to go to another side, to the women's side, they also announced
that everyone who was...they called themselves and those are volunteers. Every man who
was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh.,
soldiers who probably did the massacre afterwards, and that they would take them out of
there. And indeed, they did. They took them to a different place, which was called
the...the Yellow Prison. They called it the Yellow Prison in Kovno. And I know that my
father was there. So at that time my father was not shot. It was only my brother and my
grandfather. Then the...and....uh...my father was...uh...in that prison I remember. And
later on when we were released from the Ninth Fort, after being there...uh...and..-uh...my
father came home one day and...uh...he...we asked him how he did that. He was in prison.
And he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go
to see his family. He said, "Well, I'll let you go, but you better be back." And my father
came to visit us. He spent a few hours with us and my mother begged him, I remember
that. She begged him not to go back because it's not going to be there very good place.
We knew about that. And...uh...he did go back, and...uh...they were shot over there also.
They were shot. We heard all kinds of stories. Who knows why? But, we really don't
know why. We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were
and respected before the war, the Lithuanian army who really directed most of
these...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free, but
they didn't. Uh...well, after...after this, we...uh...went to the ghetto. They...when the
orders came, they told the Jews have to leave their towns...their towns and homes and
belongings. Well, not all the belongings, but...uh...that you couldn't take with you and
move to that designated area around Kovno which was called the ghetto. And my mother
and I...we just took the things that we had. Couldn't...tried to exchange our home with

some Lithuanians, but I guess we just were not successful. Some people did. Some
people gave up big mansions for little homes, and...uh...they moved in there, but there
was not enough room for everyone so they...people who had those homes took in their
families, their friends, whoever needed it, and we were sharing. I and my mother, we
shared a room with a neighbor of ours who...uh...was...we were close before the war
and...uh...that lady had also lost her son and her husband, and her daughter, who was my
brother's age and I think they were friends...uh...had a room that they acquired somehow
from some relatives or friends in one of those houses, and they took us in and we...shared
one room, the four of us.

Q: Can you...can you go back. You had told me before that while your father was in prison
your mother had taken his papers and tried to do something?

A: Yes. Well...well, my mother always cherished papers, a being the, that volunteers...and
his medals. And that was...we tell that was a precious thing because most of the...most of
our encounter all the misfortunes that we had until then were always caused by
Lithuanian soldiers. And we didn't see that many Germans around at the beginning. I'm
sure they gave all the orders. They were involved. But I we didn't see them. So we
felt...she felt especially that those papers and medals may come in handy someday. She
always kept them on her. Uh...Well...there's so much to talk about...

Q: You had gone ahead and you are in the ghetto now?

A: Yes, I'm in the ghetto now. But...uh...there was another incident that if I may I should
back up a little but that's always stuck with me too is when...when the Russians came in,
although we were not in great shape financially either, but my father since he was a
volunteer and he was in the army, he kind of had respect for some...for the Lithuanian
Army...for the Lithuanian army before the war. And he was friendly with
some...uh...people in high command. And he find out where we lived there a general who
was I think the Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian army and when the Russians came in they
sent him to Siberia. And...and he had left his wife and children in our town, and my
father knew them. And I remember that whenever he could, he used to take some
packages over there or even lumber to heat the homes because in Lithuania most of the
homes were heated by lumber, good lumber. And he...he was quite friendly with them
and tried to help that particular year. And right after the Germans occupied Lithuania
right before the ghetto, we were sitting in this lady's house, Mrs. Mudrick was her name,
and...uh...just talking about the future in the ghetto and things like that, where we're going
to move homes or whatever and I...I looked through the window. It, it was about two
houses away from ours in Panemon, and I looked through the window and here was the
General walking with his wife and was going back to their home in the...on the... They
lived...they had a home in the outskirts of Panemon. And I kind of felt a great feeling
because I felt this is one man who probably could help release my father from that
Yellow prison that he was in. And I pointed her out to my mother, "Look who's walking
by here. Why don't you go out and talk to him really quickly. I'm sure he knows us.
Especially...she knows us, and maybe they can do something," my mother went out real
quick. I was with her and I remember that for a minute they acted like...like...they didn't

even know us or pretended anyway. And...uh...she told them who we were and they
nodded and she begged them to see if theyâ€™I...can do something about releasing my
father. But needless to t say, nothing happened. That is one incident that stayed with me.
Uh...Alright, I guess now the next thing is the ghetto.

Q: Tell us again which ghetto you were in and how did you get there?

A: Well, from what I remember it was quite simple. We just walked or...or took a bus or
something. I really don't remember exactly how we got there. Maybe on a wagon? No, I
cannot. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I know that we were there in 1941, and I was!1 years
old with my mother and she had arranged to live in that room with Mrs. Widrick and her
daughter, Rita.

Q: You are not in Kaunas. You are in Kovno.

A: Well, Kaunas and Kovno is the same thing. Kaunas is in Lithuania. Uh, well, from the
beginning, I remember there was Aktions. They called for 500 people, and they called
four thousand people to work, and they called for all kinds of things. And some came
back, some people didn't come back, but those things did...did not affect me personally
because, as I said, you know, being young, you...you don't understand a lot of things. I
12 know...my...my mother used to go to work every day in a brigade. I don't remember
exactly what she was doing and, but then we tried...we tried our best to survive.

Q: Did you see any of the roundups?

A: Uh...Not, not exactly. I seen a lot of roundups. Iseena _ lot of brigades going in and
out, but...uh...there â€” weren't...I could not distinguish between the ones who went and
came back and the ones who went and didn't come back. Uh I was a go-for when I was
about 12, 13 years old, I became a go-for for the administration in the ghetto.. running
around with papers, back and forth to offices...And...uh...I thought maybe...I really don't
remember what I was thinking. I...I was just doing what I was told to do,
After...and...and that's it. When I was about 14 I believe, I started to work in a...in a
clay factory where weQ 5 * 2 used to manufacture pottery, clay...out of clay. And that
factory was run by afamily of qenerations of...of pottery makers, and they were very
experienced and dida very beautiful job.;5 ft

Q: Okay. Let's just pause. We need to change tapes.AtZ <e Xtal

Q: Tell us about your >**ning.- < > Qvlve I t(a ew13

A: Well...uh...so, | was doing some running for that place, running around, delivering to
the pottery, and also trying __ to help out with the clay, kneading clay and so on and so
t forth. A avery important uh part of my life happened in that factory. When I
worked there, I'm sure that's whenX the... F st of the people know about the children's
aktionSwhich was the selection of the young children whomthey...they picked out from
the ghetto and took to the Ninthb ffi rt and killed them all over there.

As...as...uh...weheard, I was...the day they hAd that selection, I was at thepottery, at the
ceramic factory. And I guess the boss orthe leader of that factory had heard that there's
ata selection...they're rounding up all the children. Well, hewas kind of concerned about
me...uh...and he said, "Well, wegonna...since they're rounding up children we're going
to;:ao put you to work and make you look important. So let's seeif...what we can do about
it." I don't know...I don't knowif I understood what was happening, what our destiny
was,but he all of a sudden put me next to his old uncle who wast 9 @t the best pottery
maker, a real artist, and he put me rightnext to him to knead...knead the clay to prepare
the clay ..for him to put on that machine and he was making the pots and vases and things
likethat. And I remember two~3 ;6tUkrainian soldiers walked in. They looked around.
They didn't see any children untilthey spotted me. And they walked up to me and they
said, "How old are you?" And! â€˜14 believe I said, "I was about 14." Maybe I was 15.
Maybe I was 14." And onesaid to me, "Come with us." Wellt Ir3 ;au didn't move that fast.
I just kept on working, and the other one looked at me andsaid, "Aw, let him stay." "Oh
no." "Let him go. Let him go. Come on. Come on." AndWz Ssthen the...the boss, Ske
name i~ Nicholas, and he intervened and said, "Well, this is a real good worker
and we need him here. n And he said, "Okay, let's leave him here. wJ And the
second one insisted that I stay, and they walked away and _ t__ this is how I remained
that timt and uh this was an0 4 60important...uh...event, that clay factory. I think
stayed in the clay factory untilthe evacuation to the concentration camps in Germany. But
I think before that...beforethe clay factory, we had a very importantO<ab Aktion...an
incident happened. And that was what they called the big Aktion, thebig selection where
this particular day the German commandant selected 10,000 peopleO4 4b and they were
all exterminated in one day in the Ninth Kort. And this is quite a story.Uh...They told us
to present ourselves at 6:00 in the morning at a certain place intheghetto. The
whole...everyone...whoever would stay behind ..O $ tt would be shot, and naturally
everybody showed up. They...they put everybody in thegates...and some type of Jewish
police and...uh...and the leaders of the ghetto triedto keep some kind of order, so as to try
to present us in Io S ;=b guess a better light, and so not to upset the Germans, you 15
know, when...when we walked in front of them. I remember walking up in front of
the German Gestapo men with my mother loxclt 06 s~\l. and he asked my
mother questions, says , "No men?" And my mother said, "No." And he says,
Well, he pointed to the right. And as he pointed to the right, log 61D knew right
then and there that was death. That was the end of us. And...uh...I remember we
started crying and we __ started worrying. And...uh...my mother told me in the
convoys, "Don't worry. We'll be back. We r re not going toU D go anywhere." And I
thought she's really out of her mind. And...uh..~because that wasunheard of. Once they
decided something, there's no coming back. And...uh...she toldme,# ll she said...we
had...we had a friend...and this is another story. We had a friend,Lithuanian, before the
war who was a German-Jew, a refugee from Germany. And he usedto come over to our
house and be friendly with us, with my parents. And he in 1940,was = out by the
Russians as a O8 ; 4 olitical prisoner. He escaped, came back toLithuanian, and had some
papers as if..if he was some political prisoner and againstcommunism. And he was in
ghetto. We knew that.o7 aO We used to see him. And she told me, "We're going to meet
him on this side, andtogether with his papers and our papers, we're going to come back."
My father'smedals...what I was talking about. "We're going to come back." And again,

I...Ididn't...I didn't know what to a_ think. I thought my mother had lost her sind right
there. | 4;rS; oF Il \ tt~i~IL h. To find him on the wrong side since he was,
poFtiswbartywas I think a single person. I don't think he had his familyO g a anymore.
Well, to shorten it, they took us down about, oh, 50 yards or 100 yards ina different place
after we were selected on the right side which was the wrong sideand...uh...they were
waiting for more people to come and when they had a certainamount...on that side they
usedot:2~ to...they took us into the little ghetto. And that is different...altogetherdifferent
story about the little ghetto. Well, as we were standing there and waitingto be taken to the
little ghetto, I spotted that man standingt Mabout 10 yards from us and said to my mother,
"Here he is just like you 8aid." And shesays, "Run over to him and tell him to come over
and stay with us." And I did. Andhe kind of worked his way to us. My mother asked him,
"How did you get over here?"Well, I tried to save a lot of people,O 9'6~ children,
and...and the commandant wouldn't even listen to me. He just put us on thewrong side
and here we are." And he was just as scared and just as weak as I was.My motherW)S
4tÂ«Oq Lao said, "Let's stay together. Wsw'ra going with UL,J~ Well, we went to the
littleghetto which was empty, which was...which was exterminated before and as we
camethere...uh...there...uh...10,000 people were there at night.t5,+t Ten thourand people
were selected. And some thought that they may just separate usfrom the big ghetto and let
us stay there and maybe live or do other things. So sone _17 people tried to get their
homes and get some beds to be ableD 9 to sleep on or whatever was left from the people
who were there before. And my mothersaid, "We're not looking for no houses. We are
not going to look for any furniture.We don't need anything. We want to come back to the
ghetto. nÂ¢: ao Because she doesntt like the situation here. So as she saidwe picked one
house right...right by the gate. 1remember \>;Â«d~S ~ that we found some berrivie
room and there was an oldmattress...mattress on which Mr. h was his name, Mr. R*6tu~
and I laid down and sleptand my mother sat in aqD lounge chair all night long and I thin
S tt8>, M# ,r Jke aOlr something. And everytime I woke up I could see her sitting, not
sleeping at all. At 6:00 in the morning,5:00,X1~O-D 6:00 in the morning, we heard bang
gr~yelling, screaming, insults, dragging people.We ran out and we saw already
some...uh...rows of humanity being taken I think in theX] aj) direction of the Ninth Fort
which we knew...which street led to the Ninth Fort. Andas we were in the line in front,
almost by the gate, my mother decided, she said,"Well, now __ ttr. X h we're going to try
to come back." She said, "Ba , give/{ 4t me your papers." And she took the medals and
my father's .. paper and she ran up to oneLithuanian officer and told him that...pretended
that Mr. Raston was her husband andsaid that he was a political prisoner, that he was a, a
volunteer before the war,that he did some good things forXD LithuaniaÂ«, and would he
help us in...in sending us back to _i8 the big ghetto. Well, one...one said, "Well, don't
worry wherever you'regoing you're going to be working. You're...you're just going to
change places. Itwon't be/; ;UD much different." And she went to another one. Another
one wouldn't even listen toher. The third one said I could not do anything about it, until
Mr. iesCcn and I kindof gave up and told herl "Let's...let's go where everyone else goes."
/; And uh. she said, "One more." She saw _ she spotted thislieutenant, Lithuanian
lieutenant, and she walked up to himand she kind of with her last breath tried to explain
the} 3 ' 6M situation. And he said to her, "Look, I cannot do anything about it, but...but

andhe put us on the sidewalk, rather than in the streets. And he said, ~You stay here

andwhen the German commandant comes, we're going to present to him these papers and
seewhat he can do} 3 aU3 about it." And that felt very tood at that moment except that
about a minute later,some soldier walked up, Lithuanian soldier, and he saw us standing
on...on thesidewalk, not where everyone else was standing. And he had, 3: q O a club in
his hand and without any question he smacked Mr. ..9*6ten on his ear and split his ear
and...uh...my mother on her back, black and bluemarks on her back, and told us to get
back in the row with all the other people. Atthat time # ffi that officer noticed it and he
came over and he said to him, "Look, Itold them to stay here and I want them to stay here
19 and don't touch them." A minute later the German appeared, the Germancommandant.
And the way it was situated was like/ 4 ag3 this. The gate of the small ghetto was the end
of one street. The whole thinghappened...the way it happened was like a interception
from which four or fivestreets...streets branched out. The German commandant wastX 40
standing in the middle of the interception. The gate was on one street. About 90degrees
of that gate was the fence of the big ghetto from which we had come. No gate.3ust barbed
wire fence with German guards and the Jewish policea ff n an the other side of it,
pretending to watch what'shappening or to guard or whatever they were doing there. aÂ»a
Xs Probably seeing what was happening. knothes German was J b SLt standing
there,the lieutenant ran over quickly, took the medal the papers, and walked over to
theGerman commandant and he talked to hiw. What he said I don't know, but I heard
theGerman yell, "Where are those Jews? Where are those Jews?" So he ran...he came
overquickly and got us and...uh...my mother walked up to him quickly and told...ff 40
repeated her story, and he said, "Back in the ghetto." And we could see...before I gotto
the fence, I could see the 3ewish police...there was no entrance, but the Jewishpolice16;
65r who were on the other side tore the barbed wire with their hands and their feet,tore
apart...made a hole, and we just crawled back in. And...uh...that day 10,000people
died.sUD One of the nen who vent was a cousin who we really hadn't 20 seen, but we
learned afterwards that she was there. And...uh...this is, Iguess, how we survived that
one.g q p But...uh...it just worked out exactly the same way my mother ~1,8,~8 zr~
predicted. - ~ . Probably one in a million. From what I understand is thatthere may have
been a few othersIn C~) who hid in attics or some other places that day instead of going
to the Ninth Fort,and I think when somebody told me afterwards...when the Jewish police
and the firemencame i io check they found some people hidden and later got them out of
there. Theybrought over uniforms and they dressed n a>Dthem up as policemen and they
just gotthem back in.I  FaP S>ftdon't think there was very many, but I know
that...uh...thatAo*WenQwe came back, we were the only ones.O

Q: Where did you go? What happened to you?

A: Yes. And uh the ghetto kept on shrinking all the time,21 less and less people.
And even the area was reduced and I believe in 44 when the Russian army got
closer to Lithuania, X for sone reason and just evacuated us and took us to
theconcentration camp. But before that happened...uh...peoplewere trying...trying to build
some bunkers~ They werecalled bunkers, which were hiding pl*ces. They kind of5 C1D
expected that some day when the war was over that theGermans would not leave a trace
of U8. SO they builtbunkersX And in that ceramic factorA there was a bunker.And
actually I...I forgot to mentionXmy mother was hidden in; q that bunker in the ceramic
factory. And...uh...from what Iunderstand Gb*Ae was later that...when they evacuated
theghetto and some of the people stayed in the bunker, they;4 D just put the whole...they
just put a fire to the ghetto andthey burned everything and everyone in there. And I
don'tknow if any people survived that day. But I know there wassome people hidden in
this bunker. They had it prepareda ~: r real well. They pretended they were building a
furnace...afurnace...0 oven for the ceramic because you had to take it utsst Dv 15 iZq
and burn it. And that was the ; fEceceee 11ve in-the big bunker. AndI think I know...1
think I heard that one of my aunts also was in one of those bunkers and she
disappeared ffi right afterw~>~

Q: What was life likeAfor you in the ghetto?22

A: Well, it all depends. It all depends. It was different for all people. For me7 Well,when I
was working...running a â€œ so around and working, it wasn't that bad. Matteroffact...uh...I
even had a chance to play soccer in the te~_ a1 6mb ghetto. I had a PtSBt.I had some
friends. We formed a soccer team. We played there among ours Qlvesand...uh...and
..uh...as a matter of fact, I had a good friend who was the captain of our team. He was
studying at that time...incidently, we had a...I believe an arts school in a o . a O the
ghetto. And that arts school consisted of about four or five students, one or Mwo
\teachers. And...uh...they were0 iC OC c .1 < 9 0 (0 o ~ ag=wsug some veedbeSteatA.
training. And one of the friend of ~ine heard that we were studying in this arts school and
1Q 1 qb remember waiting for me and rushing him to get out of school so we could have a
little more time to play and...uh...later on this arts school played another big part in my
life. Uh...Otherwise I really don't remember too much. It was>;L ~nb just routine every
day. I remember one incident when my mother went to work and she took me with...with
her because she got a chance to go to home ~ in Panemon because the brigade was
working there for... don't know who...theQ; g D military or somebody. And I remembert
we went and came to our hometown and we walked into the barracks, the military
barracks which was situated behind a home across the street from our house. And the
people across the street from ouraa +~ house were Lithuanians, very good friends of ours.
They had 23 a restaurant and I remember walking through...uh...I think she had
made...Ithink Oer mother ~w walkeda 3 crD through several times and there was a board
in the fence that was loose, especially made I think for my mother to go over the board
and walk through to their backyard and into their home. And I remember those people
real well. Weofl v se>4 M *v RÂ» s aUL walked through there and we walked up nnd
otood boforc this restaurant and I remember that lady was there, Mrs. , friends before the
war. They were very nice to me. Andused to be our friends before the war, her sons, and
even made one time at iaSi~ r;*S forme, amsttk , a very small one. It was very cold. And

they poured water, used toa3 q b freeze them within an hour. And they were good friends
of ours. And I remember that they kind of helped us a little bit with some food. I
remember when my mother used to come back from that job, I remember we ate pretty
good. This was Q _ amaid sharing this food. remember during my during my stay
in the ghetto, in the concentration camp, most of thetime I spent thinking about this food
more than anythingelse. I don't think I wa6 that scared to die or anythingaW No else, just
tried to get some food just to feel better..That...that I remember. Is there anything else.
After this...

Q: You are back in the ghetto. What happened to you?24ad: 5 t

A: Well. To me? Nothing that.. nothing that I can remember! XtAte cllJâ„¢@V~c- 'ts MoR Mir
. The big aktionQ I believe I ~\; J 13 was 12 years old. i~_S*Â«S, I even had my Bar
Mitzvah in the ghetto. Yes. | remember that. We had (laughing) we had some other
friends who were also German refugees who came to tSo; & live in Panemon in B~ d
right before the Germans occupied.

Q: Let's hold it a minute. They need to change tapes. j 3CX5 3m

Q: Would you tell us about your familyÂ«? g Ow_ xt5<~1 t7

A: Prom what I remember was this. There were no schools inthe school in the ghetto. If
there were any, I didn't know _ about it. Uh...We had some friends as I said who came
from...who also were German-Jewish refugees who came to live ol ; | in Panemon and
my parents became friends of theirs. And __ they were religious people, very religious
people, and...uh...tbere were all the Jewish traditions andso Ol~q O forth. They
also made it to the ghetto. And remember when I was about 12, 12 and a half, my
mother...uh...said that this gentleman...I forgot his name...would teach me the
Sa orah and everything that one needs to know to havea Bar o Mitzvah. So every
day he used to come over. I used to go over to his place and we would study4*F 1 I
don't remember how long, but...uh...but by the time the day of the Bar Mitzvah came, I
remember there was a house and there were25D z ; D quite a few people, 10, 20 and I
remember the women being in d,~ the back and...uh...they were styihq their Saturday
prayerd g ust like in the normal times, and when it came to my paronks I remember that I
think I did fairly well with myuL ~< =~. And one thing I can remember that day, I had
neverO)'457 seen my mother cry so hard and that day, it was...it was I remember it was
impossible to stop her. Although> @; a after...after the Bar Mitzvah, they had a little
party.Whoever had anything brought over, and we managed to03 a 3 celebrate. That was
one incident I remember clearly.And...uh.*.in the ghetto every day life, work and we
heard, of course, all kind of incidents. If 1 were to go to very day life, there was a hanging
in the ghetto that I remembero 3;%5 clearly because...uh...uh...one...they...they claimed
they found in fact, one of the inmates with a revolver or a pistol trying to smuggle into
the ghetto. & And uh natura}ly the Gestapo apprehended him and uh we
were ordered everyone was ordered to appear in one place. And the gallows were all
prepared ~ They brought him back. I remember having seen him coming out of the = all
beaten up, swollen, hardly recognizable, andI.. 0 remember the hanging incident. I

was maybe 12, 13 watching through a window because...uh...they had him $4; a pistol or
something. And I believe because of that...the # +O ghetto had to sacrifice a lot of people
for him because they wanted to punish US and took some innocent people and just
26Wtg t3 did kill them Xe=roTth of that incident. It was not...it was not pleasant. You
had to move from place to place. As they were shrinking the ghetto, we had to move from
place to place. And...uh...tried to do the best...make the best of it. 1 am sure that there
were a lot of other incidents thatt6 '2 thappened. I'll probably think of them later, but right
now I cannot think of them.

Q: What happened then? Do you remember? 90

A: Well, when...when they evacuated us. We were one of the last ones to be evacuated, to
Germany, to the concentration camps. They took us in a train. We traveled to Germany. I
don't know. I don't remember how long it was. But I remember coming to Stutthof and
uh and they separated the women from the men and...uh...kept the women in the
Stuffhof camp someplace around Stutthof and the men they took to Landsberg.
Landsberg was a...was the first stop in t Germany. That was a concentration camp.
A small one I believe not far from Munich and not far from Dachau. And I
remember being separated with my mother already and I justO G qocontinued with the
trains to deeper into Germany. And that __ is the last time I heard of my mother until
after the war. I had some people who were with her and told me that she _ died in the
last days of the war. The exact details they | O 5 CDnever told me, but...uh...probably
for some reason probably 27 not to upset me or other things, but the exact way I
don't know, but I know she...she died in the last days. And...uh...I came to Landsberg, and
there were a lot of men, young men and older men. And we stayed there not too long, and
they ordered all the children up to 17 years old to q O assemble and...uh...and they took
us away. They took us away to...to Dachau. We were about 131 I believe, and we stayed
in Dachau for | week and then they shipped us out to Birkenau, Auschwitz, Birkenau.
And...uh...when we came to Birkenau....

Q: Tell us about that ride.Ot

A: Well, the ride to Birkenau. We were...we were put in three wagons, three railroad
wagons, train wagons, 131 ofusand D we we were stopping someplace. The only
thing I really remember from that ride is that we came to a place in a train station where
some Russian prisoners were able to walkup to our train and there were some port holes
in our cattleOg # 513 trains and warned US to see and try to...try to escape if we could
because...uh...they said if you are Jewish and youare.. going to Auschwitz or
Birkenau, that's where they kill them Oq Â» D all. So if you have a chance, just run away.
And some of us couldn't . And it...it took quite a while to get there. And one incident I
remember was that since we>q # O were all Lithuanian children that none of us spoke
Polish so _28 to try to escape was useless or we wouldn't know to talk or how to talk.
Butin my...in my wagon, there were two boys who did speak Polish, a little or a lot I don't
know. I knew they knew something about it. And they told us that a they were going to
jump and escape. Now, we hada big _â€”_ dilemma because if they escaped and we knew
from the ghetto 1b Qdifone did anything wrong, all of us would be done. So we

had a plan made up with them thst they...we would try __ to...there were two older
German guards in that train, and = we would try to distract them to try...there were
maybe 60 qOofus or 50 of US on that train, and we would try...there | was
only...the was only made of about we were maybe about 5 or 10 kids involved in that.
And...uh...we said like this, that they're going to go through that port hole, _tnD try to
climb down the step of the train and stay there for awhile until maybe the moment that
the train slows down a little bit...I believe the train was going about maybe 40 miles an
hour, 50 miles an hour, and when the train slow down and maybe in a brushy area where
it would be softer...softer to land, they would try to jump. And to protect us because out
of 50 kids someone had to see that they were jumping out and not to tell the Germans that
would have been the end of every one of us. So we decided with them that they're going
to jump and in about a couple of hours later, we would pretend...we would be
about...and...100 miles away...120 miles away from that area...a couple of hours later, we
would pretend that we just saw the kids jump, and we would tell the German guards that
here two kids have jumped out and here they are. They're laying right here watching us.
And...uh...maybe that would save us and...uh...in the meantime, Seli thit w â€œI; ;D-,
they wouldn't...they wouldn't even look for them that far away and...uh...maybe they
would. So we did itZ; q D that way. We...we took four...four of us, starting talking to the
Germans. They were kind of older and they were not from the SS. They were from the
Wehrmacht, so...so you could speak to them once in awhile. They would...I remember
someone was talking to them about knives, about other/3 61) things. I don't remember the
conversation. About we were watching the homes or the greenery while the train was
going by. We just talked to them and kept them busy. And all of a sudden, like we said,
about two hours later, one kid ran up to us and started to pretend that he's telling me a?
bao secret~ And they got excited and they asked whatts happened. We said, "Go look
quick. Quick. Through that window, the port hole, two kids just jumped out." First, they
didn't believe it and then they kinda looked and then3 AO they said, "Well, it took you
too long. They were right there." And thirdly, they started to call the officer somehow
and made some signs that we should stop the train reco+â„¢blc and to recount them
because if they took them to , we/ # 61D were missing. Now that took a little while. And
they30stopped the train. They took us all out and they counted us three times, and two
were missing. SO they...they asked us,Where did it happened. And they said, "About five
minutes# dD ago, they all jumped out, and we reported it, we saw it."And okay, from
what I understand they did call the localpolice in that town, but that may have had been
10towns...those kids were about 10 towns behind us...andthey...they were looking for
them. What happened? We don'tknow. But from what I heard lately, I think one...ne of/4
40 them did survive. Someone told me a story that one kid whenthey were transported
from...uh...from...uh...we were goingto Buchenwald to Birkenau jumped the train. One of
theLithuanian kids jumped the train, and he's somewhere iny 5 ; > Israel right now. And
I'm trying to see if we can makecontact and meet him. And...uh...that I learned recently
ayear...maybe a few months ago. So we then we came toAuschwitz,- Birkenau. We were
led in. We were kept for3 about 3 days in quarantine, and we didn't know why in
abarrack with straw, not even a shower. Very little food.And we could see a lot of
concerned inmates, old timers whoused to come in and out, in and out, talk to us, and ask
usZ S q t questions. And we found out...out later, the reason westayed there about four
days before letting us into thecamps is because this is the first transport of children

whowere let into Birkenau alive. There were some childrenyC CnD before who came
with their father or families. WhenI say 31 children, 13, 14, 15. And we were the
first...it was late in the war andthings had started to change a little bit. So what happened,
we don't really know.But they told us U aO later that...uh...they were very surprised and
happy that wewere the first ones let in, and we were in quarantine ini â€”a...in a camp
which was called A-lager, A-lager. WciL~ we /6 qO didn't doanything from...just looked
for food. Try see what...uh...we could do.b...That's allwe thought about. There were hot
days and cold days and all kinds of days.J7;6t And I remember after quarantiner they
took us to a children's barrack in the...theD-Lager, which was a working lager, working
camp. They were a lot of kommandos,people who used to go to work every day and come
back. And we had those appells whereyou had to get up early in the morning, stand in
that place being counted day andnight, twice a day to make sure that everyone of US was
there. And at the beginningl didn't do anything there either. There was notn 4 D too much
work for us, I believe. But there was one brigade that used to...that usedto come out of
this barrack. And they were some children whopushed...uh...some...they called q K it a
roll wagon....it looked like a...like abuggy or like a horse and buggy, without a horse and
iVet collected garbage in someplaces in the camps and the crematoriums and things like
that. That was not a bad jObcause when you u6ed to gol t aUDto some of those places
and being a child or young men, you used to meet some womenand older people who
used to give 32d.%you some_share withatheir rations or bread or whatever they v
had. But...uh...that was hard to 4 ve into until one day, 1%;~ O remember it was pouring
rain, mud to your knees, and you hadto go and push that wagon. Well, some of the kids
who wereworking there before kind of hid or didn't show up,/ 4 t6D and...uh...half way
volunteering and half way being picked Igot into that job. And as I said before, many
days thathelped me because people used to hand Fe some things, foodand things like to
eat, which was the most important thing/ 5 ;O in that time. We stayed there not very long,
maybe a fewmonths. The...the crematorium had quiet2 down...quietedD down from what
I understand. They...they didn't exterminatepeople in those days as much as they did in
the earlier daysuntil one day we woke up and we did see all kind of flamesgoing through
those chimneys and we knew that's what's goingon. We knew that they were burning
people over there, butÂ» 5 that day they...someone told us...I don't know how therumors
started. They had rounded up about 3,000gypsies...gypsies and just took them to the
crematorium andjust gassed them and burned them like they did...they didÂ»D Q O the
Jewish people. And that was...uh...kind of scared. _..Needless to say, also...now it's
coming back to me...uh.. Hthose A and D lagers, we were...we were...there were Â»
~ QO selections too. I almost forgot about those.9e day we 4 were on the

instrument, measuring device 7 likea asquare. And we had to walk under it. And
Iremember you never knew whether to be tall is better or tobe short is better or to older or
to be younger. You neveraw R O knew. There was a lot of deception, a lot of lies,
andconfused us completely. And this I think, also, wasa; Q D instrumental in..in some of
us not being as resistant as weshould have been because we were completely lied
to,deceived and mishandled and by the time some of us woke up, .. Q_ it was
almost too late. This measuring device I remember walking through it and I
barely touched that bar-SSacross and my number was not taken that da H Some
of the shorter =* ones I remember was taken. But you really never knew what
S was the right wayX They had you confused completelyg And 34 after that...I
believe after Birkenau, we went...they evacuated us or theytook us out to...uh...what they
called...we went to Auschwitz for one day, and theydid...and then Auschwitz, that was
the big concentration;3 %~ camp near Birkenau. And then they took us to which was
called farm. And that farm wascalled _ Birkenau again. There were different names. They
separated a lot of us, andl wound up in that ofaq~ y Birkenau where I was very sick. Had
pneumonia and stayed in...there was aHungarian-Jewish doctor took care of the little
hospital. He had a few bedsand...uh...he took care of me with some medicines. I
was there for quitea few X weeks I remember and just barely got better or well by
the time they took us to Buchenwald. And that was quite aa 4 q O march. Also
I...another incident happened. I forgot to tAo94(Otalk about that one...in Birkenau
when we got the needles.w _I don't know, 5, 10 of us got the neelles and we were just a
G (tlaying in whatthey call a hospital and the main doctor who took care of us was a
French-Jewishdoctor. He was extremely kind, understanding and tried to help us. Matter
;ao offact, he saved our lives there. I remember before ..evacuation day, we had to be sick
about 21 days in order to be declared notcontagious and...uh...I think that day we __;
were about 17 days in the hospital and we remember himrunning back and forth trying to
doctor all kinds of peoplein charge and what we remember, he signed something or 35
declared us well enough, we were not...we were not contagious anymore. Itwas touch and
go until he was ableX 1D to declare us not contagious and...and they were able to
evacuate us with everyoneelse. In that of Birkenau ....(Pause) we were...we were most of
us were working atW +Â¢r on;6 6 Z S the tincv I don't remember. I didn't work at the time.
When I was there, I was sickand I didn't do too much.aL q O And...uh...if not for that
Hungarian doctor, I wouldn't have survived there either.Because I must have been well
enough to make that long trip to Buchenwald. Wewere...we were(b about 6 days I believe
and 6 nights. We were walking for many, many, many days...formany hours and I think
at night we stopped just for a little sleep a few hours. Andthen I think we were on trains.
They put us on trains right before9D we got to Buchenwald. And it was wintertime and it
was open wagons and you...wegot...uh...one of my eyes was very infected and...uh...I
lived with that throughBuchenwalda N qOmost of the time. Some days it was better,
some days it was worse. But I don't thinkthat I had any treatment for that. Uh...In
Buchenwald we were again in a children'sbarrack, ina S n quarantine for 66. They
brought 66 I believe in the back of the camp. In that barrack,there were a lot of
Hungarians, Slovakians, German, Polish Jewish children and someof us, Lithuanians.
