Q: Will you begin by telling me your name, date of birth, where you were born, and your
name at that time?

A: It is Estelle Klipp right now. But I was born Estella Gippsa Weingarten (ph). And I was
born in Lodz on Savatzka (ph) number 40 -- and in the year 1922, January 10th.

Q: Try to look at me. You're looking down.

A: Okay.

Q: I'll turn the lights off, its a little irritating. Tell me a little bit about your family life before
the war.

A: It was beautiful. It was a vary large family. My parents, sisters, and brothers -- I mean,
my mother had about seven siblings. And my father, the same. And for instance, on
Purim we're gathering all of us in the house of my grandma. And it was.....

01:02:21

Q: Stop tape. We have to do this again. Tell me a little bit about your family life before the
war.

A: Now, as an example, for instance, on Purim we were all gathering at my grandma's

house. It was grandma Weingarten. And it was extremely festive, you know. On Purim,
you bring schlackamonies. So there were just beautiful cakes, and what they call torte,
and there was fruit. And everybody gathered there, all my cousins, and all my aunts and
uncles. And usually, it lasted -- there was one cousin who played the violin. And that
was Itzic (ph) Weingarten. And then we -- it was very nice for us children because we
had to stay up longer. And then when we came to our house, the manager of the house
came out, and we have to ring the bell, and he opened the gate. And for us children, it
was a big happening coming so late. And he -- and it was Purim. But it must have been
cold because he was coming out with a fur coat. And it was a good life. We were to our
grandma's we surely went by druzka, which was a horse -- horse-drawn carriage. And
there was always a lot of fun too. We met the cousins. There were my aunts. And in the
summer, in the beginning, we used to go to a spa, like Rainitza (ph), or Rapka (ph). And
later on, we built a house in Portumbina (ph). And it was one -- there were, like, four
apartments. And one was ours, and the other one we use to rent out. In fact, I have a
picture in front of it. It was beautiful there too. And we were spending the vacations
there. So life was pretty normal and very much based on family. I was going to school.
It was called gymnasium imienia Hochsztajnowei. And it was a lovely school. It was so
beautiful there. In our auditorium, the floor was like a mirror. And when we came to
school, we had to change shoes. And we often had concerts in school. We had the grand
piano. And there was often -- Chopin was often being played. When I hear Chopin now,
Iremember it. And my brother was going also to a school. And in the afternoon, he had
to go to a parochial school to learn more Hebrew and so on. And we used to play. I
remember we played train, I and him, in the house when our housekeeper put the chairs
in the middle so that she could clean them. And there were holidays. There were
beautiful occasions. There were summer outings. There were picnics. And all ofa

sudden, like a lightening from the sky actually, everything changed. And, of course, we
had no idea that anything like that could actually happen. And so there were actually
clouds in the sky. There was bunchen where the people from Germany were coming.
But somehow, when you live a normal life, you just don't think and don't believe of such
a possibility. My father did -- after the Germans entered Lodz, he predicted certain -- I
mean, even before, he predicted certain things. And I asked him, "If that's what you
believe, why aren't we leaving?". First, there was no place to leave. And then you have
really to have guts and you have really -- to be able to leave. But there was no place to
leave. Nobody wanted us.

01:06:31

Q: Let me stop you a minute. Was your family fairly religious? You had mentioned Purim.

A: Yes. We actually celebrated all the holidays. And my father was rather religious. He
was -- at the same time, he spoke French and he spoke German. He was a wizard in
mathematics. And, of course, we had a business. The business was on Ostrowska 10 and
polizei station. And it was Golontaria Emenya Weingartenya (ph). And everybody in
Lodz knew that place. And today, I sometimes meet people here even in Los Angeles
who said, "Of course, we were going there." We had a very good name. Everybody was
safe because in Lodz, at that time, you didn't have prices on any articles. But they knew
you could send a check to that store and they would be treated fairly.

Q: What kind of store was it?

A: If somebody is familiar with the Silk Shop, which used to be in Los Angeles, it was very
similar. There were wools, and lace, and buttons, and gloves, and hats, and -- I mean, all
kinds of things. And it was in existence for a very long time, until the Germans took the
keys away. And so my father's family was more religious than my mother's family. But
we celebrated all the holidays. And our Passover was just fantastic. It was so beautiful
and -- it was so beautiful, I remember that we -- I used fall asleep finally, because it
lasted so long. But all the -- it was just beautiful.

Q: Did you --

A: You asked me about the school, sorry if I interrupt?

01:08:36

Q: Well, yeah. I was wondering if you had any Christian friends or if you really lived in a
Jewish community.

A: It's very interesting. We lived in a Jewish community. The manager of the apartment
house was not Jewish. And in our summer house, the keeper of the grounds was not
Jewish. And some of the housekeepers at my grandma's house were not Jewish. But, in
generally, we were actually -- we thought that everybody was Jewish. Yes.

Q: Large Jewish community?

A: It was a very large Jewish community. Lodz was -- I understand there were 250,000
Jews or more. It was a textile in the street there and it was called the Polish Mattress
Stash. And so when some of this -- of the big industrialists in textile were going to our
school. It was Vininsky (ph), Korn (ph), and others.

01:09:46

Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism or you just weren't around it?

A: Oh, we felt it. Somehow we did feel it. We knew that it exist. We felt it much more
before -- after Hitler came into power and after the death of Marshall Pilsudski. That
really felt it and I remember one program. We went to the summer house all the father, I
and Lolick (ph) and when we came back my mom was petrified, terrified standing at the
window because she had a feeling which I will always remember because she knew there
is a program and -- but we were able to somehow safely reach our house. And there was
some times such a underlying fear of certain things which I as a child could sense and it
had much to do with anti-Semitism. That .... did that answer your question?

01:11:01

Q: Yes.

A: Yes, and it, your question actually right now is how it was before the war? See, that

school I was going to was a private school and I started the school from the first grade
and then I was maybe fortunate because I gained one year to graduate and they -- I had
my papers graduation papers. I thought they were very important. Dave, my husband,
saw them and when we went to Auschwitz I thought it would be helpful. I put it in my
stocking. But of course, it wasn't helpful. I could get a copy, I think, if I would write to
Warsaw, but it's not -- not really important right now. So it was -- it was actually a good
life. It was a Jewish life. We also had very high morals and ethics. And I remember that
when the Germans came and we had to wear the yellow star I was, nothing to it as I was
concerned, but I had a friend, Genya Finkelstein (ph), who was from a little bit more
assimilated home and she didn't want to go out I said, "Genya, they're doing it to us.
They are the perpetrators. Let them be ashamed. Why should we be ashamed to wear the
star?" And it had something to do with the upbringing I received in my house and we
knew much about charity. My father used to always to say "It's not enough to give. It's
important how you give." I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who
needed help. There was always help ready for them and every Friday night my father
was bringing from the House Of Prayers a guest which is called the orrach, and he was
sitting with us at the table and when we finished the meal he was given a bag of food to
take with him and nobody asked him any questions. It was a charitable atmosphere in
our family. For instance, my grandmother one time somebody stole silver spoons and her
daughter says, "Don't let him in anymore." She says, "Look, if he wouldn't have needed
the spoons, he wouldn't have taken them." So considering the high ethics and high
morals it was inconceivable for us to think that such atrocities which followed later on
are possible that we had to prepare ourselves, but there was no way to prepare ourselves
anyhow.

01:14:00

Q: One more question about before the war. Were you involved in any political or Zionist
organizations?

A: I knew of their existence. I knew of their existence. However, in -- in retrospect I know
that it was -- actually the right thing to do. Because if you have an idea, no matter how
impossible it seems at the certain time what should actually follow it? Because the first
there is an idea always and there are deeds following it. But because of the background
and because of the school I was not involved in it. I remember a certain time somebody
wanted to -- to -- me to join, but I didn't.

01:14:55

Q: What do you remember about the day when the Germans came in to Lodz?

A: Yeah, it was a very, very frightening thing. They put up some --

Q: What was the, I'm sorry. What was the date, do you remember?

A: It was in 1939 and it must have been already in September. And some gallows were put
on in Lodz and some Jewish men were hung and they were very much interested that as
many as possible people would see it. When they entered Lodz they somehow wanted to
harass and abuse the Jewish men, so there were, let's say, a knock in our house and they
wanted my father. People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to

actual work. Some people were, for instance, bringing furniture up the set floor and the
others were suppose to take it down and so on. It was just shear harassment. Shear
torment. Shear like they wanted to demoralize us and what was happening was my father
was still going to the store and I was afraid that he'll be picked up and harassed, so I was
going with him and he called me his angel. I had long brown hair and somehow I was
very often able to talk the German out of letting him go. I remember that one time we --
they brought us into a court yard and they left. And -- but it was a very frightening time
because it was a very unsure time because -- and what was so tragic about it the Germans
actually could not recognize who is a Jew and who is not, but there were Polish children
standing on the street and pointing out to the Germans who is Jewish and considering that
they were just having been occupied by the Germans and why did they do it? You know,
very often I'm thinking about it. Where does all this, I mean, it's -- it's based on -- on the
teaching unfortunately of the church which I hope is being changed. But in Poland it will
take a very, very long time until it would be changed. I heard somebody saying that he
got this feeling of a stygmatism with the milk of his mother. Because -- and as I
understand, that the church, the -- anyhow the Catholic Church since Pope the 23rd, is
realizing that the roots, a lot of the roots of this tragedy actually started with the people of
the church. Because it can teach hatred and there have been changes in their liturgy and
their changes are -- are going on. I'm sure there are many, many Christians of very good
heart and I'm glad that there is from the Vatican some directions now to change the
liturgy.

01:18:48

Q: Okay. We were talking about how the Polish people would -- would turn you in. What

else was happening on the streets at this time?

A: It was especially -- for instance, it was so dangerous that my parents decided to send
Lolick, my brother, to a smaller city where his closest friends were living. In the hope
that he would be spared, but he came back after awhile because things were just as bad
there. There was also much more difficult to get fuel. Much more difficult to get food,
so we were living in one room in order to save fuel. We could sometimes -- of course we
couldn't get the amount of food which we needed, but we still could get some food. It
was dangerous to get out of the house. It was dangerous to be in the house because they
were just coming in and pulling you out.

01:19:52

Q: Were there any bombings?

A: The bombings were in the short period before the Germans came in. In fact, we went to a
cellar. We -- you know, there were cellars where people were keeping the food to keep it
cold and we were hiding there because there were some raids. That was in the period, the
short period, before the German army actually entered Lodz.

01:20:24

Q: So how long did -- how long did this last? The Germans were in the -- the Germans
came in, they were around all the time harassing people?

A: Yes, they were harassing people and one day when I brought my father to the store some
Germans approached him and told him they wanted the keys to the store. We just had to
hand it over. Now, we probably were expecting it and were bringing certain materials
from the store and hiding it under the hardwood floors and we hid there also some
Torahs. Maybe I'll mention it later, but when we were in the ghetto the manager, we
assume, or we actually know that the manager of that apartment house informed the
German about it and my brother was taken to the Kripo and from the Kripo he had to go
to our apartment house and to -- to show them where everything is and they removed
everything. And it was -- you know, it was a very -- it was a very dangerous, dangerous
time because there were shootings. There were shootings at that time and this -- this
constant harassment, you don't know whether a person would go out on the street or even
from his house and he would come back alive because the torture was quite perverse.

01:22:10

Q: So, did you stay in most of the time?

A: We must have stayed in, but they were also coming into the house. I remember one time
when they came and we hid my father in the bathroom, but it didn't help. We had to
show them where he is and they pulled him out. And he wasn't -- he was very spiritual
and he was very learned, but he wasn't a strong man, a very strong man physically. But
he actually survived at Auschwitz.

Q: Did the Germans promelgate a bunch of decrees? Were there new laws, things you had
to do?

A: Yes. Yes. Yes.

Q: Like what?

A: First they liquidated all our stores. We couldn't own any stores. I'm sure there was a
catch for us. The amount of food we could get was limited. Of course, I couldn't -- the
schools were closed. Our schools were closed. We had -- we had -- actually, the minute
they came in we were prisoners. We were prisoners and as an example of it they were
putting up gallows and, you know, hanging people. And, our dignity was taken away -- I
mean, it my -- the way I feel it, my dignity was never taken away. Not even in
Auschwitz. I never felt inferior to them. It could be with the teaching of -- the teaching
atmosphere of my house I felt that the ones who do the wrong they should be ashamed of
my -- of themselves and when I heard somebody say that he felt inferior during this time
it struck me actually because I -- I never felt inferior. Never.

01:24:20

Q: Did all these changes happen right away?

A: Right away. Right away, but the taking out of the -- I mean, the -- asking for the keys of
the store because I remember I was still taking my father to the store for a short time and
before he had to hand over the keys.

Q: You must have been fairly terrified.

A: We were fairly terrified. It was, they were a very terrified times. Very terrified time.

01:24:55

Q: Did your family have any plans or you were just going to....

A: There was no way. There was absolutely no way. You live a normal life and something
which is beyond your many imagination happens you cannot prepare for it. There was no
way to prepare there were some very very rich people who were somehow able to -- to
reach a different country. However, even the people of Germany who would have left
Germany couldn't. There was no place to go. Even -- even a ship was -- a ship was sent
aware form the shores of the United States. The white paper was issued and there was no
entrance to Palestine. Otherwise, some people could have maybe reached Palestine. No
other country would have opened the door, so, I mean, we were just boxed in.
Completely boxed in. And, so some people did leave to Russia, for Russia. And a friend
of my -- the closest friend of my brother left for Russia and survived, and he asked, he
came to our house and asked my father's permission that Lolick should go too. And I do
understand my father on -- on -- in a way because he said we all should stay together.
Nobody could have predicted what would happen and he said no. And Lolick was an
extremely -- first he was absolutely gorgeous. He was so handsome that when he was
helping out sometimes in the store people would say "Go to that store just to take a look
at that guy because he's so handsome." Then he was extremely talented. As a child he

was curious how the grandfather's clock is working. So he took it apart and when he
couldn't put it together he used a string, but the clock was working. I mean, by losing
him, of course I lost a brother, but the world lost something too. And when we
considered all these people who were burned, gassed, tortured, murdered, the world lost
something too because they were scientists and they were future doctors and they were
future physicists and they were just people who learned from childhood, charity. And
that you are not living only for yourself, but you're living only for others.

01:28:08

Q: At what point did the ghetto come about?

A: Um --

Q: What did you find -- I mean, how did that happen?

A: Yes. There were announcements that we better go to the ghetto or else they'd be shooting
us.

Q: When was this do you remember?

A: That was in 19 -- 1940. It was maybe six months after the Germans entered Warsaw. I
guess when we went to the ghetto it must have been somehow the beginning of April and
they -- so we just had to go because otherwise, we would have been killed. And
fortunately there was a neighbor of our's who was very helpful because she said she had

some kind of a wagon and why don't we go with her? So we packed some belongings.
Not much of furniture and we went. It was very very traumatic. I was a pretty pampered
child. I wasn't a child anymore, I was 17. But I was pretty pampered and I couldn't take it
so I kept fainting and there was no, there were only lavoratory -- there was no, you know,
accomadations for bathrooms or anything like that. And I remember we stayed there and
then Ciotka [aunt] Hannah (ph) came and Uncle Moshe (ph) came and we all were
sleeping on the floor and then some how somebody told us about the room of the
Fresetska (ph) eight. I think it was the same neighbor and that was one room. We lived
in this room and that was my father, my mother, my brother, myself and later on during
one deportation there was also Ottos. Ottos --

Q: You know, I'm -- What had you decided to take with you?

A: The time was very limited.

Q: When you went to the ghetto?

A: Yes, and the amount of things we could take on this wagon was also very limited and, of
course, we didn't have anybody ecspecially to help us, but anyhow I remember when
the -- I remember that we had a bed. And I remember that we had one piece of furniture
which must have come from our kitchen. We had also a table and we had chairs and the
room wasn't very large and what -- when ever I think about that place on Fresetska eight,
who wasn't -- which wasn't very big and was the kitchen and everything was in this one

room, I have to give an enormous credit to my wonderful mother because it was
extremely clean. Always, extremely clean. We're cooking there and sometimes I think
about it, how was she able to keep this place such meticulously clean. And later on after
one deportation Ottos, our cousin, was adopted by us. I think it had to be done so that
they have his name in the register so, that's why he was really adopted. And he came to
us with a skin disease and my mother bathed him and cured him and my father got
infected and she bathed my father, and she cured him. And my mother was absolutely a
very remarkable women. She was very beautiful. She found a job for herself, by herself.
She was doing some -- some working with a sewing machine. She cooked where ever
there was some food to cook. She keeped everything clean and I know that at a certain
time she was going to sick people and she was washing them. She was washing their
bodies. And thats why the tragedy of -- when ever the tragedy was touching my mother
she never complained, but it was very very painful to me and -- if I think about the time
we were taken to the Kripo. Kripo was the Kriminal Polizei. They were actually having
a building within the ghetto and since we were considered well to do in the ghetto, I
mean, before -- they assumed that we had some valuables which they wanted to have.
Now first it was only my father who was being taken to the Kripo. We were just petrified
of the thoughts that they were going to take him and whether he would come back. Many
people didn't come back from the Kripo. The Jewish authorities were notified to take the
corpse away from Kripo. My father never disclosed anything and the strength his -- his
spiritual and strength to be able to take the -- because they were actually whipping and
hurting him and he came back and he didn't disclose anything. One time, they took my
mother and I remember exactly. I was standing there when they took her and fortunately
they came later on for me because I was very much afraid about her not that that I could
do any help. I remember I walked into the Kripo, the cellars, in the cellars, there were

the torture chair -- there were the cells, where we were kept and in the back were the
torture chambers. So when you were sitting in the cellar you could hear cries and
screams. And -- but when I walked in there and this head of the Kripo, I think his name
was Stutar (ph), was standing there and I laughed. I was laughing in his face and he says
"Das Lachen wird dir hier vergehen," which means "The laughter will stop here. Your
laughter will stop here." And I was also taken to the -- to the chambers and I was also
tortured, but not to a degree that, you know, that I had to be hospitalized or something
like that. And finally, I don't know how it happened that they were -- released us. It --
the whole time we were in the ghetto, there was always an enormous fear that we would
go to the Kripo. And I remember when my father was in Kripo, when I was very
concerned that he is not coming back, and he is not coming back. I went to his brother's
house. The brother was already deported. But his two sons -- one son was there. And
the son was very religious. He was the one who was playing the violin so beautiful. And
he was a real genius. And he says he was very religious. He said to me, "Look. It's
Friday night, and we didn't light the candles yet. So until we light the candles, he might
still come back." I just remember what he was saying. Even in the ghetto, we tried to
remember when it's Friday. And on certain holidays, we made some -- mother prepared
something from the grass, or from the leaves, or something which was appropriate for
that particular holiday. Now, you want to ask me something?

02:06:57

Q: No.

A: No, no. Now, the problems in the ghetto were hunger, lack of fuel. But the worse of the

worse was, the constant, deportations. And you could never be sure that, what is not
being deported. And -- but there was one deportation, in particular, which was done by
the Germans. The other deportations -- when they hit somebody, of course, it was very
tragic. So we really did not know for sure what was happening to us, and nobody thought
that we were going to places that they would gas us in some wagons. In the beginning,
they are telling us, they are taking people to work. And there was a small number of
people who were deported from the ghetto for the purpose of working in Germany, or in
the territories. In fact, one of my cousin, who was pretty husky, came back one time
from a working camp. But they took him -- after a very short time, they took him again.
I don't know whether to a working camp. Very likely, yes. But it was torturous work.
So we did not know. We actually had no inkling that a deportation means being taken to
death, or gassed, or murdered. And this Germans were master of deceit. Before they --
the deportation to Auschwitz, there were loudspeakers. And I don't know who, in
particular, it was. But it was people. And they were assuring us that we should take
everything we possibly can with us, because we are going to a better working camp. And
I remember that my brother was working very hard to pack everything possible. They
say, "Take pots and take pans, because you are going to a better place" -- and I was sick
already at that time. So I was just watching them. But they were packing. Now, the
deportation -- going back to the deportation. There were always deportations. There was
a list made, which in view of what happened -- this was, I think, '42, September -- the
alternative -- the other alternative was very -- was terrible. They just -- I am -- they just
came into the ghetto with trucks and with wagons, they ordered a gehsperren, which
means, you know, a curfew -- they ordered a curfew and they said that they would take
all elderly people, they would take children, and take -- we are -- if anybody would hide
in the apartment, they would be shot. What I did -- I knew -- my mother was actually in

her 40s. But she already had gray hair. And I was very much afraid for her, that they
would take her. I don't know how I did it. But I took her to the part of the ghetto which
they already were searching and taking people away, and I hid her there. But I had to run
back because there had to be a certain amount of people present in the courtyard for them
to do the selection. And then I went back and brought her home. Now, that was a
terrifying time, because they were shooting anybody who, let's say, approached a wagon,
or run to a place that they didn't want to, or whatever. They were all shooting. They
were just shooting. They were taking some people who were younger. They did not
really select only the older, the elderly, ones. It was one of the most traumatic, terrifying
deportation. So there's no excuse for anything. However, maybe because none of my
family was deported -- so I'll tell you in a few minutes about my brother. In comparison
with the alternative, the alternative would have been -- I'm talking about the list -- the
alternative would have been that they would enter the ghetto and just shoot whomever
they wanted and drag whomever, which was of course much more frightening to begin
with. And we didn't know and no one knew that we are going, just like we didn't know
about Auschwitz, which I am very surprised that the Poles or somebody from the outside
would not somehow give us, because they knew. They knew where Auschwitz was, and
they knew what was going on in Auschwitz. Anyhow, one time, my brother was about to
be deported. What happened -- my mother was at her sister's, and I was home, and that
Sonderkommando came, and they looked for him that he was supposed to be deported.
And he hid. But we had to, we had to, he had to come out of the hiding, and they took
him. And I had only one solution. See, he was very sick in the ghetto. He was sick with
typhus. And he was -- that was a very terrible experience, because he was very sick and
his eyes were not completely closed, only partial. And finally, it was so hard on me to
look at it that I was sleeping at a neighbor's and, in the morning, I was going to the

window -- we had the shutters closed -- and looking through the shutters whether he is
still there. And my mother, did everything possible -- we got some food for him -- she
washed him, she bathed him. And a neighbor told us of a doctor who was a heart
specialist, Doctor Yorkiche (ph).

02:13:59

And Doctor Yorkiche found that his myocardium, which is a sac around the heart, is infected.
And everybody suspected its typhus also. But if it would be -- if they would have taken
him to the hospital -- of contagious diseases -- you would have never come out. Nobody
came out of there. And -- but -- so he was finally taken to the hospital, a regular hospital.
And fortunately, this was not at the time. Because later on, the German took all the
patients from all the hospitals, including the children's hospital, and deported them. But
that was earlier. He reported that he was going to work. But I knew Doctor Yorkiche.
And Doctor Yorkiche was supposed to be in the commission to select who is going and
who is not -- no, I mean, -- so I ran to her, and I said, "Do you remember how sick he
was? Do whatever you can do, and she must not have done it because they didn't take
him." So we were together -- and maybe I should inject it now. When you
philosophically think about life, it's true. They didn't survive. I'm the only one who
survived. But everyday -- I mean, the life is not forever anyhow. So that we were
together and that we were together until Auschwitz has its great value. And when we
talk about going to Auschwitz, I will mention to you that we had a day extra. But I think
I should do it later. My father was also sick. But he also recovered. And he had a work,
which was much too much for his physical strength. So -- but I was able to find him
some other work. I felt always some responsibility for everybody. When my brother was

sick, I prayed that if somebody has to go, let it be me, but not him. And I always tried to
get something. I was able to get some soup, I was able to pick up some leaves, I was able
to go to the resort of -- I mean, the place where there were vegetables -- and get the
potato, or get something. But finally, you know, there was a lot of starvation. And I,
actually, was never used to -- wasn't a big eater. But I was the one who had swollen --
who had edema. And later on -- that was already '43. '43 -- I may be jumping around --
but in '43, many people had tuberculosis, many people had pleurisy, the worst diseases,
which were the result of starvation, because there was very little food. It was an
accumulated process. The body was being starved and being starved and being starved.
In the beginning, you saw people in the ghetto who were much slimmer than they used to
be. You could see it in their clothes. You could see, when you look at them, they had
funny color of skin. But later on, there were people working with a lot of edema. It was
from malnutrition. And there were many people dying of tuberculosis. Most of the
pathological diseases somehow disappeared, like my father who used to have diabetes.
He didn't have it. My mother used to have a kidney stone. She didn't have the kidney
stone. It was mostly the effect of malnutrition.

02:18:05

Q: Tell me a little bit about the food situation. How did you get food?

A: There were portioned. And they were -- see, depending what the German appropriated --
for the ghetto population. It was known in the administration of the ghetto. They were
also very good at knowing where people lived, where people worked, how many people
died, how many people -- most of the time, they even knew how many people are

deported. Only the time when the Germans deported people, probably, they were not
able to have the real good statistics. So they were able to fix the rations for -- based on
how much food it was. Now, there were sometimes starvation rations. Now, people who
had worked were entitled to a soup. The soup was actually some vegetables and it wasn't
much. But it was something. And we all were working. So we all had the soup. And
the rations of food were sometimes very, very small. But it was, I was able sometimes to
get an additional soup, or something additional. We somehow -- I mean, I was actually
the smallest eater before the war. I had -- I had signs of starvations already. And so -- I
sometimes think about it. How that everybody -- there was very little food. But it wasn't
like -- you know, sometimes you stand in line, and you say, "No, we ran out of food." It
didn't happen. Everybody -- that's a little minimal, that very little was substandard. I
mean, and it was not sufficient, it was a starvation diet. But everybody got it. And here,
maybe -- maybe we should give thought to the way the administration of the ghetto has
been formed and of their functioning, that they were able to provide everybody with what
little it was. But everybody got it. It was never a situation that somebody was
completely left out. And also, most of the time in the ghetto, maybe not at the very end, I
don't recall any time where there was ever corpses on the street, or where there was -- we
had to -- it had to be clean, because the Germans would not -- would have closed us up
and finished the ghetto off. And also, there were in the beginning, and now later on too,
but people were after -- they were afraid to go the hospital, because they were afraid they
would be deported the way -- it was a big tragedy. Human life, as I see it, was very
important to everybody in the ghetto. Because I recall that we -- there was a little bit of
land at Fresetska eight. And it has been divided so that we can -- not at the very
beginning, but later on -- it was divided so that we could grow some tomatoes, or onions,
or what have you. And I, we had also a piece of land. Now, I don't recall that anybody

stole anybody's vegetables, and really don't recall it. And I am very impressed -- I am
very impressed with it. And as far as the neighbors, where my brother would sleep, they
were very helpful. They disappeared. They must have been deported. The neighbor
who came with us, who helped us with that wagon -- they were deported. And they had a
little child. In '43, you didn't see any children. There were no children in the ghetto. In
the very beginning, the administration in the ghetto tried to have schools. One time, there
was even a graduation. And to keep up, you know, the intellectual part of life so that we
can survive intellectually. Now, about the German Jews who came in, I remember them.
They were so different. They were, like, normal people. Go ahead.

02:23:08

Q: Well, before you tell me about them, when did they come in and how did that happen?

A: Must have been -- wait for just a second. They might have come in in 1941. 1942 was
that big, big deportation. And they were deported before. So it must have been, like,
1941, or something like that. They came from the lawyers, Germans, Germans who have
the iron crosses, I mean, some Mischlings, which means they were married to Jews, some
whose ancestry was discovered that they were Jewish, some who were actually Jewish.
But when they came in, they were normal people. We were not normal people anymore,
not in our -- not in our looks, or not in our way of life. Maybe, some intellectually,
actually were. And they also -- some of them brought farce (ph) with them, or different
clothes. But it was tragic, because it was a very short time they were so miserable. They
were so miserable. But there were also many lawyers. And some of the lawyers were,
had positions later on as prosecutors and judges in the courts. There were courts in the

ghetto, and there were judges in the ghetto, and there was a priest in the ghetto. And so --
and then most of them, the majority of them -- there were some rumors that about 20,000
came in. But many of them, afterwards, were deported. And there were many musicians.
And at the end of the ghetto, all the instruments, musical instruments, had been
requisitioned -- requisitioned. I will just repeat that. And that's it.

02:25:26

Q: When the German transports came into the ghetto, did they mix with the -- with the rest
of you, or did they keep to themselves?

A: It probably varied. For instance, it varied. There was one big industrialist Hirsch (ph).
And I know that my husband let him come to his office where he was and --

Q: Your present husband?

A: My present.

Q: Not your husband in the ghetto?

A: I don't know. That's my first husband. And I was not married --

Q: No, I know that. But when you say, "my husband" you're talking about fifty years ago?

A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. My present husband, right. And he

was -- he was -- it was a Mr. Hirsch. And he -- he was -- he kept exempt so that he could
get us to -- so there was something. Of course, I'm sure they -- when they looked at us,
not properly dressed that there was malnutrition and we probably looked like heck. So of
course, I'm sure they felt superior. So unfortunately, after a not very long time, they
didn't look very much different than we did. But many talented people were -- were
incorporated in the administration of the ghetto. And the, the musicians were -- there
were, sometimes, concerts. So they were active there. And the lawyers were -- were --
some of them were active as judges.

Q: In order to bring in all these new people, did it just get more crowded, or had the ghetto
been cleared of a lot of --

A: At this time, it had been cleared somewhat, but not completely, because there were
people coming from other places, from ghettos which had been closed, like Pabanitzya
(ph), Suskavolya (ph), and others. It was a problem. And that what -- in retrospect or
maybe even then, this very well organized administration of the ghetto, with all its flaws
and so on, was able to -- to somehow incorporate them, maybe first not in apartments.
But they were incorporated, and they were -- given food -- they were also buying food
with their fares and with the fixed wage they brought. But each time there was an influx,
somehow -- somehow, the administration of the ghetto was doing something about
incorporation. But later on, there was so many deportations that the ghetto shrunk. I
mean, you could see when you walked that the ghetto's shrinking. I don't know
whether -- what, maybe, not even one third of the population was there when we were
ready to go to Auschwitz.

Q: Was there -- you've mentioned a number of things like concerts, schools, all this. So
there was --

A: In the very beginning. It was in the very beginning. Because then, when the older kids
and everybody has to work -- and I understand children who were very young had also to
work, so that there was -- the schools were only in the very beginning. Later on, we
could not have any schools. They went to middling schools and if -- if a person wouldn't
work, they could be deported. They had to work. And they took, in this awful
deportation in 1942 -- children were taken away. And before we went to Auschwitz.
There were no children in the ghetto. I heard of a -- of a which, Dave my present
husband witnessed and mother. See, the Germans were masters of deceit. So they were
telling stories, like, they were going to take the children and they should be make to look
pretty, by whichever means is possible, and that they would be going to better places.
And then, this mother had to put the child on a wagon and, right away, she'd become
insane.

03:01:01

Q: You were talking about the ghetto and you had mentioned concerts. Was there some
attempt at a normal life there?

A: A person who has been in the ghetto has to answer that there was no normal. It was
absolutely not a normal life. We were living in a constant fear. And when we talk about
concerts, very, very few people actually attended. We knew that they were -- in the very
beginning, more people could attend. But it really is only like a token that something like
that existed in the ghetto. But I'm sure that many people didn't even know about the
exsistence of the concert, because very few people were able to reveal themselves to
them.

Q: Was there a synagogue?

A: Absolutely not. In fact, there were -- in the beginning, there were some Rabbis. But later
on, they had to -- they cut their beards off, and they were not able to function. In fact,
see, they were -- there was a marriage, marriage ceremony. At the very end, the only
person who can conduct the ceremony was Rumchovsky (ph) -- the Rabbis had no rights
to do anything of this kind. Services -- there was no services. They wouldn't allow that.
See, the ghetto was also changing, it wasn't always the same. If we talk about schools,
they were only at the very, very beginning. Later on, the German wouldn't allow it, they
would allow only work, and they demanded work of children who were very young. I

think anything above 10 -- they had to work. So schools were absolutely out of question.
The life was really, absolutely not normal. So, let's say, our family -- we were extremely
fortunate. One -- one reason for our good fortune was a cellar. In the other room, there
was a cellar. The cellar was very close to the back wall where our bed was standing.
And very frequently, when we knew there was a deportation, we went down to the cellar.
It was very crowded. My brother -- there were two boards to cover that cellar. He
covered it, and he put the bed over it. We would close the shutters. So there were quite a
few times that we escaped deportation this way. That's why we were able to stay so long
before we went to Auschwitz. In the same way -- it was no normals, because it was
terror, it was fear, there were -- I don't -- I didn't have any social life. The life was work,
and you came home, and there was also -- we were not able to use electricity very long.
So it was darkness. And you know, in such a situation as it was in ghetto, you just want
to survive, you are happy that you lived that day, and that your mother lived that day, that
your brother is living the day, that your father is living the day. That was -- that was all
we wanted. And nobody even had -- had -- we, you know -- you have -- you accept it
that you don't live, actually, for today. You accept it that you just -- or you live for today,
that you accept that a day passed by without any deportation, without any shooting,
without any -- any decrees. And it was in the time of the -- it was a time in the ghetto, at
the very end, that they were cutting off parts of the ghetto, so people have to go, have to
leave their apartments and go to others. We were fortunate, quote in quote, that we
stayed, you know, in this, one apartment, from the beginning, you know, to the end. And
when it was very cold -- there were times that it was very cold. But I think that they even
cleaned the streets during the winter, maybe not for us, maybe for the Germans, so that
they -- nothing should happen to the Germans. And it was lie that we -- they were
always some rumors. And it was -- it wasn't really what you call a life. It was a sub --

subliving, subliving. And see, we -- we had something -- that the war is going well for
the Allies. And you know, we were hoping. We were hoping. And that this hope kept
us alive. But we were not even visiting family. First, many of them have already been
deported. And in fact, my grandfather, my mother's father, and his daughter went to
Warsaw. It was a time that, for one reason or another -- I don't know how it was
arranged -- but it wasn't -- it wouldn't have -- it wouldn't matter. Because when I told you
about this Purim celebration, at this very crowded beautiful table, there is, there are only
two people, me and my cousin, Renya (ph), who lives also in Los Angeles, who survived.
All of everybody there, all my -- Ciotka Dopcha (ph), Ciotka Hannah, Ciotka Sulcha
(ph), Ciotka Peza (ph), and their husbands, and their children -- everybody was
murdered. On my mother's side, I had family in Tomachav (ph). And I was able, while
we were still in Lodz, to somehow go there, because I didn't look very typically like a
Jew. And we took some money, brought it to Tomachav in the hope that it would be
easier to live there. So she had two small children. It was Paula Rosenblum and they
perished, they perished. From my mother's side, I had a picture of the Ciotka Rucha (ph),
who perished in Warsaw, Ciotka Paula, who perished in Tomachav. And there was, in
fact, a brother of my mother who lived in Amsterdam. And sure enough, he was taken to
Auschwitz and murdered, with his wife -- and with his two small children. Now, we
were sure that he would be surviving. But he didn't survive even in Holland. They -- so,
you know, when you live in a place where there is death all around you when people are
being deported, when you don't know what will be tomorrow, when everyday they can
come and take you to Kripo and murder you there, when you are starving, when you are
cold, when, when, when there is disease, because there was typhus quite a few times in
the ghetto, you don't really think that there is something like a social life, you don't think
that there is something which would entertain you, or -- we never went to anybody's

house. And the neighbors somehow were disappearing too. They were disappearing.
And so --

03:10:16

Q: Do you remember what you talked about when you were at home with your family?

A: I was thinking about it. I was thinking about whether we talked. But we must have
talked, because my mother was -- one time, had a dream. I do not believe in, you know --
I'm not superstitious at all. But she had a dream that she went someplace, and that she
met her brother, who was in Holland. I mean, he went to Auschwitz and she went to
Auschwitz. I mean -- I mean, why she had this dream and how this dream came upon I
really don't know. And what did we talk about? Now, when --

Q: Maybe we should stop a minute. Is that music still here?

A: So the life was just -- it was to survive, to see that your family survived. And I feel that
considering that we had, you know, this little -- little places where we could grow
vegetables -- and I do not recall anybody stealing. And I remember kindness from the
neighbor and, actually, kindness from the people I worked with. So I don't think that I --
I -- that it is a picture -- a rosy picture is el (sic). (pause) The way I saw it -- and I do not
think that it's something in my imagination -- but anyhow, from my experience -- and I
did not have any special standing in the ghetto, or any special influence -- but I, myself,
experienced a pretty high moral fiber. And the ... that's what I experienced.

03:12:40

Q: Let me ask you; what kind of work did you do in the ghetto?

A: It was actually desk work. There were -- we had to issue what was legitimaceje
obiadove, which means -- there was a little booklet based on it. You got a stamp that you
got the soup. It was actually a part of the administration of the ghetto, which I was
working in. And it was a job like a bookkeeper's job. And we were issuing -- it was
called legitimaceje obiadove, which means -- such a little booklet, where it was stamped
whether -- when somebody got his or her soup. And in order to be entitled to the soup,
they had to have this booklet. So that was my work in the ghetto. Before, I was working
in the produce department doing similar work. And then I was transferred to that
department.

03:14:48

Q: Is this where you met your future husband?

A: Actually, he was the head of the office management in that department. He was very
strict. He was the first to come -- and he was standing there -- and if somebody dared to
come late -- he was just peering at that person, didn't say a word -- I don't think anybody
came late anymore -- and was very much respected for -- for his, I would say, noble --
maybe yes, noble behavior and so on -- integrity -- for his integrity.

Q: Now, working in the food department, I would think, in a situation like the ghetto -- this
is a pretty good job?

A: It did not entitle me to any additional food, maybe sometimes a soup. But otherwise, I
could not get anything. In fact, I had diarrhea, and I needed some rice, and I approached
my future husband, and he refused because he had his reasons. I am not blaming him.
But it is very telling that I approached him, and he said, "No," he can not give it to me.
He had such -- such strong conviction of what he can and what he cannot do -- he
wouldn't give it to me. He wouldn't take it for himself either.

Q: So you had no opportunity to --

A: I had sometimes --

Q: -- cheat a little?

A: I had sometimes an additional soup, which I brought and gave to my parents. But
otherwise, I sometimes -- it was a time that I could -- when there were more potatoes in
the ghetto, I could get a few more potatoes. Then we were actually -- the worst -- we
found out that there was something growing -- I don't know exactly what it was -- it
looked like spinach or something similar -- and we were gathering it, and we were
cooking that. So that was, of course -- every little bit was helpful.

Q: Did people come to you and try to get favors?

A: I was -- I wasn't the one who they knew. So they couldn't come to me for favors, because
I am not -- I don't have the means to give anybody favors.

03:16:29

Q: Were you aware of much corruption and bribery going on in the ghetto?

A: I don't know whether I am an optimist, or I have a rosy outlook. I knew that somebody
who was working, let's say in the bakery, had more, could get some more bread. But --
and somebody who worked in the police department could have some favors. Somebody
who worked in the Sonderkommando and had -- or helped -- was stationed in the
Kriminal Polizei, in the Kripo, for sure was able to get some favors, some more nutrition,
and so on. If you needed medication, you had to go to the people who were connected to
the Polizei, who were either policemen, or something. They were able to
bring some, which I -- when my brother was so very sick, you know, I got some
medication from them.

03:17:44

Q: How?

A: I knew somebody who knows somebody. And so, one time, I got some medication. And
that was in the very beginning. In the very beginning, we had -- it was easier to get
medication. At the end, it was nearly impossible. And maybe, I felt that it is a matter of

fact that people who were associated with these places would have a little bit more
nutrition. But nobody lived in a beautiful apartment. I don't think anybody -- maybe
very few -- had a bathroom. They were mostly latrines.

03:18:37

Q: There weren't -- you went outside?

A: Yes, we went outside. Most of the people were living in one room. See, it was a part of
town which was a part of town where very poor people used to live. So you know, there
were not -- I, you know -- so corruption. By the nature -- let's say there was a
Sonderkommando, who was very much in touch with the Germans -- I mean, not in touch
because they were informers or something -- they were because they were supposed to be
performing certain duties. It was obvious that they had probably a little bit more food.
But all -- as I understood it, all was about food. They couldn't have much better living
conditions, because they were not available -- maybe some people did have running
water and some people did not have running water. Many people did not have running
water.

Q: Now, you worked in the food administration. Was this....

Q: You worked on these coupon books for --

A: Yes.

Q: -- for people --

A: Yes.

Q: -- but your department also worked on distribution to food sitters?

A No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Q: No?

A: We had -- we never saw food. We never saw food. It was just a bookkeeping department.
I never -- no food went through -- we were a part of the so-called Aprovisation
Department. But we were the part, an administrating part, only of this -- of this coupons,
coupon books, and we never saw food. It never came to my office.

Q: Did everybody get coupons? Did everybody get the same amount?

A: Everybody who was working was getting a soup.

Q: And people who were not working how did they get that?

A: There was -- see, what was happening -- there was a certain amount of food which we're
getting besides the soup. And the food, which they were getting besides the soup, they
were getting. And if they were working, they were also getting the soup.

03:21:10

Q: How did they get this, were there soup kitchens? I mean, how did the poor people --
people who were not working, how did they get food?

A: In the Distribution Centers. They were -- everybody was entitled to a certain amount of
food.

Q: They didn't -- they had coupons?

A: It was called -- wait a minute. They were called -- they were cards. They were cards for
food. In fact, as I recall one instance after this deportation from -- when the Germans
were -- came to the ghetto and took the people out -- some people who were not
expecting to -- expected to be taken -- because they just were not so exact to what they
were saying they were going to do -- some people took some of the bread, or whatever,
cards with them, and it was a hardship for the others.

Q: Let me ask you a different question; do you think that women were treated differently in
the ghetto?

A: No, no. It happened what -- it happens even now. The women were living longer. I
think that, physiologically, the women are equipped with -- because we are the
child-bearing species -- that we have certain -- this -- what is chemistry, or there is the
glands, or something -- that we can survive easier than the men, because there were more
women afterwards in the ghettos than there were men. But treatment -- I don't think that
we were treated differently. In fact, you know, in Europe, women were treated better, in
away. I mean, it depends from what point of view you are looking of course, because
the man was the man of the house and the woman, you know, hair drop -- it was
different. So there were many women who were in professions. There were women
doctors. There were women chemists. I had a relative who was a chemist, a relative who
was -- had a kindergarten. And there were many doctors. And actually, I wanted to
study biochemistry. That was my chosen profession which, of course, never happened.

Q: More than -- did you think that there were women who were able to use their appeal, to
get favors in the ghetto?

A: Not that I was aware of -- not that I was aware of. If somebody, of course, worked close
to the administration, there is a likelihood. For instance, I know, when people got
married, they could have asked Rumchovsky to give them -- to give them something.
But I don't think so. I do not think so. I might have not come across it. But I don't think
so.

Q: So how long were you in the ghetto?

A: Until the very, very end, until nearly the last day, because I -- I don't have a tattoo.
Because when we came, the last transports -- they were so crowded that they didn't tattoo
us. So it must have been very late in August already when we came. And we had
extra -- an extra day for ourselves. What happened was that we were on the way which
we didn't know is Auschwitz. And we --

03:25:12

Q: Well, how did -- but how did you even get rounded up; how did all of this happen?

A: Okay. They were coming -- in the beginning, they thought we would go full of tyranny
[terror]. But people didn't go full of tyranny [terror]. So the Germans started rounding
people up. They also came to our apartment. But we had the cellar, and we closed the
shutters, and we went down there, we heard them. They were banging with their rifles in
many places. But it was that we could pull the bed there -- and it was not usually -- I
don't know whether they expected it -- but they banged it on the floor -- they did -- but
they didn't bang where we were. So we did it -- we did it whenever, which was probably
very, very often -- you know, it was -- we were in the cellar. And in fact, what
happened -- I have the picture of my cousin -- and his whole family was deported, and he
came to us. And unfortunately, I, my father, my brother, and Aros (ph) -- Aros must have
been, maybe, seven years, or something like it -- and we don't have room for Fishek
(ph) -- so -- but there was a shed. So we said, "Fishek, we'll hide you there," and we hid
Fishek there. We got up in the morning, we looked in the shed, he was gone. So the

German took him out from there. They were looking everywhere. They were looking
everywhere. They were just -- just going through everywhere and herding people to go,
herding people to go.

03:27:02

Q: And this is in August, 1944?

A: That was in August, 1944. And I -- this was -- like, I wish maybe -- I was thinking about
hiding there. But we didn't have any food, and we didn't know what will happen. If we
would have known where we were going, we would have probably stayed in that ca....,
cellar, maybe suffocated. But we would stay there. Now, with the transport --

03:27:27

Q: What happened, how did you get there?

A: Yes. So this extra day -- I have to tell you about it. So we were on the way to this
gathering place -- and August was just a beautiful month -- and we saw very close where
we were supposed to be gathered. We saw, like, a little house or something. Anyhow,
there was a guard, a German guard, in front of it. But it wasn't a Gestapo. So we said,
"Can we stay there for a day?". He said, "Okay. But no more." So we took -- we took
residence for a day in that room. And I was so spoiled that, even in the ghetto, I had to
have my spoon. And we were there, and -- you know, in retrospect, you sometimes think
only, "Did we survive? We didn't survive, right? We didn't survive. So what good was

everything?". But no. Maybe it's philosophical. And since life is not forever, this one
day was also important, because this was the last day that we were a family and that we
were together. Aros was with us too. And that's why I think sometimes about this day.
And I don't want to say, "What good was it that they didn't survive?". But they had to
stay. And then we went. It was the most strange thing. I met my cousin and her mother
on the ground where we were waiting to be taken away to Auschwitz. And we stayed
together, I and my cousin, until we were liberated, which was very lucky for both of us.
She claims that my spirit helped her to survive, because I was just -- when we were
working in Sasel, one time, we passed by windows which were lit, and there was some
kind of a holiday, and she mentions to me, "Look, we will never live like that." I said,
"What do you mean, Renya? Why not? Of course, we'll live like that." And she always
repeats it. And I think that it was the defiance, the defiance. I just wanted to defy the
Germans, because I went to Auschwitz with pleurisy, which is water of the lungs. I hada
bladder infection. I was very sick before we went to Auschwitz. And when I was lying
down naked on the ground in Auschwitz --

A: Yes.

04:01:10

Q: -- I want you to tell me a little bit about how things were organized in the ghetto.

A: Okay. Since I wasn't -- I was in a very, very small -- my job was administrative. But I
had nothing to do with food, I had nothing to do with distribution of food, or anything of
this kind. So I wasn't so close to the administration. But as a person who lived in the
ghetto from the very beginning to the very end, my assessment is that so it was hunger, so
there was deportation, so there were tragedies -- but there was -- somehow, we knew
what is happening. There were hospitals. Nobody came back from a hospital with
contagious diseases. That's another story. But there were hospitals. There were
hospitals also where children could go. There were hospitals where people -- if some --
if there was a birth that they could go. There was certain civil safety. I mean, we were
not afraid that somebody would come into our house and rob us. There were very -- of
course, some of the criminals were included in the early deportations. That's true. There
were prisons. There was a court. There were judges. There was a prosecutor. They had
names of everybody. They knew where everybody was living. There was a Department
of Statistics. There was a Department of Distribution of Food. And within this
department was the Department of Produce. It was a department where they distributed
flowers. There was a Department of Bakeries. Now, there was milk and coffee. I mean,
they knew exactly about how many people we had. I think that could have changed after
one of the deportations. But they knew. They knew about who has an apartment, or

whether there is an empty apartment. They knew who had died. So it was in this tragic
conditions there was something that -- we, for instance, knew that there would be a
deportation. We, for instance -- besides, there were many rumors which, sometimes,
were not true. Very often, Rumchovsky had speeches and prepared us for certain things,
certain changes, or what have you. They were an instrument -- in the beginning, Rabbis
were performing ceremonies, if somebody, you know, got married. There were
circumcisions performed. Later on, when they -- when the Germans didn't allow it,
Rumchovsky was the one who married people. So for a very short time, there was even
something, like -- on the marichian (ph) was something like a reserve for people who
worked very hard. And one time, my brother had the privilege, and I took him there.
And that was in the beginning. The ghetto became more and more less run by the Jewish
administration, and the Germans had more of a part. But this was at the time when Jews
had more to say about administration.

04:05:05

Q: Was this -- do you think that this was positive that Rumchovsky and the Jewish Consul
had so much control over your lives?

A: Considering the alternative, because if they would not be an order, if there wouldn't be
order, if there would be dead people lying all over, if there would be a lot of crime, I
believe the German wouldn't go for it, they would just close the ghetto.

A: I -- besides that I saw him, I never met the man. But I'm, what I'm thinking -- in this
abnormal condition, with enormous pressure of the German from the outside, with the
population probably being very often not very happy with whats going on, to have this
kind of an administration -- so that since we're taken care of, no matter -- no matter what,
I think that people who survive the ghetto, if not for this kind of an administration, would
not survive it until August the 25, 1944, because the ghetto would have been closed. And
if this workshops, would not be administered, administrated the way they are, they were
they were, the ghetto would have been closed also much sooner.

04:06:50

Q: What workshops are you talking about?

A: The workshops for the Germans, the workshops -- like, there was a leather workshop, and
there was -- there were all kinds of workshops which -- for which, you know, they were
paid, and they could use the money to buy the food, and so on and so on, and -- I mean,
the administration -- the administration, not individuals -- everything, the administration.
Now, you know, when you think today what's going on in certain countries, that, under
this awful circumstances, they had an administration who had everything in check, they
had powers -- of course, they had -- if they wouldn't have the powers, there would be
wars there. Because if somebody wouldn't get enough food or something, no matter
whose fault, people would rebel. But there were no rebellions. Anyhow --

my heart. And aI said, she never complained. And it was so embarrassing. It was -- I
mean -- and there was a little window in that cattle wagon, and people were trying to look
whether we are going. And, as I said before, the day was absolutely gorgeous, absolutely
gorgeous. And here, she was, poor -- my poor mother was sitting on the floor and -- I'm
not sure -- it must have been the air there -- and I don't know what happened to the
excrements -- I think there was some kind of an opening or something. Anyhow, then

they slid the door open from the wagon, and we came out.

Q: How long had you been riding?

A: I do not recall exactly. I was just from Lodz to Auschwitz. From far away, it looked like
a place for the insane, because there was some wire around it and there were people
running back and forth, back and forth, with shaven heads. And here, we had to come
out, leave everything in the wagon. And then they told us to go to the left, to go to the
right. And there was one Oberscharffuhrer at the head, closer to the camp. And he said
to my mother to go to the left, and I went to the right. And not knowing, really, the depth
of that tragedy, I still felt that it means that I'll go to work and she won't. So I run up to
the Oberscharffuhrer, and I said, " Meine Mutter kann arbeiten viel besser wie ich,"
which was true, that she can work much better than I can. So he said," Du willst, sie
schon sehen im abend, " that I would see her in the evening. There were very deceitful,
very -- I mean, that this deceit was the smallest deceit -- I mean, because the one which
they did to get us out of the ghetto was a much greater deceit. Now, I was with my
cousin and her mother, Tess (ph). She had lighter hair. My mother was already, partially
gray. And we went in, and there was a second selection. We were supposed to
completely disrobe, which we did of course -- we didn't have any other choice -- and that
we will go to the showers and -- there was something round -- and I was close to my
cousin and her mother -- and all of a sudden, they took her mother out. It was a second
selection. Of course, when she was undressed, they realized she is not in her 20s or 30s.
In fact, only one mother went with us, a Mrs. Kohn (ph). And what she went through in
the camps -- she was lashed and whipped so many times. But that's another story. Then
we, from there, there was -- they shaved our hair -- and I had long brown hair -- and my

cousin, Renya, said, "You know, I couldn't recognize you" -- so I was calling, " Tusa,
tusa " -- and so I came out and she saw me -- and they shaved our heads -- and we were
naked -- and we were supposed to lie down someplace on the ground to sleep overnight,
which we did. Everything seemed completely insane. And miraculously, I awoke, I
didn't have my bladder infection. Then we were given some shoes, and I was given some
shoes which had my foot, and we were given some clothes. And then I remember
Auschwitz, I remember we were standing, one time, in line and I had some container
with some -- what was supposed to be soup -- and it was all, like, in a maze, what was
happening, what has happened, I mean. And what I see someplace, a sign, " Arbeit
Macht Frei." That was the sign in Auschwitz. And fortunately, we were there only a few
days. And everything seems like a very, very bad dream. And they were telling us that
going out of Auschwitz to a working camp is a rather fortunate occurrence.

Q: Who was telling you that?

A: It must have been some other person -- people who were already -- have been there in
Auschwitz longer. Some of them were incarcerated people.

A: Who were there before.

Q: What else did you observe while you were there in those few days?

A: The first impression was that it was some gathering of insane people. They just didn't
look normal. They absolutely didn't look normal. Their movement didn't -- wasn't
normal. That was my first impression when I went out of the wagon, and I looked to my
left, to my left and -- because we went out of the wagon, and then we were standing
facing this Oberscharffuhrer here. So then I was on the left side -- I mean, I was on the --
my mother was on the left, and I was on the right. So -- and then, as I said, it was like
a -- like a bad, bad dream, the whole thing -- it was so unbelievable, the movement of the
people, everything there. When I think about Auschwitz, I just remember, like,
fragments because it was such an enormous shock. It was an enormous shock for, for
me. And they took my mother away, and my father, and my -- and Aros and Lolick were
also taken away. I didn't know where they will be going. And I didn't realize what
actually happened to my mother for a long time. Because, from there, we went to another
camp. My leg started swelling up. And we went to a camp in Hamburg. There, we were
supposed to be laying railroad tracks. And there were German woman, women who were
our -- I don't know -- they were called Kapo. And in the morning, very early in the
morning, we have to stand in line. And there was a German SS, and he was pointing out
who's going and who's staying. In the beginning, I went. And in this camp, there was a
doctor. In most camps, there was a doctor. They wanted to have us, on one hand,
probably, fit, and on the other hand if not, eliminated. So this -- this doctor -- I ask her
whether I still have water on the lung. And she said, "Yes, you have." And I had a cut

on my leg. So she put a very large bandage on my leg. And it so happened that, after I
had the bandage, in the morning, she, for a short time, pointed out for me to stay. Now,
you were asking whether I realized what happened. So what actually -- when I started
going to work, it was very hard. It was very hard, to me, to climb on the wagon because
my legs were so swollen. But since it was very early, there were stars in the heaven, and
I prayed. So I prayed for my parents, and for Lolick, and for myself. But -- so at this
time, I had no inkling what, actually, is happening to them, absolutely no inkling. And
then we were in Hamburg for quite a while.

Q: What was the name of this camp?

A: I remember only that it was Hamburg. I do not know any name of this particular one.

Q: This was not Sasel?

A: No, this wasn't Sasel. From this camp --

Q: How long were you there for?

A: It wasn't a very long time. But it was more than a month. From there, we were
transported to Sasel. And I, as much as it was, the conditions were not good -- this camp
was situated in a very woody area. And I am very sensitive to good air. And also, when
we came there, there were always accommodations that the doctor -- there was a doctor.

So when people came from work, they could come there. It was called the ambulance.
Actually, it's like an infirmary. And I approached this doctor and I asked her whether I
could work for her. And she says -- so she had chosen me to work for her. That also
allowed me to recuperate somewhat. I had to work, I had to wash the floors, which no
big deal. It was a big deal for me then because, you know. But anyhow -- and when
people were coming, I was greeting them, I was taking reports, and I got -- they were
saying that I am very polite and friendly to everybody and -- now, this doctor wanted me
to sleep with her -- she was afraid to sleep by herself -- which I did.

04:20:40

Q: Was she a Jewish woman?

A: Yes. She was from Czechoslovakia. She committed suicide after the war. And so that
was going on for a while. But then, for one reason or another, I guess she wanted me to
sleep with her and somebody else wanted me to sleep in the barracks. But anyhow,
somebody else got my position. So I was going to work. When we were coming from
work, we had to stay at attention. And if there were any complaints about anybody
during the work of any kind, the person was whipped, and we had all to stand and watch
it. And in the middle of this courtyard was something -- I don't remember -- some
wooden contraption or something where the people were whipped. Now, one time, I was
also punished. And it was -- they claimed -- which I do not know whether it's true or
not -- but that I brought some meat. We were working someplace. Over there, we were
digging foundations. And at one time, we were carrying heavy stones, one giving it to
another in a line. And one time, we were called to a slaughter house. And they -- he

claimed that I took some meat into the camp. And I had a big speech. I spoke German.
And I was just sentenced to clean the latrines, which -- I don't know whether -- I think I
remember it right. I never felt -- I felt always defiant. I never felt -- even when I had to
clean the latrines, I didn't feel inferior. This mother, Mrs.Kohn, has been unfortunatly,
she has been lashed and whipped so many times. So over there, one time, I was milking
acow. We were working someplace and we saw cows there. So I was milking a cow.
But unfortunately, another girl was doing something similar -- I don't know whether it
was a cow or it was a bull -- and hit her. And it was tragic. There was not enough food
and the coats -- the coat was a big problem. And one time, we walked -- worked --
walked to work, and we had wooden shoes. And the ice was building up on the shoes
and building up on the shoes, and we stopped and wanted to get the ice off our wooden
shoes. They wouldn't let us. And it seemed like it will never end. And I remember that,
later on, we used to say, "If this walk ended, anything difficult will end." And --

Q: I am going to have to stop you because you are alluding to a lot of things --

A: Yes.

Q: -- was it women and men?

A: All the camps which I was in Hamburg, in Sasel, only women.

Q: Was it large? Were there a lot of women?

A: No. Sasel was not very huge. I couldn't tell you the numbers. But it wasn't huge. I
mean, it was -- in comparison with Auschwitz, it was really small.

Q: How many people were in your barracks?

A: That is a very difficult question for me to answer. We were sleeping in the beds, like,
one, I on the top, and Renya on the bottom, or vice versa, I believe. And how many
people in the barracks? Wait a minute.

Q: 20, 50?

she wanted --

A: Just companionship, just plain companionship. She was scared too. She was, you know.

She was working as a doctor. But she was, you know. She was a prisoner. No, no. She
wanted just -- because she was, scared. She probably lost her family and she was scared.

Q: You don't remember, maybe, people sleeping together --

A: No!

Q: -- having sex --

A: No!

Q: -- or relationships?

A: No, no, no, no! I tell you it's impossible. There was no drive for that. There was -- I
mean, we were so devoid of energy, of desires. I mean, it was all -- what was important
was not to be so awfully cold -- the cold was very hurtful -- maybe not to be so very
hungry, not to be whipped or hurt -- but nothing of this kind. She was just a nice human
being and she was just scared. And at night, I'll tell you, my cousin was also scared, you
know. I mean, people were scared.

Q: Where were most of the prisoners there from? Were most of them from Poland?

A: Yes, yes, I think so. I think so. There was one girl who, who was whom, -- maybe who
was there from Germany -- but probably, she was in the ghetto. And that's how she got
to the camp.

Q: And the guards, or the Kapos; where were they from?

A: There were Germans.

Q: They were all German?

A: Yes.

04:26:50

Q: Did -- well, getting back to strictly women-oriented issues, did you have your period
throughout?

A: Fortunately, not. They said that they gave us something in Auschwitz, or something. But
we didn't have it. We thought that we'd never regain it. But we did regain it because we
have children. But, no, we didn't have it. And we were told that they were giving us
something so that we shouldn't have the period.

Q: That must have been somewhat alarming?

A: Not really, because who would like to be bothered with that.

04:27:33

Q: Did you have enough food there?

A: No, no, no.

Q: Was it any -- was it better or worse than the ghetto?

A: The ghetto fluctuated, you know? Sometimes, it was more. Sometimes, it was less. And
at the end, there was only starvation. We didn't have enough food. For instance, when I
saw the cow, I milked her, you know. And when we went to the slaughterhouse, maybe
I, you know -- I took some meat. We were getting some bread. We were getting some
soup. That's what I -- what I recall. And I recall that the hunger was bad. But the cold
was miserable.

Q: What were they for?

A: We didn't see the finished products. But there were some German civilians also who
were overseers. So there must have been something contracted by the SS, for some
companies, I assume. Because there were some civilian overseers at that place.

Q: Do you think they worked for the factory or housing, or you just don't know?

A: I really don't know. But I don't think about the size of it. It's likely that it was not for
factories.

Q: Were you aware -- well, when you were outside of the camp working --

A: Yes.

Q: -- did you have any contact with the German people?

A: We never have contact. But in Hamburg, one time, they were -- they were looking at us.

But we looked like criminals, because we had this shaven hair, shaven heads, and we had
these outfits, you know, special outfits, and we looked like prisoners.

Tape #3

05:00:47

Q: At this time -- I guess it was the Fall of 1944 -- were you aware of Allied bombings in the
area, or anything like that?

A: Well, we were in Hamburg. Yes, yes. And we were not that happy about it. We didn't
care what would happen to us. And they were running to the shelters. And we really --
we really -- in Hamburg, any time we heard the raid, we were just very happy, because it
was a sign, you know, that something is being done about the Germans, of course, and
that the countries would be saved, from this tyrant. So we were happy about it.

Q: It gave you hope?

A: Maybe, maybe, yes.

Q: You just said something -- that there was a real turning point, in your mental outlook
from Auschwitz --

A: Definitely, definitely. When you have your family, you first, you feel more like a human
being. See, Auschwitz was very dehumanizing. You were not a person. You just were
not a person. And you felt it, that you are not a person. And since Auschwitz, they did
something to us. So as I said, on one hand, I didn't feel inferior -- but I had it also say
that -- you see, there was a lot of where I was -- I knew that I could do something in the

ghetto. So when my brother was sick, I tried to bring him ice because ice was -- had to
be put on his heart. And I remember the person I was getting the ice from. He,
afterwards, saw me. He was afraid to ask me what happened to my brother, because I
was so crushed. I could help a little bit. I could do something. I was still -- I was still a
person who had certain, certain -- I wouldn't say powers -- but I could help my father, I
could help my brother, I could encourage them, I could do something for them, I could be
with them. Now, when they took everybody away and -- I mean, we were not really -- in
a way, we were not really human beings. In a way, you know, you didn't -- certain
feelings were taken away, you know? And besides that, the type of, of, -- I couldn't call
it life -- that wasn't life -- that wasn't life -- and we, but we probably -- I in particular,
probably believed that we will survive. I also believed that my brother will survive. I
also believed that Aros will survive. And, but Bergen-Belsen --

Q: All right. You have to tell me how you got to Bergen-Belsen.

A: All right. Now --

Q: How long were you in Sasel?

A: Very close to the end of the war, because I wasn't in Bergen-Belsen too long.

Q: How did you -- how did you leave Sasel; what happened?

A: They took us on trains. They were not cattle trains. And we were still standing in the
station, and I decided that 1 am going to jump out of the window, which I did. And I
asked my cousin, "Come with me," because I knew there is some camp of some
prisoners, Italians, and I think that maybe I can walk over there, or do something. This
German girls overseers came up to me, picked me up, put me back on the train, and I was
expecting, the whole time, that I'll be punished or something. Nothing happened. Now,
we came to another hell, because Bergen-Belsen was like a dug up cemetery. There were
piles, piles, over piles, of skeletons, one skeleton over the other skeleton, piles, a hill.
We were put into something that looked like a warehouse, lying on the floor. One time a
day -- or I don't know whether every day -- they opened the doors, they whirled up
something which was some watery soup. Now, people were very sick there. There was a
lot of diphtheria. And I remember the latrines. And somehow, I probably had the urge to
survive. So I don't know where I got -- I got some metal containers, one for me and one
for Renya. And when I heard the squeak of the opening door, I ran to the door, and I put
this container into this kettle. So I got some soup -- and I think I got for both of us --
because they were not staying there very long, so not everybody got anything, you know?
So it was important to run there and to get the little bit of watery soup in the beginning.
Otherwise, you didn't get anything. And there, you realized subconciously and
conciously, that I will never see my mother, never see my dad. And just -- just lying --
we were just lying on this floor there day and night. Probably, when we had to go to the
latrine, we went out. We must have gone out, because we were able to see this -- this
piles, piles, and piles, of skeletons, just skeletons, unburied. And they were throwing
more and more piling up more. And, that was Bergen-Belsen.

And I remember when we were liberated, we were liberated by the British. There was no joy in
my heart. I understand they told us -- somebody told us not to run out too early, one girl
did, and she got shot. There was no joy what I was doing, I got some place, some paper
and a pen, and I was writing. I write -- and I never thought that I should keep this
writing. I'm sure I wrote in Polish. And I wrote and wrote. And, then -- that was
liberation. Fortunately -- unfortunately, they meant very well. Some people were taken
to, like, a hospital or something. They meant well. But they wanted to share with us the
food, and they gave some chocolate and other things to people, who were starving for a
long, long time. And their stomachs couldn't take it. So they got diarrhea, and some of
them didn't make it. And then we must have been taken out of there. And we were still
in Bergen-Belsen. But, of course, in completely different quarters, and with food and so
on, supplied by the British.

Q: Do you remember when this was?

A: Right now, I couldn't even think. It was 1945. And I think it was April, 1945. I just
couldn't think of dates.

Q: So you were -- maybe only there a few weeks, or --

A: I think I was there only a few weeks. I think I was there only a few weeks. That's what I
think.

Q: When the British came in, were you inside this barn?

A: Yes, yes.

Q: Then how did you know you were liberated?

A: Probably, the screams, and they probably walked in, and we probably saw the uniforms.
But I know as much as later on, at that point, there was no happiness. Because after
Bergen-Belsen, I -- I knew, that my parents didn't survive. And there was absolutely you
know, maybe, seeing all these corpses, and I mean, you couldn't be happy about anything.

I wasn't happy. However, once we were transferred to some human quarters, and I
wanted to look for my brother. He was in Buchenwald. But he didn't survive. And I do
not know why. And I was sure that Aros would survive, because he was such a tough
young, young boy. I don't know what happened to him. I have no idea. There's no way
to find out anything right. I talked to people who knew my brother in Buchenwald. And
that's why I didn't stay long in Bergen-Belsen -- I mean, not -- this camp in prison -- but
liberated Bergen-Belsen. But I went to Hamburg. I got some clothes there. I don't know
how I did it. And then I went to Hanover, because it was where I was asking
everybody -- I was inquiring whether anybody saw Lolick, and whether they know, and
maybe he registered someplace or something. But, he did not survive. He did not
survive. And so everybody, everybody from this enormous family was tortured, starved,
gassed. And there is a story.

A: Yes.

Q: What did you do?

A: It so happens that I met my present husband, Dave Klipp. And he was already -- at that
time, he was thinking positively. There were people who didn't have a -- who did not
belong anyplace. So he and some others contacted -- not the Nazis, of course, at that
time -- but the German authorities to form this KZ Ausschuss, so that we get some
housing, get some nutrition. Because there were cards at that time. There were
nutritional cards. So I -- at that time, I actually stay stayed in Hanover, and I just didn't
feel like going to Poland, which I very much regret. And so from there, we started living
what I would say is a much more normal life. I was together with Renya and there were
some other people who survived. And so there was already a social exchange. We
already cared that, how we get dressed, and how we look, and we got -- we got through
this KZ Ausschuss.

05:14:14

We got an apartment with some German person. I mean, it was her apartment. And her husband
didn't come yet from the war. So we were -- we were designated this quarters for us to
live in.

A: She was there also.

Q: Wasn't that strange, living with a German after the war?

A: She knew that she just has to let us live there, you know. She realized, you know. It
wasn't really -- it was -- you see, there were not enough housing to give us -- later on, we
did get a house for ourself. But at this time, it was the best solution. Because, at least,
we lived in a normal apartment with a kitchen, and with a bathroom, and so on. At that
time, she realizes they are the, that that's the only way it will be for a while. When, her
husband came from the, back. He was rebeling. He was rebeling a lot. And then, of
course, we got another place to live.

05:16:14

Q: So this organization there gave you food coupons and --

A: Yes. Because the Germans were also getting coupons. At that time, it was rationed.
And we got an apartment, and we got -- we got food -- and we got some clothing, and we
started what you would call the beginning of a normal life. Some people, you know --
that -- that's what was happening.

Q: Was it difficult to resurrect yourself in a way?

know whether it started there or much later -- but I was so elated that I am alive. I just --
my cousin, Renya, was just, like, envious. I mean, she was happy about that. But she
was envious that -- I mean, I felt that Iam alive. And it was -- it was a elation for me
to -- it -- I went through this grieving period for a while. And I was -- we were always
grieving, we were always talking about it, and so on. But this -- this absolute
transformation for being not even a human being -- and all of a sudden, being free --

as possible. There were too many memories and you never knew to whom you're talking.

like that -- then you know: "Watch out." Then we didn't want to -- but anyhow, Dave
had a sister in the United States, in New York. So actually, they were doing something to
send us status. However, I had no pleurisy in the ghetto and also in the camps. And so I
didn't have the pleurisy when I was liberated just miraculously. On an x-rays, there were
shadows. And the United States, very rightfully, didn't want to let people in with
tuberculosis. They would have let somebody in with pleurisy, because it's not
contagious. So I had a very hard time, to, until they declared me. It took a long time
because -- we came here in 1950, liberated in 1945 -- until I got a clearing that I can go.
And that's why it took so long for us to come here to the United States.

house we lived, who we met afterwards -- she just couldn't believe it, that we got
married. You see, there is a big age difference between David and me. But it really --

Q: You know, one thing that's confusing to me -- I've never heard this before about both you
and your husband -- is -- I didn't realize, that you were sort of operating with German
authorities, as opposed to with British -- the British military Government or the American
military Government.

A: All right. Now, we got the British Government -- and that was a UNRR, UNRR -- they
were also helping. Now, I don't know whether KZ Ausschussz was later. Formed later. I
would have to check with Dave exactly where it was -- where it was formed. Because in
the very beginning -- I have a picture with La Guardia. And yes, in the very beginning.
This happened later. That's what -- what we are telling you about the KZ Ausschuss. It
didn't happen immediately after the end of the war. It didn't happen immediately.
Because at this time, we were being sent supplies from the United States to the UNRR,
and La Guardia came, and, since I was involved in with the distribution center of the
food -- but this was food given directly to people -- and La Guardia came -- and there's a
picture of him with me -- he was so shocked when we were telling him what was actually
happening. So in the very beginning, there were not so -- the people started coming, you
know -- more and more people started coming. And then when -- that's how, that's how I
remember it -- because in the beginning, we weren't old. That was -- the beginning, we
were on Auerstrasse (ph), and food was coming, yes, to the UNRR.

Q: And you got involved in food distribution?

A: Yes. I was working together with others and we were -- yes.

Q: When you were in these camps and you were with your cousin, do you remember what
you talked about?

A: We wanted to keep our sanity. So when we were digging this foundations in Sasel, we
were doing some algebraic in the sand. We were doing square roots, when we had a little
bit of time. And um.... See, we were going to the same school. She's a little -- she was a
little -- in a little bit older class than I. So this, we remembered. That we had a little bit
free time, and we were were doing the algebretical roots. So you know to keep the

think -- I might not have prayed in Bergen-Belsen. I might not have prayed. But I
prayed in Hamburg, because I remember it. And, I don't know whether it is, has
something to do with my upbringing, or whether it has something to do with my
spirituality. And I think that we have certain powers. Maybe powers is too strong a
word. But we were -- in the worst of times even, we have some abilities. Not in
Auschwitz maybe. Not in Bergen-Belsen. But we have some abilities. We have -- and I
think they are, maybe -- you could say they are God-given. And so I keep praying. I
keep praying. I keep -- actually, my way of praying is, if this is important, a way of

thanking God for what I want to have.

Q: Let me ask you one more question. And if there's anything you want to add. Have you
thought about what sort of long-term impact these experiences have had on you, and, and
have influenced the way you are today?

A: It is absolutely miraculous. I went, in the very beginning, after in Germany, through
some times which I was very -- I may be depressed, nervous, and so on. It's likely that,
having been blessed with two sons and two daughter-in-laws and four grandchildren, and
having worked also on my physical and emotional health through things like yoga and
others, I am, actually right now, in a very good, very good place emotionally. Because I
could talk about it and I could -- when my husband was testifying at UCLA [University
California-Los Angeles], there's no way I was able to testify. It still -- when I think about
it, even about testifying, especially about the ghetto, I was having butterflies in my
stomach. However -- and I cannot watch any -- anything on television about the
Holocaust. And when I watched the first time when there was a Holocaust story, I was
sick for quite a long time because I have a visual memory. And when I hear something,
it doesn't affect me so much. But when I saw it, I cannot see it. I cannot see. And I try --
since I don't do any good to anybody and I have my responsibilities -- so I try not to look.

Q: Can you think of how -- could you talk about it after the war?

A: No.

Q: It took you a while?

A: Yes, we couldn't talk about it. In the beginning, we just could not talk about it. And I
couldn't talk about it for quite a long time. And, my son was always -- when I started
talking quite recently, he was, was, like -- in a way, he was pleased that I talk about it.
He'd be very surprised that I was able to testify, with pretty much of a composure,
because I -- Dave was talking -- my husband -- I couldn't -- I was always, want to protect
everybody from everything. Now, I have a little number which I was wearing in the
camps. And my granddaughter wants it, she said, "Don't give it to anybody," she wants
it -- so probably -- I will show it to you -- probably when she will ever eventually give to
the Holocaust Museum.

Q: Can you think of any other way that these experiences have affected the way you've lived
for the last 50 years?

A: What really affected me is my upbringing. I was brought up to respect elderly people --
and I don't forget that I am one of them right now -- I was taught to be honest. I was
taught that you're supposed to be charitable. We never were taught to hate. And I think
it's not so much the experience. But the way I was brought up, there are certain things I
just would not do. I wouldn't do it. Because this period of time -- of course, it is a big --
it's not a void -- a hurt -- my main concern is actually whether when my -- especially, my
mother -- my father, of course, too -- when they went into this gas chambers, whether --

hopefully, they didn't suffer too much -- that is my very, very important concern. And I
do not want to investigate too much. Because I don't off -- on the one hand, in the
beginning, I was hoping it was instantaneous. But I understand it was not instantaneous.

Q: What are we looking at, Estelle?

A: This is a photograph taken in a spa which we spent the summer in. And there is my dear
mother, Hannah Ryba Weingarten (ph), my dear father, Yakaf Weingarten (ph). And
there is my dear, handsome brother, Herschlipe Weingarten (ph), we called him Lolick.
And that's me next to my mother. I was about five years old. And let me remember them
the way -- the way -- the way they were here, and not think that they were gassed in
Auschwitz.

Q: What are we looking at?

A: Oh. This picture was taken in Portumbina, where we had a summer home. And I am
picking up the balls and my brother, who is at the right, is playing with -- and his name is
Lolick Weingarten -- he is playing with Fishek,

my cousin. I mentioned his name because, before going to Auschwitz, after his family was
deported, he came to us and we tried to hide him. And there was no room in our cellar

for him. And there were already five people. And we hid him ina shack. But
unfortunately, the SS found him and took him to Auschwitz a few days before we went to
Auschwitz.

Q: What year do you think this picture was taken?

A: I must have been here, maybe, 10.

Q: So the early 1930s?

A: Yes, it would be in the early 1930s. (pause) On this photograph, on the left, standing, is
Felka (ph), my cousin, Felka Weingarten. And on the right is Ritcha (ph), Ritcha
Weingarten. And I am in front of Felka, and my brother, Lolick Weingarten, is in front
of Ritcha. Unfortunately, Felka perished in the Holocaust and Ritcha, her husband, and
her baby, perished in the Holocaust also. Rest their memory. (pause) This is my aunt,
Paula Rosenblum, a sister of my mother's. She perished in the Holocaust together with
her husband and three small children. (pause) This is my aunt Rucha Bondrypa (ph), who
played her piano beautifully, and she perished in Warsaw during the Holocaust.
