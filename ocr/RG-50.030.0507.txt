A: Different environment --
Q: -- di-different environment.
A: -- altogether.
Q: Uh-huh.

A: Mm-hm. She was a -- he was a perfectionist, and so was she. And if I came home with a
report card that had two B’s and all A’s, she would say, that’s not good, why don’t you have all
A -- B -- A’s on there. And my dad would say, that’s a pretty good report card. And that was the
difference between those t --
Q: Yes, so was that -- that must have been difficult for you as a child growing up, having these
expectations. Or -- or was it good for you? Do you know?
A: At that time it was good for me.
Q: It was?
A: Mm-hm. It became more difficult as I -- after. When I had to live with my uncle, who was
Mother’s brother, who was -- he was somewhere in the genius range.
Q: Really?
A: And he couldn’t understand why I couldn’t understand some things, or get some things as
quickly as he did.
Q: As he did. And of course you were much younger also, so --
A: Yes.
Q: -- the expectation was -- so it became difficult. You know, I forgot to ask you, what was your
father’s name?
A: Jacques -- that’s -- Jack is named after him. This is the French Jacques.
Q: Jacques, yes.
A: Theobold Alfred Karl Frederick.
Q: So it’s many names, and Cohen is the last name.

A: Because he had -- he was the last one in a row of five boys. There were five boys in that
family.
Q: But you -- you did say earlier that -- that each child, depending upon where they were in the
birth sequence, they would get more names? So your father had five names because he was the
fifth?
A: Yes, but I don’t believe they did that with the children before that.
Q: With -- but just with him.
A: With him. Because he was also the last one.
Q: I see. So he got all the names --
A: Yes.
Q: -- that they didn’t give to other -- was he known as Jacques?
A: Yeah.
Q: Or was he -- that’s -- that’s how he was known?
A: Yes.
Q: Did you notice when -- when you were growing up that your parents got along well, or --
because they seem so different. From your description --
A: Yes.
Q: -- they seem so very different. It seems as if it might be difficult in the house. Was it?
A: Yes [indecipherable]
Q: It was?
A: Mm-hm, sometimes.

A: They mostly talked to each other, they didn’t ask too many things --
Q: No, huh.
A: -- from us. That came later -- I mean later in the day, because we would always have tea about
an hour after dinner.
Q: I see.
A: And the tea we would have in our living room upstairs, whereas we had dinner in the kitchen,
downstairs.
Q: Uh-huh. And would your mother and father be upstairs at tea, or just your father with you?
A: Everybody --
Q: Everybody was --

sister or a brother.
Q: Right.
A: And I was eight years old at the time, and I thought I would have a sister just like me, just as
old as I was and everything. And so when I saw her in the crib in the hospital, and she was the
sister, well oh, I can’t play with her. I was very surprised.
Q: And you -- were you disappointed?
A: Yes, yes I was.
Q: Cause you expected to have someone who was your equal.

Q: Right. So your parents didn’t really explain to you that it was a baby that was going to
happen.
A: No, not at that time.
Q: Not at that time.
A: No.
Q: And so when you said to them, I can’t play with this, this is a -- this is a baby, did -- did they
think you didn’t -- that you should have understood? I mean, what did they do? Did they try to
explain it to you then, or not?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: No.
Q: So were you annoyed at this baby who can’t do anything?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. And did you became a babysitter pretty quickly?
A: Yes.
Q: So at age eight you’re taking care of a little teeny baby?
A: Yeah. And I had to take her to the park for walks.
Q: Uh-huh, right.
A: Spent the whole -- at that time we had no school on Wednesday afternoon.

Q: Uh-huh.
A: He was a young man in his 20’s and that’s all I knew.
Q: Right. But you didn't say to him, you know, I listen to you and it’s wonderful.
A: No.

Q: Betsy, the neighborhood that you lived in, I know that in Amsterdam there was a kind of
Jewish neighborhood, but you didn’t live in that neighborhood, right? You lived in a -- a mixed
neighborhood?
A: Yes.
Q: Were there many Jews who lived there, or not?
A: No.
Q: No, there weren’t.
A: It was -- was a little -- no, it was sort of a ritzy street --
Q: It was.
A: -- on which we lived. And the whole neighborhood, from our house to the school was sort of -
- not rich, but upper middle class.
Q: And would you remember the name of the street?
A: Oh yes.
Q: What was it?
A: Pieter de Hooch Street.
Q: Pieter de Hooch Street. Was your family religious?
A: No, my father was actually an atheist, and he taught me that so far as he was concerned, I
didn't have to do anything until I was 18, and then, he said then I could make up my mind, did I
want to be Jewish, did I want to be religious too. But Mother came from a more religious family.
But so that I didn’t go to school on the high holidays and I didn’t go to school on Passover.
Q: So -- go ahead. You were going to say something.

A: We didn’t -- we didn’t celebrate Chanukah because in Holland they celebrate Saint Nicholas,
and that is December the fifth. And he is not the Christmas man who comes here at Christmas,
no. He was a -- a saint from Turkey, and he helped poor children. He would -- as the legend
goes, he would throw food into the orphanage backyard, and he was supposed to come every
year from Spain, with his ship, and a black assistant, Schwartze Piet, and a white horse.
Q: Really?
A: That way he would come, every year.
Q: Uh-huh. So everybody celebrated --
A: Yes, ev-everybody.
Q: So was that a religious holiday in some way or not? It wasn’t terribly religious, was it -- is --
A: No, it was not at all religious. It was a fun day.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Everybody had parties, and it was a little bit of a tradition to write a little poem, when you
gave somebody a gift, and you could -- you could be very -- you could be criticizing the person
to whom you gave it, but make fun, in a fun way.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: So it was a really wonderful celebration. I never heard the word Chanukah until I came to the
States.
Q: Really? But you knew of other Jewish holidays --
A: Yes.
Q: -- because you did --
A: Yeah.
Q: So were you very conscious of being Jewish, or somewhat conscious, what do you think?

A: Well, it was my mother who made me conscious.
Q: Not your father.
A: And well, in retrospect, I can see what happe -- my mother kept saying to me I was Jewish
and I had to be careful because there were so many anti-Semites in the world.
Q: And she said that to you when you were quite young?
A: Yeah.
Q: What did you think about that?
A: I didn’t agree with her because I hadn’t -- I-I hadn’t felt any until the very last year, I used to
pick up two friends along the way to school. And the first ones were quite -- you know, did you
ever hear the word [indecipherable]? They were very conservative and the father came from a
family that had a plantation in the East Indies. So they were very well-to-do, but they were not
very friendly, they were cold. And so even was the girl whom I picked up, but I didn’t want to go
to school all by myself.
Q: Right. So at what point would -- we were talking about whether you ever experienced anti-
Semitism. Was she antis -- was that family anti-Semitic?
A: No, just cold.
Q: Just cold. So when your mother is warning you that there are a lot of people who are anti-
Semitic in the world, you just don’t find this to be the case, you’re not -- that’s not your
experience. It was --
A: No, that was not my experience --
Q: Right.
A: -- until Hitler came.
Q: Until Hitler came. And did your father hear that your mother was saying this to you?

A: Yes.
Q: And did he say to you, don’t pay attention, this is no --
A: No.
Q: He didn't say that.
A: He didn’t say that.
Q: Uh-huh. So did you say to him wh-why is she saying this, I don’t -- you know, where --
where are the anti-Semites?
A: No.
Q: Cause you're not -- you don’t -- no.
A: No.
Q: You didn't question that. So un -- when you’re a very young child, cause you’re born in 1928,
in 1933 the Nazis take over in Germany. So when you are six or seven years old, do you hear
about things that are happening in Germany?
A: We heard that the Jews were in plight there, and that they fled to Holland --
Q: Uh-huh, Holland, yes, right.
A: -- a lot. And --
Q: And so you heard that?
A: I-I heard that and I had a friend who was one of them.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: She became my bosom friend all the way through, as long as we knew each other.
Q: And did she tell you what was going on in Germany?
A: No, no.

A: No. There wasn’t that much talk --
Q: I see.
A: -- at that time.
Q: Right, right.
A: And the father was a lawyer and her mother was a -- a music teacher. And my friend herself
was very ta-talented. And I -- I always came, and he had to practice, but for me this was a
pleasure to listen to. And then afterwards she practiced, then we’d do our own thing, but --
Q: Right. So did you sit in the room when she was practicing?
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: You did? That’s very nice.
A: Oh yeah.
Q: So you really loved music, didn't you? Do you still love music?
A: Yes.
Q: Yeah.
A: Yes, oh yes.
Q: Now, let me ask you something. Bef -- before you were born, so you can only talk about what
you’ve heard, I think. Your parents didn’t live a-at Pieter Hooch Strasser, right?
A: No.
Q: They lived somewhere else.
A: Yes.
Q: And this has some significance because of a bakery that’s there.

Q: That your mother goes to. So can you talk about -- where did -- where did she go? She went
every day to buy some bread --
A: Yes, yes.
Q: -- from a woman who came to be known as Tante Toos to you, yes?
A: Yes.
Q: So how long did they live in this other place? Do you know? A few years?
A: Maybe four. That was a different neighborhood they were -- it was called the -- the old new
south.
Q: The old new south?
A: South, yeah. And somehow many of the German Jews settled around there, that
neighborhood.
Q: I see. But your mother had lots of conversations with this woman. Every time she went in she
would talk with her, is that correct?
A: Yes.
Q: Yes. So I-I’m just mentioning this because later on this woman is going to become extremely
important, in fact ends up saving your lives.
A: Yes.
Q: Yes. Do you hear about the anschluss in Vienna, in -- in Austria?
A: Yes.
Q: Because your grandparents were there, is this very -- di-did they stay in Austria, or did they
leave and come to Holland?

Q: And you don’t know what else happened, right. But did your mother’s brother Sam, who ends
up taking care of you when you come to the United States, he and his wife, does he come to stay
in your apartment?
A: Yes.
Q: He does.
A: Yes, he did stay with us for a year because I think he had to wait for a -- his quota number to
come up.
Q: I see. So when does he come? In 1940, 1939, do you remember?
A: Well, I was 10 -- 11.
Q: So it’s °38 - 739.
A: 20 -- 738 - °39, yeah.
Q: So he comes after the anschluss --
A: Yes.
Q: -- with the grandparents.
A: Yeah.
Q: So for awhile it’s your uncle and your grandparents that are in the house?
A: Well, my grandparents didn’t stay in the house very long --
Q: I see, so he stayed longer.
A: -- a year, and then they got their own apartment.
Q: So he stayed for longer than that?

A: Yeah.
Q: Now, was he trying to convince your parents to leave?
A: Oh yes.
Q: But they wouldn't do it?
A: Well, my father would have, but my mother thought she has a good job, and she expected a
big pension and why should she go and forsake all that? And so she was not ready to go.
Q: To do that. Did you know that at the time? Did you hear these conversations?
A: Yes.
Q: You did?
A: Some.
Q: Some of them. So were they arguing, was your -- was your uncle saying you must go because
Hitler’s going to do terrible things, or -- do you remember any of it?
A: No, I don’t think they were arguing.
Q: Uh-huh, you don’t.
A: No.
Q: So how did you know that your uncle was going to leave and he was asking your parents to
take you, the kids, and themselves out? Did you overhear these conversations?
A: No. Hitler came into Holland in May, ’42. When he occupied Holland, my father said to me,
if ever anything happens to us, get in touch with your Uncle Alfred in America.
Q: Do you think he told his -- hi -- his brother-in-law the same thing?
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

Q: So the Nazis take over in 1940 I believe, May of 1940, right? So your father -- but your father
tells you directly --
A: Yes.
Q: -- this, right. Did you want to leave? Did you --
A: No.
Q: You didn’t?
A: No.
Q: So you didn’t feel danger until the Nazis actual --
A: Well, until the last few months, because the -- the Wehrmacht, they had their offices, and they
took over the house right next to us. And when they were right next to us, and I saw them
wherever I walked, then I did get scared.
Q: Then you were sca --
A: And that was also the time that they told us to wear a star on our --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- on our garments.
Q: Right. But that’s a little bit later. When -- when you start -- you finish grammar school --
A: Yes.
Q: -- in 1939, is that right? And go to gymnasium?

Q: Is it 1939 or 1940?

Q: Uh-huh. Right, 1939. So at a certain point you can’t go to school, as a young Jewish girl,
right? You have to go to a Jewish school. The Nazis come in in 1940.
A: Yeah, they came and then after awhile they chased out all the Jewish --
Q: Right.
A: -- professors, and all the Jewish students, and they mi -- they took a building that used to be a
really Jewish school, but they took over that building, and people -- Jewish people from all over
Amsterdam were congregated there, and -- and classes were held there.
Q: Right. D-Do you remember when the Nazis came in to the Netherlands? When they marched
in? Do you have an --
A: No.
Q: -- do you have any recollection?
A: Ah, no, except that I did hear a lot of shooting.
Q: You did.
A: And because we had -- Amsterdam was at the time, a port at the [indecipherable] that little
inland sea that -- that the Netherlands has.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And it was a pretty big port, and well, if anything was happening there, we could hear it.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: So we could hear very much shooting. And then that died down, and at first they were very
friendly, and then came one bulletin after another banning the Jews.
Q: Had your uncle left by this time? Did he leave before the Germans came? Your Uncle Sam?
He had left.

country.
Q: Really?

them. Now, the border was marked off by -- what you have around the chicken coops, you

to the United States, or did you hear it --
A: Oh, we had been here sometime already when I heard that.

to a different street.
Q: Right.
A: And so far as I know, they had no contact any more, but they did.
Q: But they did. So they were clearly very close in some way in order to make these kinds of
plans.

Q: Let’s see, I think I’ve been confusing some things. I think that I said that it was Uncle Sam
who came to stay with you, but it’s not Uncle Sam, it’s Uncle Alfred, is that right? So it’s Alfred
Schwartz, who is the brother of your mother, who came to stay with you, and then with whom
you stayed when you came to the United States, is that correct?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay. So when you go with your mother and Hedy, your sister, you -- you don’t remember
whether you walked or whether you took a tram to Tante Toos?
A: Oh, they lived close by, we walked.
Q: You walked. It was close by, I see.
A: I mean, when I went from Oome Cor to Tante Toos, we definitely walked.

A: Toos --
Q: -- from your house, do you re -- do you have a recollection whether you were walking, or
whether you --

would have been more visible.
Q: Uh-huh, right, right.

A: On -- on --
Q: On the arm?
A: Yeah, arm.
Q: What was that like for you when -- when that first started, when you were walking?
A: Awful.
Q: It was awful.
A: And that’s when I got in touch with anti-Semitism, because I had the other chum in school
who was not Jewish. Her father also took her to school, and her father and my father became
friends, and we became friends, too. And after the star, she came to tell me that she couldn’t
walk with me any more, that her parents didn’t want her to walk with me any more because of
that star.
Q: What did you think?
A: Terrible.
Q: It was awful, huh?
A: That was hard.
Q: Did she feel bad, too, or did she just state, well this is what my parents say, this is what I have
to -- you don’t know, or y --

A: When I went into hiding.
Q: No, but when you -- when the s -- when you first have to wear the star.
A: Oh, I don’t remember.
Q: Remember. I think it was ’42. So you’re -- you’re not a kid. You are -- I mean, you’re a kid in
a certain way.
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: But you’re not a child child --
A: No.
Q: -- you’re -- you’re -- if it was 1942, so you’re 14 years old. So that was really hard on you,
cause you’re very conscious of who you are as a young person.
A: Yeah.
Q: Did anybody else do that to you?
A: No.
Q: And when you were walking on the street, and you had the Jewish star, people stare?
A: No.
Q: No, they didn’t. So did the Dutch treat you in a o-okay way as far as --
A: Yes.
Q: They did. Except for that one incident.
A: Yeah. There were a couple of h-homes that the Germans had occupied and the so -- some of
the Soviets were sitting outside in the front yard and I would pass with my star, and they would
whistle at me.
Q: They would whistle. What’d you make of that? It’s a little stran --
A: They were very young ones, very young soldiers, all of them.

Q: Uh-huh.
A: [indecipherable]
Q: So did you think they were whistling at you because you were a young, attractive girl?
A: Yeah.
Q: Not because you were wearing the star.
A: No, no, I don’t even think they saw the star.
Q: I see. So they were on your street?
A: Yes.
Q: Yuck, that must have been horrible.
A: Oh, it was.
Q: Yeah. So were you nervous when your mother took off the star that night when you were
going to walk to Tante Toos?
A: Mm-hm.
Q: And -- and think that you were very vulnerable?
A: Mm-hm. Yes.
Q: Did you have baptismal papers, I mean did your mother have some false papers for you?
A: No.
Q: So if she was stopped, they would have known you were Jewish.

Q: -- in Holland.
A: No identity card.
Q: Nothing. So when -- when you got to Tante Toos and you walked in, did you feel, i-if you can
remember, did you feel more secure, not secure, because you knew who this person was, and you
felt safer, or did --
A: And the set up was better, too.
Q: Excuse me, the --
A: The set up.
Q: The set up?
A: Yes. Because we could know beforehand when somebody was home to come. She -- the front
of the house was the store, the back of the house was a little bedroom and living room, kitchen.
Q: Right, right.
A: And the front of the store starts here, and just there was the door to the basement. So when
somebody came, we quietly went through that door.
Q: To the basement, uh-huh.
A: And when the store was closed, we could come in the living room.
Q: You could?
A: Yes, we could, unless a neighbor upstairs was always going to shave Uncle John. Did Hedy
tell you exactly who Uncle John was?
Q: No, tel -- you tell me. He was -- he was Tante Toos’s husband.

go outside?
A: No.
Q: No, you had to stay inside.

Q: Right. But still, this is a time when you know that the Nazis are there, this is extremely
dangerous. Now when -- wh-when you left her -- it’s her sister and brother-in-law, or her brother
and sister --
A: Her sister and brother-in-law.
Q: And brother-in-law. When they brought you back, was she aggravated with them, or did sh --
and -- or did she just welcome you and say okay, so it’s three people instead of two people?
A: Well, she welcomed me but reluctantly, because that was not the way it was supposed to be.
Q: Right, right. So she was better than the sister, wasn’t she?
A: Yes.
Q: But of course her circumstances were such that there was a place for you to hide, whereas
there wasn’t a place --
A: Yes.
Q: Yes.
A: Mm-hm.

A: Yeah.
Q: Did you look Jewish?

to be -- I mean, if somebody came and visited and they saw you, were you supposed to be a
relative? I mean, who were you supposed to be? Did you know?

and we were all getting friendly, the whole class was Jewish and Christian and -- and I had my
Jewish chum still, and -- no, I didn’t have her then, she was already gone. One time I went to see
her.

Q: Uh-huh.
A: We were always together. I went up there to see her, she lived on the third floor, across from
the grade school. And the neighbors across the hall came out and told me that she was picked up
by the Germans.
Q: So she was taken to Westerbork probably, and then deported. So that must have been really
awful for you.
A: Thad [indecipherable] a cousin for awhile, who was in the underground. She was walking
around with false papers and blonde colored hair. She somehow knew a person who was related
to the math professor in gymnasium. And this relative wrote a book on the students who all had
to go to that quickly established Jewish school. And he did a lot of research and -- with another
author. I should have brought the book. And he found out that she was killed in Auschwitz. Me -
- I still didn’t know until I got that book --
Q: Right. Is this Presser?
A: -- from him.
Q: Is this Jacques Presser, is that the professor?
A: Jacques Presser, no that -- Jacques was the history professor.
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. But you had him as a professor, yes?
A: Oh yeah. Oh, did I adore him.
Q: Yes.
A: How do you know his name?

A: He was fantastic.
Q: Really?
A: Because history is difficult to teach, and he made it come alive for us, he brought -- he
brought pictures. He was talking at the time about Greek and Roman architecture, which can be
boring.
Q: Right.
A: Ah, no, we got the pictures and he showed us the difference in -- little differences in
architecture.
Q: Right, right.
A: And then we had our workbook, and then we pasted in this thing --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- and you had to write something next to it.
Q: Right.
A: And it was fun.
Q: Right.
A: And he was nice. He was very nice.
Q: Uh-huh. So this -- this happens, of course, before you go into hiding.
A: Yeah.
Q: So you go into hiding and stop school because you go into hiding. Or -- or did school stop
before you went into hiding?
A: No, the school -- and that’s exactly what this relative of the other [indecipherable] remained,

Mother died right on that day, that night, but at the same time everybody began to get a little

Q: No.
A: No. A -- Tante Toos had another brother-in-law, who did see us, and that was about in the
March before they invaded. He -- he had a long talk with Tante Toos, telling her to get rid of us

Q: It -- in what way does it -- it -- it -- you mean the -- there -- they became less and less friends

mother was right, or there’s no right and wrong here?

not feel so happy.

his mother told white lies.
A: Yes.
Q: And that this bothered him, and that this brought you closer together. Can you explain why
that brought you closer together?
A: Well, we also had in common that we were teaching my sister. That was all at the same time,
and it was shortly after my mother died. You know, my mother died while we were hidden.
Q: Yes, I was going to ask you about -- right. So this -- this happened afterwards. So let’s -- let’s
go back then, and talk first about your mother. Was your mother ill when you went into hiding?
A: No, but she -- she wasn't ill, but did th -- before she died, she had these terrible headaches,
and they became worse and worse and worse and worse. And Tante Toos knew a doctor from the
underground, but we were all hoping, well, let’s see how it goes through the night. And then,
during the night, she expired. And this particular doctor, he saw to it that she got a grave at the
Jewish cemetery near Amsterdam.
Q: Really?
A: Well he must have, because there she is. And not only is she, but my grandmother and
grandfather, they’re there too. And I have no idea who -- there must have been several people
involved, to get her there.

A: Yeah, I woke up, my sister and I, we sleeping in one bed. I woke up and felt my mother was
too quiet and I felt her hand and it was ice cold, of course. So I started screaming, oh Hedy, now
we are whatyoumacalls, people without parents.
Q: An orphan.
A: Yeah.
Q: So you discovered that your mother was dead?
A: Mm-hm.
Q: She was sleeping in the same room with the two of you?
A: Right next to us, actually.
Q: Right next to you. Hm. Now, you didn't have a funeral, you were not -- they did -- they take
the body away, right?
A: No. No. And that same doctor, he arranged that her body was carried out and he really did a
great deal.
Q: He did.

A: Because he knew pretty soon -- pretty early that we were there. Yeah. I don’t know who knew
him, but evidently Tante Toos trusted him.
Q: So this was very -- very quick, diz -- whatever this was --
A: Yes.
Q: -- in your mother, it was -- it went very fast.
A: He si -- he thinks it was a -- a tumor in the brain.
Q: Mm-hm. Had she had headaches for a long time that you remember?
A: She always had some headache.
Q: She always had it, uh-huh.
A: But nothing unusual.
Q: But this -- these were really extreme, painful?
A: Yes.
Q: Now, in relationship to when she died, prior to her dying, there was a secondary hiding place
inside the apartment, right? There was a -- some sort of a false wall that was built.
A: Yes.
Q: How long before your mother died? Because she was there and hiding in that place with you.
A: Yes.
Q: Right? Was that a year before? Do you rememb -- do you have any recollection?
A: I'd say half a year before, but I don’t know exactly.
Q: Right.
A: Like I -- I don’t know, Hedy said there was a hiding place underneath the -- the window
where they displayed the bottles of gin, and whatever. Tho -- she said that was at first designated
as our hiding place, but I don’t recognize this at all, I don’t remember seeing --

Q: Right. Well, do you remember this other hiding place where this false wall was --
A: Oh yes.
Q: You do?
A: Oh -- oh yes, we were all in there, Hans too.
Q: And why was Hans there?
A: Hans was in there because the Germans wanted to have boys come to Germany and work in
the factories. And Hans went to some kind of -- because he wanted to become a telegraph
operator at sea, so he went to school for that, and that was one reason why he was still around,
but when they did go around, they would pick up these boys and send them to the factories in
Germany.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: So there were -- there was mother and my sister and Hans and | in a very small place.
Q: You would ha -- you would -- where was this inside the a -- the apartment? You’ve described
that behind the store was the living space.
A: Yeah.
Q: So what -- was it on that floor, that same floor as the -- as the store was?
A: Yes. Actually, there was a kitchen, and the ceiling was that high. Right next to the kitchen
was the bathroom, and the ceiling was much, much higher. And so they built a false wall.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: From the ceiling of bathroom, which was higher.
Q: So how much space is there?
A: Maybe two and a half feet by four feet. I can’t think of it now, I’m getting mixed up with the -
- I -- I forgot how to copulate cu -- how many cubic feet those are. It’s small, extremely small.

Q: Could you sit, or did you have to stand?
A: We could sit, but we have to pull up our legs and --
Q: And how many hours would you stay there, usually?
A: It differed. Sometimes only half an hour, and sometimes two and a half hours.
Q: And this was when -- when you would be warned that -- that Germans were coming?
A: Yes, mm-hm.
Q: And once the Germans were gone, then you could come out?
A: Yeah.
Q: And do you know who would warn Tante Toos that somebody was coming? Do you have any
idea?
A: It might be Uncle Cor, I mean, that was her closest link to the underground. But it might also
have been word of mouth. I -- I couldn’t tell you.
Q: Right. Was Hans connected with the underground at all as time went on?
A: No.
Q: He wasn’t?
A: No.
Q: Not at all.

A: Mm-hm.
Q: Why?
A: Well, we were pretty close together and at that age, what do they call it? Puppy love.
Q: Mm. And so that’s what you think it was?
A: Yeah.
Q: But this must have been good for you in some way? No?
A: No, it wasn’t.
Q: Oh, it wasn’t.
A: Because a-at that time, he didn’t fall in love with me.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: We were close friends, but he didn't fall in love with me until after the war. He had the close
friend who came, and he paid attention to me, and Hans became jealous. And then Hans decided
he was in love with me, and we were going to get married.
Q: You were?
A: Yeah. Hans was going to get the job at sea, and then he’d pick me up, and then get married,
and I’d be in Amsterdam. But just the fact that he was at sea, he wrote me pretty soon that he
saw a girl in Hamburg, and they were going to get married. And that was that.
Q: And that was the end. So he wrote -- this is after the war, he wrote to you and said this?
A: Yeah. For a long time he wrote almost like we are going to get married. I mean, that was
really the real thing, but then suddenly came that letter that --
Q: I see.
A: And he saw this girl in Hamburg.
Q: But you remained in love with him for -- you were pretty constant?

A: Yeah, I was pretty constant.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: I was pretty constant, but I was -- but his friend was really the better one, only at the time I
didn’t realize it.
Q: His friend was better for you?
A: His friend was better for me than Hans.
Q: Than Hans, uh-huh.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: Was he your first boyfriend?
A: You could say that. When I was still in school, there was a minister living upstairs with his
family and he took in borders, medical students a lot. And he had a nephew coming in who was
my age. And nephew and I talked a little bit about things. That -- that was the closest I came to a
boyfriend --
Q: Right.
A: -- at that time.
Q: Right. Now that your mother is no longer alive, is -- does Tante Toos become a -- a mother
figure for the two of you, or do you become the mother of Hedy at this point? I mean, what --
what -- what happens now that your mother is not there?
A: My father had always said, if something happens to everybody, that I should take care of my
little sister. Tante Toos felt that she was the mother, and it made her feel good. And -- and Hedy
responded very -- very well to her, but it was I who had to take her to the doctor, it was I who
had to go downtown with her, get her new clothes, and she get her shoes repolished. I was really

closer so far as care giving is concerned. And Tante Toos was -- she gave us a roof over our head
and food to eat.
Q: But now you’re talking about the time when the war is over, when you can leave. I’m
wondering before the war is over --
A: Yeah.
Q: And you’re still in the house --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- and you can’t go out.
A: No, not yet, and half an -- about four months later, Uncle John died.
Q: Uh-huh, after your mother.
A: Yeah, after my mother.
Q: I see.
A: Was very short, yeah. We lost two people. But Uncle John was old.
Q: Was old. How old do you think he was?
A: I think he was 82, and was very much paralyzed --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- by strokes.
Q: Right.
A: And he couldn’t speak very well, and he had to be helped to bed, and to the bathroom.
Q: I see.
A: And f -- we fed [indecipherable]

Q: Uh-huh.
A: So when we came to the living room to eat, he was there.
Q: I see.
A: He was always there when we were in the living room, although on a one to one relationship
with him, I think none of us had.
Q: Uh-huh. And was he the -- the only husband of Tante Toos? This is -- this is the father of
Hans? So it’s not --
A: Yeah.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And Hans has -- had two half brothers from that first wife. Two half brothers and one half
sister, and the half sister -- the brothers were caught in the Dutch East Indies. They were caught
by the Japanese. And the [indecipherable] sister, she lived in the city not too far, and she also
came to visit Tante Toos.
Q: Hm. Okay. So when -- when you were in the house, a-again, now that the -- Tante Toos’s
husband is dead, and your mother is dead, does she become more of a mother figure inside the
house, or she remains the same for you?
A: She remains the same.
Q: She remains the same. And do you begin to take even more care of Hedy even though you’re
-- you’re in the house? Is that difficult for you? I mean, you’re now -- how old are you? You’re
16 in 1944, and she’s eight. That’s a big responsibility as a 16 year old, isn’t it?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you resent it?
A: No.

Q: No.
A: No. Because she -- she was not a brat at the time, and she realized what was going on. And on
top of that, after the war, when she went to school, she became very ill with whooping cough and
pneumonia, and she had to spend several months in the hospital, several months before it all
cleared up, because we were all undernourished.
Q: Yes. That -- was that last year a very difficult year because it was such a bad winter in 1944
and °45 --
A: Yes.
Q: -- in -- in -- in the Netherlands?
A: Yes, it was a very bad year because the Germans, as they withdrew, took all the food from the
farmers, everything they could. And all -- all the art that they could find, and sometimes they
burned houses behind them as they withdrew. And we were isolated. Whatever food there was
went to the German army.
Q: So how did you get food? What did you eat?
A: We got one little loaf of bread, from whatever that was made we don’t know. And maybe two
potatoes.
Q: This is a week?
A: And that -- but Tante Toos had connections, you see, and she had connections with people
who sold eel, smoked eel, which is a delicacy in Holland, and with people who ha -- had the
pastry shop. And maybe a baker. Couple of people that she changed then her little bit of gin or
whatever it was, because she got less, too, she exchanged it then for food.
Q: Was she still getting these ration -- with this fake ration books, so she could use it, or was that
not even done any more?

Q: But it still went throughout -- until the war was over?
A: Oh yes.
Q: Yes.
A: Yes.
Q: But it became harder and harder --
A: Yes.
Q: -- to [indecipherable] food. Do you -- do you remember being very hungry?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: No. Actually, when I came in there, and I had to stay in the house, like [indecipherable] I got
very heavy, and when there was not so much food, my weight dropped, and I was not sorry. But
I didn’t realize that I was undernourished.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: It came out later on in different ways, but no I didn’t really feel -- that the worst feeling was
of being isolated, knowing that the other kids were growing up and going through the classes,
and seeing the wa -- the professors, and social life, and it was out. I didn’t have it.
Q: So you felt deprived?
A: I felt very much deprived that way. Of course I missed my father, too. We were very close.
Yeah, I felt out of it, you know?
Q: You felt out of it? But around you, you were seeing a s -- a -- a kind of normalcy of the non-
Jews --

was more n -- it was normal, what -- in other words, the people who weren’t hiding like you,
were they living a more normal life as far as you were you concerned? Do you think?
A: Well, not a hundred percent. Socially they were.
Q: Mm.
A: That’s what I was thi -- I felt isolated from the other kids --
Q: Kids.
A: -- who were growing up, who were going classes.
Q: Right.
A: Going out together, had picnics together, and got to know people, and here I was.

over soon?
A: Yes.
Q: And then it wo -- then it seemed sure that it would be over?
A: Yeah.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Yeah, people have great hopes. That’s why it was so difficult in the wintertime when there
was no food, and people had hope. Somehow the Red Cross in Sweden could get airplanes over
Holland and throw down white bread, a couple of times, during that bad time. How they got
there, I don’t know. Was dangerous. But -- and even after the war, they helped us out with white,
good bread.

Q: You don’t.
A: No, all I knew was that we didn’t hear any more stories about them. And toward the end
there, there was -- well, Tante Toos says come out on the street, that is very quiet, is nobody
here. A-And that must have been May the fourth, or something like that. So we went out on the
street, it was quiet, no tanks, no heavy footsteps, those German marching footsteps. And it was
just uncanny. So that’s when we knew there are something going on.

Q: Betsy, could you re-describe the scene when Tante to -- Toos says it’s clear, there’s n --
there’s nobody here, come out. What -- what did -- what is it that you see? Do other people start
coming out?
A: Mm-hm.
Q: So describe the scene that you -- that you remember.
A: Well, it’s tra -- it’s a very wide street in a newer -- ne -- at that time, newer part of
Amsterdam. And there are s-stores all on the first floor, and apartments on top of the store. And
people came out of the doors [indecipherable] talking to each other, exchanging news. There’s
one thing that happened during the war that I think that it made me a whole different person. The
Germans were going through that town again, looking for Jews, and they were in our street th --
for the first time. And we were about two houses -- two stores away from the end of the block.
So they came from the other side and searched all the houses, and when they reached the end of
the block before ours, they stopped, they were finished. They went home.
Q: They just left?
A: Well, that was not yet when they withdrew, I mean --
Q: Right, right.
A: -- they were still doing their jobs.
Q: Right. But they didn’t come to your street.
A: They didn't come to that block. Now, I think that’s a wonder.
Q: And what was the street named that you were hiding on. What were -- were -- were Tante
Toos living?
A: Jan Svertsenstraat.

Q: And that was in this -- in the -- the new --
A: Newer.
Q: Newer part of Amsterdam.
A: Of Amsterdam.
Q: Is that in the south of Amsterdam?
A: Southwest.
Q: Southwest. So when are you sure that the Germans are gone?
A: I think the ships in the harbor, they started blowing the horns. And at -- that -- that was
announced over the radio.
Q: So do you remember feeling relieved?
A: Yes, sure. But you know, I thought how wonderful, the war is over. It was a terrible war, now
we are always going to have peace. That’s what I really thought.
Q: It’s understandable. You’ve been disappointed, I would gather, yes. What did you thi -- what
was one of the first things that you did? Did Tante Toos want to adopt you when the war was
over? Did you s -- did you speak about staying with her, or -- or what?
A: This is a long story. Again, we hadn’t talked about it. It was -- we were going to stay with her
until we went to Uncle Alfred. But during this time, I went to see -- me and my friend who
wasn’t supposed to walk with me in the star, where she was. Well, her parents had this sort of a -
- a sewing hand embroidery store. And she was not in the country, she was studying to be a
pharmacist somewhere else. So I talked to the parents. And they asked how we were, and they --
they wanted to know how things were set up, and how we slept, and wh-where the -- see where

the coal was, you see, because a basement was usually for coal, anthracite. And they were just
wondering were we right next to the coal, or what. Okay, fine, I-I didn’t see them any more, I
didn’t hear from them any more. One day a social worker comes in. Are Betsy and Hedy Cohen
living here? Yeah, why? Can I see them? Sure. So she came to us in the back and she said, you
cannot stay here. This is no way of living for you, in the basement. Hans slept in the basement,
too. There was a partition, curtains. And with a young man sleeping there, we find that’s not
right. And we all put up a big stink.
Q: And what did y -- this was a she, this social worker?
A: The social worker was a she.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: She came that once and told us, and I think there was a phone call that we should go and then
there was a letter and how did they know where we were? Because of the parents of that -- that
friend.
Q: Was Tante Toos there also when she said these things?
A: Yes. Now she -- she had an answer, she -- she was right up there, and then Hans was there,
we all di -- and even Uncle Schaap, and he said no, th-they should stay and -- but that was really
something. I go to these parents in good will, and they send a social worker out after us.
Q: Now what -- was your intention that -- from the very beginning, was Tante Toos told that if
something happened to your parents that you would be contacting your Uncle Alfred and --

Q: What’s her name, the aunt’s name?

Q: Yeah.
A: Annie.
Q: Annie. So Tante Toos knew this?
A: Yes.
Q: But here she is being with you folks for three years, living every day --
A: Mm-hm.
Q: -- with you two kids. Does she want you to stay? Does she not want you to go?
A: I think in a way, she wanted us to stay, because she always kept saying, well, ’m your
mother, you know. On the other hand, I think that she didn't want that Hans and I would become
too close. And it turned out that she didn’t want that Hans and any girl became too close. So
Hans fell in love with a girl who came from the -- a social worker, who came from the East
Indies. Her family came over -- she -- her family was invited over, the government invited them
over to come. And Tante Toos was prejudiced against this girl. But this was the real girl, so they
waited until she died, and then they got married.

took us to the train station early in the morning, one morning.
Q: And did you each have a suitcase?
A: Yes. We also had the trunk.
Q: A trunk?
A: Yeah. Now, I don’t know where the pieces of this trunk [indecipherable] any more, but --
Q: Did you take anything that your mother had brought? Did she bring anything from the house
into Tante Toos’s house? Nothing.
A: No chance. They -- evidently they -- they did the basic, most important things. Linen,
blankets, the beds.
Q: Your actual beds were in Tante Toos’s house?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you remember them leaving your apartment and getting --
A: No.
Q: No.
A: I don’t know how they got there.
Q: It’s so odd, because you were living in the apartment --

Q: -- yes, right?
A: Yeah.
Q: So there was a certain familiarity in Tante Toos’s house because you actually had some of
your own things.
A: Yes.
Q: So in the trunk are clothes?
A: And some linen.
Q: And some linen.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: And did Tante Toos give you something when you left?
A: Yes.
Q: What did she give you?
A: She had a little lamp standing on a sewing machine. It was a little Arab sitting on the leaves --
some leaves which are gone by now, and some kind of shelter over his head. And he was
smoking a very long pipe. I fell in love with -- I li -- I still do, I like little lamps like that. And
she knew that, and she gave me the lamp.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And she also gave me yi -- what Jack mentioned, that little windmill. Was a little windmill
about this big, made out of little sticks of wood. But it didn’t withstand the times. The boys put
the fingers in the window, and pushed it a little bit, and it started falling apart.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: It was old.

Q: Even then it was old?
A: Yeah.
Q: Mm-hm. So who took you to the train station if Tante Toos didn’t? Did Hans take you?
A: Hans and Uncle Schaap.
Q: Uh-huh. And did your uncle want to leave as well, or did he not? Your Uncle Schaap.
A: Did -- did he want to do what?
Q: Leave.
A: Yeah, he thought it was better for us to leave.
Q: And did he want to leave as well, or he didn’t want to?
A: No. No, he was an older man.
Q: I see.
A: But --
Q: And was he in hiding in --
A: Yes, he was in hiding --
Q: -- in the Netherlands also?
A: -- somewhere in the country.
Q: And he’s your father’s brother. His eldest brother, is that right?
A: He is my father’s cousin’s --

A: And -- and -- and the wife was the blood relative, and she did not. But she is a very, very
warm [indecipherable]
Q: Uh-huh. But they both survived?
A: Yes.
Q: Was this one of the few people in the family that survived?
A: Yeah. Uncle Schaap, and Tante Schaap and Betsy.
Q: And that was it.
A: You know, my cousin Betsy.
Q: Yes, and that was it. And this is a pretty big family that you had.
A: It was actually, you call fi -- four brothers and their families.
Q: Right.
A: And they all had something in Amsterdam. One brother was a tailor, and he made my father’s
suits, because my father had the hunchback.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: So that he was actually the only one who could really make a suit for my father.
Q: Was it a very severe hunchback?
A: Yes.
Q: It was?
A: Mm-hm. Yeah, the story goes that his mother dropped him when he was still very small.

deal for him?
A: Well, he took it pretty well, he wasn’t complaining. No, he was -- I knew [indecipherable]

A: Hedy got si --

Q: Sick. You didn’t?
A: Well, I got something else. I walked in the rain to school, and the top of my shoes were wet,
and they were rubbing against the skin of my foot, and they were rubbing it open. And it just
didn’t heal. And I had to stay home, I had to keep my feet up. The doctor tried everything under
the sun.
Q: And it didn't heal?
A: It didn’t heal for five months or something like that. And the last treatment I remember is that
he put silver on it.
Q: Silver?
A: Mm-hm. I read that sometimes it’s used, silver for healing.
Q: Right. And did that work?

Q: Oh, you did?
A: I got seasick, but Hedy got sick. Yeah, she got bronchitis and pneumonia.

Beginning Tape Six

Q: What kind of a ship was it that you were on?
A: A French -- a converted French freighter. And the conversion was done in the place where all
the luggage goes. What they did was they put beds in there. And i-in the middle was a -- a sort of
-- it’s almost look like a little podium. And on the one side we had the girls, on the other side we
had the boys, and there were no curtains or anything, so that -- and the beds were two ba -- on
top of each other. And -- and it was not -- we had no hot water, we had to wash with s-sea water.
Well, you can’t wash with sea water. It doesn’t -- it just doesn’t --
Q: It doesn’t work?
A: -- work. And it was crowded, and we were not the only people. We -- we orphans were not
the only refugees, there were more adult refugees from Poland, and even a professor from
Holland who was not a refugee. He was going to teach at -- at Boston. And we had long
discussions because downstairs it was no -- there was no ventilation. And so we stayed on that as
long as we could, and -- that freighter, when they came to New York there was a big scandal and
got into the papers that this ship was converted, but it certainly didn’t have the standards that
they were supposed to have. And the food was terrible, besides I was seasick, yeah, I didn’t eat
much. And -- and he was jailed, the captain was jailed.
Q: Really?
A: That was in the New York papers, I understand.
Q: And why was he jailed, do you know?
A: Because he -- he had this ship, and he took all these people, and he knew -- he was paid for,
but he knew that he was way below the standard of a passenger ship.
Q: How long were you on the ship?

A: Three weeks. After one week, one engine died. After two weeks, the second engine died. And
we went on one engine this last part, and that’s why it took so long.
Q: So this wasn’t a great introduction for you, was it?
A: No.
Q: Did you s -- did you see the Statue of Liberty when you came in?
A: Yes.
Q: Was that nice to see? Was that important in some --
A: Yeah, that is exciting.
Q: It is?
A: Because that is -- that seemed to us a symbol of the United States.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: The United States, the freedom, justice. Now, we were standing there, crying.
Q: Crying, yes? And was Hedy okay? Was she well by then, by the time you --
A: Yes.
Q: She was okay. And did she see the Statue of Liberty, too?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.

A: My aunt. My uncle was there, but he couldn’t wait for three weeks. He -- they couldn’t take
three weeks off from work, so he had to go back to work.
Q: So she waited for three weeks?
A: Yeah.
Q: Really?
A: Because that ship was supposed to come at a certain date, and it didn’t, and she stayed.
Q: Hm.
A: We stayed in a hotel after that, but she had friends in -- in New York, and I suppose she
stayed with them before we came.
Q: But when you came she went to a hotel with you?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you then take a bath?
A: Yes, and we learned a lot of things that are different.
Q: Like what?
A: Like in -- i-i-in the Netherlands, in the wintertime it gets m -- humid and cold, and people
wear woolen underwear and longjohns. And [indecipherable] will wear woolen panties. And she
told us to forget about all that, because we were going to be living in centrally heated houses or
buildings, and we would be -- we would not be needing that kind of underwear any more. And
she told us about deodorant. We didn’t have any. I guess it wasn’t necessary.
Q: But now you were supposed to use it?
A: Yeah. And she told us about putting hand lotion on after you -- after you wash your hands, so
your skin doesn’t get rough. And I think she told us, never go barefoot on the floor, because you
get athlete’s foot. We never heard of that.

dainty, very nice. And she came when she saw me, and she said, you never wrote me a thank you

that’s all I remembered, and I didn’t really know her at all. And she didn’t know us, and she had
a difficult job. And, you know, in retrospect, they never had any kids.
Q: So here comes a 10 year old and an 18 year old.
A: And an 18 year old Dutch. And I was always called the stubborn Dutch girl, always. Hedy is
stubborn.
Q: But you were called stubborn?

Q: Were you stubborn?

much older? Were they in their 50’s or 60’s?
A: No.
Q: No.

Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- before we came. And in the letters she was very, very warm, yeah. And she -- she -- she
was warm.
Q: Mm-hm. So did you come to like her very much? Or was that difficult?
A: That was difficult. One thing is that I already had most of my manners, and some -- my
personality was pretty well formed. I mean, it was not that you couldn’t change anything, but it
was mo -- more difficult to work with an 18 year old than with a 10.
Q: Right.
A: And I -- they always had something to say, everything was wrong. They wanted me to be a
perfect American girl, the all American girl, one, two, three. Hair different, dress different,
everything.
Q: So this was difficult for you?
A: Mm. It was not difficult for Hedy. She fit right in. I didn't want to have them harp on me all
the time, and they were. They wanted to turn me into a very attractive American girl, which I
wasn’t.
Q: Did you say anything to them?
A: No, I did not. And that I had left over from the war. I felt if I would start saying something,
they would throw us out. And they wouldn’t have, but that was in my mind. One time, when I
said -- contradicted Tante Anne, Uncle Alfred came flying down the stairs. How did you dare to
contradict your Aunt Annie? That was the first time that I had said something, I forgot what.
Yeah, they became quite desperate with me, and I was put in the senior year of the high school,

to different technical schools, and they told them they -- they told the school principal they didn’t
know what to do with me any more, and the counselor. And there was a school psychologist who
gave me a couple of tests. And they told me -- they told them to send me to college.
Q: Wait a minute, say this again, they what? The -- they -- the --
A: This -- they told me to send them -- to send --
Q: Send you to college?
A: -- me to college. The college was right behind the high school that I went to. There was -- and
-- and not to worry, and send her to college.
Q: Did that make you feel good?
A: Oh yeah.
Q: Mm.
A: Yeah. Of course, I didn’t know exactly what college would be like, because in the
Netherlands, when you graduate from the secondary school, you go to the university. You are a
student already, you are almost a grown up. And a college here is not yet for grown ups. But I
liked it.
Q: What sort of culture shock was there for you in coming to the United States?
A: All the food you could eat, all the bananas everywhere. All these pastries all over the place.
The automatic [indecipherable] we had a little bit of that in Amsterdam, one little spot which

from winter, the distances are bigger, everything is so big and wide. And the other culture shock
part of it was that I was -- I couldn’t speak too well yet, but I heard what all the other girls were
saying [indecipherable]. They were saying, oh I’m so tired, oh I’m so tired. I got to say that later
too, but at that time -- and then they were talking about, did you see him? He asked me out for
Saturday, and did you see her clothes? They didn’t fit at all. Well, I -- I couldn’t understand how
16 - 17 year old girls could talk like that. They are more mature in Holland. They were. Things
have changed.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: But at that time, when you were 16 - 17, you were pretty serious student, no matter where you
were. And you -- and you don’t talk about somebody else’s clothes, or -- or guys, or -- yeah,
guys of course, once in awhile, but not all the time. And they never talked about a book they had
read, or more serious things. And I could not -- I could not understand it.
Q: Do you understand it now?
A: Yeah. Well, I see where they’re coming from.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And I think some of them have become more serious, some of the teenagers, because of the
conditions we find ourselves in now. They realize it. But, of course, that was a pretty golden time
for the States, 1950 -- 1946 - 1947. They had everything they wanted.

enough, I don’t work fast enough, I -- if I don’t have a date calling back it’s my fault. And after I
left the house and went to private school, what did they say to my sister? Why don’t you study?
Betsy always studied. Why don’t you do this well? Betsy always did that well.

Q: And did Hedy tell you that --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- this was what they were saying? You must have been shocked.

in the Netherlands, what happened? No. Not the teachers? Nobody?

Q: You don’t like to a -- you don’t like to be to -- asked where you’re going.
A: Where I’m going, wh-where -- who am I visiting. That’s what we are asked at the border.
And on the way back, what did you bring, who gave you something, what was it, what was the
value? I don’t like that. And that is from the war.
Q: It reminds you.

Beginning Tape Seven

Q: Betsy, when -- when did you actually start talking about your experiences during the war?
Only in the f-family, or did you talk in di -- in other places?
A: I did a little bit in college, because people would ask, where were you during the war -- the
Jewish people.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: So I told them I was hidden during the war. Just Jewish people. And my doctor in Windsor
somehow knew about it through Roseanne because he’s ro -- my daughter --
Q: Right.
A: -- he’s her doctor, too, and he -- he went down and sat with me and wanted to know
everything, before, you know, he became [indecipherable] and wanted to know how it was and
how I felt. Yes, in college I didn’t do much about. I told you I spoke at the PTA meeting once,
but I -- yes, I was asked to speak at the PTA meeting when I was in high school, but I was asked
to speak about Holland. So I had to do research because things had changed already.
Q: Right.
A: So I spoke about Holland, but not about my experiences.
Q: Did you -- when you -- when your kids were born -- you have three children, did you -- when
they reached a certain age, did you tell them about your experiences? Or only when they were
older?
A: Well, they all knew about it, but gee, I don’t remember if I told them, or my husband. They
all had different reactions, though. No, I don’t think I went down and sa -- and told them, like
you know, like we are talking.
Q: Mm-hm.

A: No. No. But then the boys got older and they started asking more questions and then I gave
them more answers.
Q: Right. But you say that they all have different reactions. What are the -- what are the different
reactions that they have?
A: Jack is very interested in the experiences. He also wants to see where I went to grade school.
He wants to see the house we were in, and the Germans next door. And by the way, in that
house, in the front room under the floor are still several jars of jam that my mother put there, but
she never had the chance to get them out. And if nobody changed that floor, they are still there.
Q: They are still there. This is the original, the -- the house that you grew up in?
A: No, that was the house where we lived before the hiding.
Q: Uh-huh, right.
A: Yeah. The offices were downstairs, and --
Q: Right.
A: -- I don’t -- I don’t think she had any help, I think she did that all by herself. Cut -- cut the
piece out of the floor and put the --
Q: Put the jam in. Why did she put it there?
A: Well, you were not supposed to horde any more, so that was one reason. And she wanted to
have it, though. She thought it was important to have.
Q: Mm-hm. Hm. And Roseanne, what’s her response?
A: I don’t want to be Jewish any more, because I don’t want to go to a concentration camp.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Now that was all the way through, all the way through until maybe just a year ago. She has a
10 year old daughter who sings in a choir, and the choir is the Windsor [indecipherable] opera

choir, so everybody’s in there. And Roseanne thought around Christmastime there were too
many songs about Jesus. And she told them so. She said, I don’t do Christmas, I am Jewish. You
shouldn’t just think -- but Roseanne has a way of saying things [indecipherable] make angry. So
now she’s got to come to a meeting, there are going to be board members there of that opera
situation. Now, that’s the first time that she has come forward to say that she’s Jewish. Before
that, she didn’t want to have anything to do with it. She didn’t even look for Jewish guys ever,
ever. She had two bad marriages. Mark, that’s the middle one.
Q: That’s your son, yes.
A: He was very interested. He was very interested. He went to Israel when he graduated from
college and he stopped in Amsterdam. My cousin was still alive, my cousin Betsy. And he
wanted her to take him to the old [indecipherable] synagogue there that I-I even haven’t seen.
And he wanted to know a lot about the time.
Q: Mmn-hm.
A: But he has become ultra-Orthodox, and so now he’s more interested in making me Orthodox.
But he has the empathy. He definitely has the empathy.
Q: Mm-hm, for your experience, uh-huh, yeah.
A: Yes. He is a very sensitive person, he ought to be a social worker or a psychologist, but he
cleans the shule.
Q: Mm-hm. And he lives in Israel? He lives in Israel?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yes.
A: With eight children.
Q: Eight?

A: Mm-hm. He lives in -- on the West Bank, the disputed territory. And I’m the mother, so
excuse me, but I think Mark is very smart.
Q: He’s very smart?
A: So is Jack.
Q: Yeah.
A: But Mark is in a different way. He seems to pick it up out of the air. He was good student, and
he’s just that smart.
Q: So let me ask you, you -- you were not feeling very much Jewish identity during the war.
A: No. No.
Q: What about after the war?
A: Passover?
Q: No, after the war.
A: After the war?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Well, e-everything changed. All I knew was matzoh at Passover, no bread. And not going to
school during the high holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. And that’s all I knew. Oh, I
also knew that Jews sometimes ate different foods, but I didn’t know how different until we
came to the States and Uncle and Aunt -- Uncle being Mother’s brother, being family of
Schwartz’s [indecipherable] was pretty religious. And they belonged to the Conservative
synagogue. And we had to stay home from school and go to all the services.
Q: So was this part of your culture shock?
A: No. What disappointed me was that the women had to sit on the balcony, and there was no air
conditioning, and it was September in Rochester and it was hot. I thought I’d die. And so there

was so much Hebrew. I hadn’t learned any Hebrew. Now I’m beginning to feel I should know
more, but at that time, they talk Hebrew, well, I was daydreaming.
Q: Did they send you to Hebrew school?
A: No.
Q: They didn’t.
A: You mean in Holland?
Q: No.
A: Oh.
Q: In Rochester, when you moved there.
A: No.
Q: No. Did they send ha --
A: No.
Q: No.
A: No.
Q: Neither of you.
A: But Hedy became a Sunday school teacher in the Reform synagogue because she got to know
some guy. And so he got -- she became a Sunday school teacher, so she learned very much more
about Judaism quickly, where she start keeping to everything. And like I said, with Uncle and
Aunt, I learned -- bagels were new, bagels I had never heard of. And -- and -- and smoked he --
smoked salmon, I didn’t know anything about. And such thing as [indecipherable], which my
husband’s sister make very good [indecipherable] and I -- I had never, never seen that.
Q: Did you like it?
A: Yes. And the only way you could eat matzohs in Holland was with butter and sugar over it.

Q: Butter and sugar?
A: Yeah. Very fine sugar. Not powdered sugar, a sugar in between. And that does taste good.
Q: Really? Pll try it.
A: Yeah.
Q: So do you think that in s -- that because of being in this household where it was more
religious than you grew up, that you became more identified with je -- with Judaism, or it’s just
that you were -- it was clear you were Jewish and that was it? Were -- did you -- did you go to
synagogue more once you were --
A: Yes, I did.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And the reason why I did, and especially [indecipherable] they had Rabbi Phil Bernstein, and
Philip Bernstein wrote a book which is called, “What do Jews Believe?” It wa -- it was a long
time ago, but it was a bestseller. And his sermons were just out of this world. So I went out of
my own will, I went every Friday in my last year of college, cause he was inspiring.
Q: Well, that’s interesting.
A: Yeah.
Q: And when you got married, did you go to synagogue? Or did you send your kids to
synagogue?
A: We always landed in a neighborhood that was far from the Jewish community, because we
moved around a lot. And even in Windsor, I lived in Windsor east, the Jews lived in Windsor
south, but we couldn’t afford the homes there. So the children were really not exposed much,
except that we sent Jack and Mark to Sunday school in Mansfield at the time, which was about
12 miles away from us, Mansfield, Ohio. And Jack was ready to be Bar-Mitzvahed, but he didn’t

want to be Bar-Mitzvahed. And when Mark was in college, he became almost a born again
Christian. He happened to have a friend who was, and his friend’s mother and I met through
unusual circumstances and became close friends. But she got Mark. She got them to go with her
to Washington to the Peace March and all the things that they do. And my husband said, I don’t
like that. And then my husband read in the Jewish news that there was going to be some kind of
Jewish meeting in New York City, but you didn’t know how Jewish. So he went there, and he
met Rabbi Hecht. Rabbi Hecht was very ultra-Orthodox, and he was -- his work was to reach out
to the students. And he got Mark. And now Mark is Orthodox.
Q: Right.
A: And it’s really unusual because we -- we didn’t have mu-much contact with Jewish people
when we -- in Cleveland, yeah. But then, when we had to move to those small communities,
there were hardly any Jews. And it was a hardship to take him every Sunday to Sunday school,
especially if one of them didn't want to. So Roseanne was not very much -- we couldn’t show her
very mu -- didn’t show her very much. But she had her own reasons for not wanting to be
Jewish, you know.
Q: Right, right.
A: So that’s how it worked with the kids. I think Jack identifies with us as being Jewish, but he
wanted to show his daughter what the high holidays were like, and he brought her to a synagogue
in L.A., and they told him you can’t come in unless you pay 500 dollars. That was --
Q: And that was the end. Have you ever talked about your experiences to schoolchildren, have
you ever been invited to do that, or wanted to do it?
A: No. But the Jewish center got to know about me through Mark, who was a -- a member there,
active member. A-An -- and -- and -- and about my -- he talked about my background, and they

have a Yom HaShoah -- they have a few days ago in the Conservative synagogue, the Reform,
and there’s little one, ultra-Orthodox. And some [indecipherable] in town, and they have some
kind of ceremony where we have to -- the -- the survivors have to go up on the stage, and they
have to turn on a candle. And they don’t say who they are -- we are, but we are the survivors, and
so I was called by the Jewish Center to take part.
Q: Are you pleased that there is so much publicity about the Holocaust now that -- that there are
more programs on television, that there’s more written about it than when you first came?
A: Yes.
Q: You are.
A: What upsets me now is that there are people who still don’t believe.
Q: Mm. How do you think this experience has affected you?
A: It’s going to affect me?
Q: No. How has it?
A: That I was very angry, cause it was the -- the minister of one of the western provinces who
said -- he was Dutch -- it never happened. An-And -- and he s -- he was -- made anti-Semitic
speeches, but when he said it never happened, I was thinking, what can I do about that? Yeah, I
didn't like that.
Q: When -- when you think about your life now, and you think about what it was like for you in
the Netherlands because of the war, and because you were in hiding, do you think that changed
you very much?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you think it affected you a great deal?
A: Yes.

Q: And -- and how -- how would you explain what it did to you? Do -- do you know?
A: Well, I knew that Tante Toos’s brother-in-law said, get rid of them. And I just figured if -- if
we would make trouble, and -- and make things difficult for Tante Toos in some way, like my
mom did at times, we would be thrown out on the street.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And that feeling has been with me all the time. I don’t want to antagonize people because I’m
afraid they’1l throw me out on the street.
Q: So you don’t want to fight, you don’t want to argue.
A: No. And -- and -- and my kids are the opposite, all three. They say what -- what they think. I
don’t.
Q: Still you -- you still don’t.
A: Actu -- I say what I think, but if it’s going to make friction, I don’t.
Q: You don’t.
A: No. And like I said, I don’t like border inspection.
Q: Right.
A: Stuff like that. And I also horde. Once in awhile Windsor cannot sell a product and slowly it
will go off the shelves. And when I notice that, and it is something that I’m using, I horde.
Q: So what are you hoarding now?
A: 1 -- [have a couple of pieces of Caress soap. They took that off the Windsor market, but I

A: [still have about five big pieces.
Q: Uh-huh. Okay.
A: That should go me awhile.
Q: Do you think that the -- do you think that the war harmed you?
A: Yes.
Q: How?
A: You know how isolated I felt, and now, afterward, I’m -- I’m just very shy. I’m not
aggressive, I’m not self assertive at all because for one, I -- I don’t bump and rock the boat. And
for another, I want the other person to show me first, how -- what they mean, are they really
friendly, or are they just putting it on?
Q: And for you that -- you think that comes from the war, not from before?
A: Yeah, I think so.
Q: Mmn-hm.
A: I think so because Hitler made it so obvious that there are Jews who did everything wrong.
And before the war, to me, the Jews weren’t any different from anybody else.
Q: Right.
A: [had Jewish friends and I had Christian friends, and there were -- well, first my mom of
course, would -- I didn’t accept it from her really, but then when Hitler came, you couldn’t help
it any more.

see more of his personality aspect before you make a judgment. That’s what I want to say.

so glad that you were able to come to Washington and --
