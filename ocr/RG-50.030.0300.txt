LISA NUSSBAUM DERMAN
November 30, 1994

01:00:15
Question: Why don't you tell me your full name and your name when you were born, and when
and where you were born and then a little about your childhood?
Answer: My name is Lisa Nussbaum Derman. I was born in Raczki Poland in 1926. I was one
of three children. I had an older sister Pola and a baby brother Busiek. My parents Herschel and
Gittel Nussbaum and an Aunt Sarah that lived with us. I lived in a very small town. We were
approximately five kilometers from the German border in East Russia, Ostpreussen!. And this is
where I grew up until the war broke out. It was a town with not that many Jewish families, 50
Jewish families, surrounded maybe by a 1,000 or 1,500 Christians. I grew up in a loving home, a
beautiful Jewish home that instilled in all three of us children wonderful values that really kept
me through the years and through this entire traumatic experience. I went to public school as a
child, and then I also went to a Hebrew school, and when there were not enough Jewish children
for a school, my parents had a private tutor in the house, a Hebrew tutor for myself and my little
brother. My father was an exporter. He exported geese and lumber to Germany and he was sort
of involved within the German world, so to say. When Hitler came to power, my father's
business at Raczki came to a stop. He was not allowed to trade any more, and conditions had
changed. We lived very close to the border and we knew really, what went on in Nazi Germany
by this time. However, we were not so much yet affected by it. The town I grew up in was
antisemitic. We suffered from Antisemitism. Even though, I have to really tell, that my parents
were sort of a very special family in this town. My mother especially was giving of herself to
absolutely everybody, Christians especially. They would come to her to write letters to America
because not that many people were educated and literate in the town. And by the very same
token they suffered from Antisemitism. When my father's business came to — abruptly to an end,
my mother too had a business. My mother had a fabric store, a large fabric store and there were
sermons in church given very often to say not to buy from Jews, and especially even mentioned
my mother's name — my mother's name was Gittel but in Polish they call it Gitka (ph) —
especially to mention not to buy by Gitka. Shortly after — right after Kristallnacht there was
already an influx of German Jewish refugees that came to Poland.
01:04:04
None of them came to my town because we were too small of a Jewish community to
accommodate Jews, but however, we heard from them about all the stories. Also, I wanted to be
very much aware, even though I lived in this tiny little town, there are people in America call
there a shtetl of the kind people think maybe from the Fiddler on the Roof. No, it was not. It
was not because we were quite really advanced in a way. We had a radio in the house. We hada
telephone in the house and my father in his days when he conducted business traveled very far —
traveled to Germany and to other places, and we really knew what went on in the world but very
little, because my parents have done at the time to change what was coming? The war broke out
' East Prussia

in 1939 and Poland was divided between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany, and my town,
of course, was directly on the German border. And immediately the Germans came and
occupied the town. I was not in town when the Germans came to occupy. My mother sent my
little brother and myself to my aunt that was only 15 kilometers away. I don't really know what
was the reasoning and such, and low and behold, when they bombed the town, my little brother
and I had the measles and we were in a shelter hiding from the bombs. And not even — we both
had such high fever that we didn't even know what went on. The town was occupied and
simultaneously, the Russians came and the two armies sort of met. And by rectifying borders my
town remained under the Nazi occupation and the rest, 21 kilometers away from my town
Augustéw was already the Soviet Union.
01:06:08
My parents had the foresight to leave with the Russians, because the Russians encouraged
anyone that wanted to leave with them were able to leave. We left. We took part of our
belongings, not everything but part of our belongings and we moved to Augustow, which was a
mining town 21 kilometers away. On there we were already refugees. We found
accommodations. I started to go to Russian school so that my sister — my sister already at the
time was in gymnasium and much higher grades than I was. My sister was 17 years old. And
very shortly after — I would not say that I myself as a child suffered much under Russian
occupation. My parents provided us with everything that they could. And now we went to
school. We made new friends, and youth has a way of adjusting very fast. However, my parents
had a much harder time, because my father being a businessman had a handicap under their — the
Communist regime. And we had to move away a 100 kilometers from the Russian border. And
we moved away from Augustéw and we moved away to Slonim, a town which was Poland after
1939, but then in the division of Poland and the Soviet Union — the Nazi Germany and Soviet
Union, ended up under the Russians. We lived on the outskirts of town, the whole family. And
my aunt that lived with us, Aunt Sarah. We lived on the outskirts of town in Slonim on the river
—on the Shchara, and our neighbors were Christians. Predominantly, Slonim really was a Jewish
town. It was a magnificent Jewish town because it had so many learning places, so many
synagogues, Yeshivot” — the famous Yeshiva of Slonim, the rabbis of Slonim, two Jewish high
schools. Really, a place that really did not lack of anything one would want to know or really to
enjoy in a cultural way as a Jewish child. I had friends, Jewish friends and Christian friends, too.
and shortly the war broke out between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and it is there that I
really met up with the Nazis.
01:08:57
We lived on the outskirts of town. The town was not bombed much, and we were not at all
affected by the war per se from bombs. Very shortly after the war broke out on the 21st of June,
very shortly after, there were announcements that Jews were not allowed to live in certain
quarters, in certain parts of Slonim and we had to move right away. We moved closer in to the
town, and it is there where really the first of 1,500 men were selected and taken on this market
place, and 1,200 men were sent to their deaths, very shortly, as soon as the Nazis occupied the
town. It was done by Einsatzgruppen. I am sure we did not by that time — the name. We called
? Plural of Yeshiva

them the chapones? in Yiddish. Chapen* means to grab someone, because they literally came;
they grabbed men, regardless. Whoever looked to them — they’re of a certain age, young sort of
— grabbed them and killed them. My family — my father and my little brother were not affected.
They were hiding in a outhouse outside in the house where we really lived. But they did not
come even to this part of town. Very shortly there was a law, we had to move again. It was still
before the real ghetto was established. We moved again and again, we had to vacate the place
because that too was a spot — it was really the center of town, quite prestigious, sort of to say,
and we had to move again. And we moved to Podgorna, which was the name of the street. And
it is there where we moved that already the ghetto was, even though a little bit larger yet than
what it ended up at the end. But it was already surrounded by — loose, loosely what they call —
they prided themselves — loosely barbed wires.
01:11:34
And it is there that I witnessed while we lived, still the whole family intact, that I witnessed a
massacre. The Germans called it an Aktion°, an action. What it means is really slaughter. And I
will tell what happened to me on this day. My father did not work as an artisan, as men that had
skills. He was a businessman so he only went on slave labor, and he wasn't, quote unquote, "one
of these desirable Jews" for a while that did certain, like the shoemakers that sewed their boots or
that made their uniforms and such, that for a while yet they need them. On Thursday a sort of
strange army came to town, and because the ghetto was so loose yet and you could see the roads
on the outside, trucks have been seen and Germans and soldiers — not only the ones that we knew
that are Germans, that are the Einsatzgruppen and the chapones, but also auxiliary forces that
served the Nazis. There came armies in black uniforms with sort of sleeves and with certain
insignias on their sleeves that were Ukrainians. There were Latvians that served Nazis — not all,
but in great number Estonians some. And the panic started in the ghetto. What are all these
armies invading coming to do in this town? And on the very same day on Thursday, some
people returned from work and they received a — it was called, the German called it a schein®. It
means really, a passport, a tiny little card, an I.D. card that had the person's name and number
and the stamp from the Gebietskommissar’ which would be the equivalent to the governor. And
a panic started. Only very few very, quote unquote, "desirable people" received it. The rest of
us didn't have it. My family didn't have it.
01:14:14
And my mother, before we went to the ghetto, first spoke to our Christian neighbor, that if there
is trouble in the ghetto she wants to send her girls to her. Would she take her girls if there was
trouble? And the woman said, “Yes, send them to me.” When Mother had first visualized that
there was danger, she really wanted to save her girls. In a haste we were dressed. She took us to
the barbed wires and, you know, it was loosely yet. They were not charged with any high

voltage electricity and any thing of that sort. Mother took us to the barbed wires. It was
November 13" of 1941. I was not quite 15 years old. My sister and I took off our yellow stars.
Mother lifted the barbed wires. We snuck out. There were always guard around the barbed
wires. All of us already had to wear marking. In Slonim the first marking we wore was a round
yellow patch, a round patch in the front of the garment and in the back of the garment, and we
took it off naturally. Mother lifted the barbed wires. She stood inside in the ghetto of the barbed
wires. We stood on the outside. I turned my head back, and that was the last time I saw my
mother because my mother was killed on this November 14". My sister and I — it was already
getting dark. I also want to say that other people tried to sneak out of the ghetto. A lot of people
tried to do it and many a times people were shot in the process. I guess you needed some luck
too, sometimes not to be shot while you tried to sneak out of the ghetto.
01:16:25
It was already quite — getting dusk, almost dark. We walked very confidently. I knew to keep
my head up so nobody would pay attention of two girls walking with their heads down — try to
identifying them — that maybe they're Jewish and such, because there was a lot of animosity
outside. We walked. We came to the woman's house. Nobody saw us walking in the house. In
fact, we made it a point not to walk into the house with nobody noticing us. We came. She let
us in and she kept us. She told us to go in the basement to stay overnight. We did. Friday
morning on November 14" there was a knock on the door and a neighbor came to tell her that
they are killing all the Jews in the ghetto, and the woman became frightened and would not keep
us as much we begged her. We cried. We just begged her to hide us somewhere — to tell her that
she is no danger — that no one saw us come into this house. And also, a Jewish man had a much
harder time surviving because only Jewish men were circumcised in Europe, Christians were not.
So this was right away identification that this is a Jew — was a male — was circumcised. The
woman would not keep us as much as we begged her. I have to tell you that it was already cold.
It was winter. There was already some snow on the ground, and she told us to go hide into the
woods, which we were really on the outskirts, not far away — not really far away. We had no
alternative. Nothing. What could we have done, two young girls? We went to hide in the
woods.
01:18:22
We came into the forest and we stayed for a while. And all of a sudden there were bullets flying
all over — flying over our heads, and we ran deeper into the forest to hide from the bullets. And
as we came in deeper to the forest we came to the scene of the massacre. It is in this forest that
on this Friday, 10,000 Jews were killed in open pits. Shot. Of course, we ran from the scene —
the blood, the screams. We ran in opposite direction hoping that we will survive this massacre.
As we were sitting there, both of us frightened, shaking, a ranger came in the forest. He wanted
to know what we were doing in the forest and we told him that we came to collect some wood
for the winter. At first he believed us and he let us stay. He came from the road. He had with
him — he came with a bicycle from the road — he had a rifle slung on his shoulder and an axe
behind his belt. We were in the forest staying and he walked in deeper. He heard all this
shooting. He became curious. He walked in deeper and he saw the scene of the massacre. And
he came with a rage to us — that that we are Jewish — we told him a lie. “You must be shot like

the rest of the Jews.” Nothing had we done to the man. Nothing. He was in no danger. The
viciousness of men. But he didn't take us to the pits. He took us to the road. And as he took us
to the road — leading us under the rifle — and told us to meet up with the group of the Jews that
were being led to be killed. The women and children were being walked, walked quietly,
holding on to their children — some carrying them. They were surrounded tightly with guards.
By running out they would be shot immediately. Men were in trucks with machine guns in the
back, and as we walked on the little walker’s path, the ranger behind us, at one point my sister
turned her head and she realized that he is a distance from us.
01:21:14
We ran from the scene to hide in the opposite side of the forest away from the shooting and the
screams. And all of a sudden as we were sitting there — both of us frightened, hoping that we
will live through the day — all of a sudden a ranger came into the forest. He came from the road.
He carried — he came with a bicycle — holding on to a bicycle, a rifle slung over his shoulder and
an axe behind his belt. He wanted to know what we were doing in the forest and we told him
that we came to collect the wood for the winter. He believed us and he let us stay. He too, came
deeper into the forest and he heard all of the shooting. And he saw the scene of the massacre.
He came with a tremendous rage — that we are Jewish and away from the pits. We have to be
killed like the rest of the Jews. The viciousness of man! Nothing have we done to him. Why not
find the kindness to save two young girls. He was in no danger of anything. But he did not take
us to the pits where they where they were killing the people. He took us to the road. He led us
under the rifle to the road where the group of women and the children in a great number were
being led to be killed. They were surrounded by guards tightly. Women holding on to their
children, some carrying them, walking very quietly. And the men on the trucks and the trucks
moving very slowly. In the back a machine gun attached to the truck. They couldn't run, they
couldn't do anything to change. Nothing at all could they have done. We walked on a little
walker’s path that was bumpy, a lot of ice, thin ice. As we are putting our feet — walking, it was
hard for even to pull for us to get our shoes out. And when my sister turned her head back and
she noticed that the ranger is a distance from us, she grabbed my hand and she told me, “Run,
run in the field and run in a zigzag!” And the two of us ran wildly in the field in all different
directions. Of course, the ranger in his rage threw the axe in the field. Then he began to shoot at
us. As he threw the axe in the field it hit the back of my sister's leg. She had a deep cut. We had
to stop in the field. We had scarves. We took off our scarves. We tied her leg and we ran in the
field all the way back to the community that we started from.
01:24:24
And it is for you to know that no one would let us come into their homes. No one would let us
come into their home. Desperately, we were walking, hoping that we can find a place to hide, a
place to hide. We were practically on the outskirts of town and there were no more homes left.
All of a sudden, we passed by a house and the gate to the house was open, and there was a barn
in the back of the house and the door to the barn was open, and we ran to hide in the barn. And
to the side of the house all of a sudden the door opened, and there was a little window in the
door, and a woman opened the door and, of course, we thought she would tell us — turn us away.
And this woman with her hands clasped said to us these words; “You do not have to tell me

where you're coming from. I know. God brought you to the right house. I will save you.” A
saintly Christian woman opened up her house, took us in, attended to my sister's wound, gave us
food, opened up a sleeping sofa. They took out the inside of the sofa, put us both in, left enough
air for us to breathe and kept us there the day of the massacre.
01:26:02
Iam convinced I am alive today because someone cared. Someone followed their conscience.
Someone had a heart. Someone did what a human being is to do to the next one that is in kind of
trouble that my sister and I were. The woman said, ‘God, if it should happen to my girls, please
somebody, help them, too.” And in this house there was a father and two daughters. They were
exactly my sister's and my age, and while we were lying in the sofa, people, the neighbors came
and sat on the sofa, telling her, telling the woman that they are going to search the Christian
homes and they will punish the Christians that hide Jews, which is true, they did. They did. But
the woman never vacillated. The woman never told us to leave or anything. In fact, she told her
neighbor, “This is Nazi propaganda. Don't fall for it. It is impossible to search the homes. Don't
fall for it. It is not true.” And at no time at all did she tell us to leave, no time at all. When
evening came — was my sister's decision — they took us out of the sofa. And the neighbors — they
closed the doors and made sure nobody comes in. And it was my sister's decision. She was
naturally the older of the two, the wiser of the two. She said, “We must leave this house in case
they do search. These people were so good to us. Why endanger them?” The father of the house
took with him a blanket and a pillow and took us to a bombed out house. We didn't stay in the
bombed out house. As soon as it got dark —because we were afraid in case somebody would find
us. We were not so sure we would meet up with such good people.
01:28:21
These righteous Christians are almost like beacons in this darkness, pointing the fingers at others
that could have done something too. There were so few, not so many. It is our great fortune that
we met up with a saintly woman that never knew us, never got paid for it, did it out of the
goodness of her heart. Following her conscience and would expect others to do it, too. We came
to a farm house. We knocked on the window. They let us in. We told them that we are Jewish,
that we want to change our clothes with them. We'll give them our city clothes and we wanted to
change into — let us give them our farmer’s clothes. They gave us. They consented. We told
them that we will not endanger them, that we will stay in the barn overnight and early in the
morning we will leave. And they let us stay overnight in the barn. We stayed overnight in the
barn. Early in the morning before sun, we started out just walking in the woods. And we knew
of a woman, a farm woman that used to come during the Russian occupation to sell butter and
chickens and eggs to my mother, and she invited us many times. She said, before the Nazi
occupation, “Why don't you girls sometimes come and visit me? We have a beautiful lake and
it's nice and we want to really show them hospitality.” Do you know I remembered the woman's
village? And we decided that we would go to this woman.

However, it was such a distance in the winter so we stayed in the woods. We lived — we never
went to a farm to ask for food because we were afraid. We never knew what kind of people we
would meet up with. So we lived on the berry that we could find, the mushroom that we could
find and we finally made our journey to this woman's house. She took us in. She kept us there
for several days. I think two days if I recall, and she kept us hidden; she was very smart. She
kept us hidden and she was a very popular woman, a very popular farm house in town with
children. Evidently, they were wealthy so everybody in the farm, all the young people would
gather there. So she told the young people when they asked her, “Who are these two girls?” She
said, “Oh, I hire two maids to spin and to weave for the winter to make wool.” So, she kept us
there, and we begged her if the farmers go to town to Slonim, to see maybe somebody survive.
Maybe they didn't kill all the Jews. And she made it in such a way — she was very clever, very
clever — she made it in such a way that there was no suspicion that she's hiding two Jewish girls
or anything. And she told the farmer, “You know, I used to sell eggs and butter to some Jews. I
wonder if somebody still survived.” The man came back and he told her, “Yes, but they killed
10,000 Jews” — he heard — “but there are still Jews.” He saw them returning from a nightshift
from work. My sister and I immediately left the farm house and we walked back on foot, back to
the ghetto to see if somebody from the family survived.
01:32:22
We never asked for a ride because we were afraid. We would see farmers and such. We
wouldn't approach them. We would run into the woods to hide. You must also realize it was
winter. We couldn't live in the woods. The elements — nor did have we food, nor did we have
enough clothing in sub-zero weather, in cold. We made our way back to Slonim. We came back
to Slonim, and on the outskirts we saw a group of Jews returning from work. We joined them.
We sort of ran into their midst. We asked them if they knew our family. Nobody knew my
family because we were really refugees already in Slonim. These were most of the people were
natives. Nobody knew my family. We walked in with them to the ghetto. We were not counted.
We just walked in. They kept us in the middle because we didn't have any stars on us and we
came into that room where the six of us lived, and as I opened the door my mother was not there
to greet me. Sol knew. My mother was killed. My aunt was killed. My father and my little
brother survived. And talking about courage — I'm a parent now. I'm a grandparent already.
Imagine my mother taking two girls, sending them into the unknowns so they would live.
Imagine what went through her mind. My father and my little brother were hiding outside of the
ghetto. My mother remained. My aunt was sick and my mother would not leave my aunt. She
stayed with her. That doesn't mean were she outside of the ghetto my mother would have
survived, but at least her chances would be better. Both of their chances would be better.
01:34:35
They shrank the ghetto. They made it smaller and we moved in on the street Operowa. We
moved in. We had one room. There were two rooms, a very rundown place, but — however it
was a little brick house and it was close to the gate where the ghetto was. In one room the four
of us lived, a tiny little room. We had a bed, one bed where the three of us, the children slept and
Daddy slept on a little bed cot, sort of. Next door, the other room was a family, a young family,
newly married and a brother that lived with them and they were wonderful to us. Wonderful.

They did not have children of their own. They shared absolutely everything with us. The little
bit of extra food, the extra hot water to wash. They sort of thought that maybe, maybe one of us
will survive or something. I don't know. It wasn't told to us but I somehow had the feeling. And
my father went to a slave labor. I did not work in the ghetto. I was too young. In fact, my little
brother would run out of the ghetto. He was blond and really, his Polish was so very good, and
he did many, many times run out on the Christian side, come back, would bring some food. And
it is in this ghetto where we first moved in. In December of 1941 a young man came into the
house.
01:36:51
Next to our house was a wooden house, larger, with more rooms and naturally more people lived
there — crowded, one on top of the other. And there was a young man that I knew that I really
knew yet from the Russian occupation because he went to the same school that I did, but he was
older. He was in a higher grade — came in one evening and he brought with him a fellow that
was, I thought, so much older than I was, and he introduced me and he was a young man. He
said his name Aron Dereczynski. They called him Arkie and he kept on coming, and there was a
friendship that developed. He worked in the Verpflegungsamt®. Did he have a chance really to
have food? Do I really need to explain and to tell the value of food in the ghetto when there was
such hunger? When a slice of bread meant — when everyone aspired to have enough. And my
sister liked him right away. My father sort of — since my mother was killed, my aunt was killed,
my sister really sort of took the motherly part, even though she wasn't that all — she was so
wonderful to us, so caring. She was a student before the war and I never expected her to come in
and to this role, but how beautifully she did it. How kind and nice she was to us. She wasn't
really that much older than we were. And as a friendship developed, Aron would come. You
know, there was curfew. Nowhere could you have gone or do anything. And meanwhile,
terrible things were happening in the ghetto.
01:39:07
People were being killed. Not in mass but they would hang somebody for bringing in food.
They would kill somebody. They found a bottle of milk in his possession, and the ghetto was
tense at the killings. And then —I guess it's a human quality — people would sort of like relax
and it was almost like normalcy. I really don't know why they thought it was normalcy, but the
tragedy was a community tragedy. Everybody was in the same shoes. There was no family that
wasn't touched. Everybody lost someone and maybe it was at this particular time easier to share
the grief because everybody cried. Everybody was in the same position losing their loved ones.
And I developed a friendship with Aron. It was more than a friendship, really — more than a
friendship. It was “boy and girl,” even in this abnormal circumstances. As time went on in the
ghetto and it was quasi-quiet. The Judenrat? had problems all the time with the slave labor. The
Judenrat had problems with the terrible demands always being made on delivery. Deliver them
that much gold and that much silver and the valuables. Slave labor in great numbers also the
Judenrat also was faced. People did not want to go to work. They really — I'm talking about

Slonim — they try to cope with it as best as they could. And I — when I think back and I reflect
and a lot of really thinking, intellectualizing and such, we always must put the blame on the
enemy. They were forced to do it. When they did not do it, they were killed for it. How many
of us have the fiber really to say to a stand, to take death instead of doing what you are told to do.
There was no suicides in the ghetto. People did not have the means. They did not have the
poison to do it with, no guns, but yet there was a tremendous urge to live, to live, that
tremendous self-defense to live. People did everything that they could at the time, in their
power. Whatever they could was possible for them to do to survive and it was so hard to
survive. It was almost impossible to survive — almost impossible.
01:42:19
This is why so few people survived. And again, when a government, an organized government —
they have to have power, an army, the money, an unfriendly population that does not want to
help for most part except for the righteous, and there were not so many numbers. They can do it
to any people, not only to Jews. Time went on. Time went on and meanwhile, there was —
people began to think of survival. The young, some of the young were involved in joining
together in the underground. I was only not part of it. I was too young. We were refugees. I
guess an underground you really have to develop strong roots to be able to trust the group as a
unit together. I was too young and we were refugees and my sister was not part of the
underground. Neither did she know anyone that was because also it was so terribly secretive.
How would one know unless you were approached and asked and really become part of this
unit? People in the ghetto began to build hiding places. They called them malines!”. It was
probably a Jewish word for a hiding place. In every ghetto that we lived everybody called it a
maline, a hiding place. Where were these hiding places? People imagined every possible place
that they could build a place where they could hide, where they could hide. Is it in the yard, in a
hovel dug out? Is it under the floor? Is it in an attic? Is it some place in a shack, or is it even in
the room concealed with a big credenza or something? People didn't have already, this. The
furniture was taken away because periodically there were the men from the Gestapo for
furniture. So everything that had any value of any was taken out of the ghetto. But people have
these old armoires yet, broken up yet. So some people built hiding places beneath, concealed it
with an armoire or with something of that sort — anything imaginable that people could think.
They did everything humanly possible to find a place to hide, because it sort of taught to the
people — the first massacre — were people to hide even under the bed. When we came in back
from the massacre, my sister and I, how much I cried and screamed. “Why didn't mother hide?
Why didn't mother hide?” Little did I know that maybe it was impossible for her to hide.
01:45:55
But I was a child. I needed my mother. And time went out. Everybody in the ghetto had a place
to hide. Everybody in the ghetto had a place to hide. In fact, between the two homes where we
lived, we had a hiding place for 30 people — for everybody there to hide. It wasn't anything so
very intricate. It was under the floor. And all of a sudden on a Sunday there were already signs
that something is going to happen. In between when Aron used to come to the house — all the
time, you know, he was such a wonderful spirit. He was so confident and he would tell me

things. That he belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir!!. I, in my town, did not belong to a Zionist
organization. There were not enough really children for a group — for a Zionist group — but I
knew about it. I read about it and I knew very well, because in the town in Suwalki where my
sister went to gymnasium there were Zionists’ organizations. And my cousins belonged to the
Zionists’ groups, so this was not strange to me. But he always — and he told me that just before
the war he was supposed to go to agricultural school in Palestine and it didn't work out for him.
But one day, one day, maybe he still will get there.
01:47:48
And I would listen to him and it would give me confidence. I sort of looked so much forward to
his visits — to his visits. And he always also knew a little bit of news, because in the
Verpflegungsamt, out by the Germans where he worked — this was the Wehrmacht”, the army,
the German army that he worked for in this huge, huge depository of food. They would
sometimes listen to the radio to German radio, so they approximately knew where the Front was.
And then they even had, he said, they even have a clandestine radio, which was to me like
something like a fairy tale thing. And our friendship grew. Our friendship grew and we really
became a boy and a girlfriend. By this time June rolled around, and all of a sudden, all of a
sudden on a Sunday, a strange army rolled around the ghetto. The ghetto by that time was sealed
—was closed with barbed wires. There was not loose at all — the gate and the people counted.
Always guards around the perimeter of the ghetto, much smaller after the first massacre. They
shrank the ghetto, made it much smaller and the congestion was much more. And a terrible
panic in the ghetto. What could these people have done? Very, very little. Only to hide — keep
them there. There weren't as many Christians that would accept Jews to hide, keep them there.
With an exception, I say again, of the righteous. The idea was to hide and to try and see maybe
we will survive by hiding. By Sunday night the panic grew and Monday morning, early in the
morning, we heard shots. We lived very close to the gate. We lived on the Operowa and the
gate was on a Operowa and I learned later that it was the head of the Judenrat, Gershon Kwint
that came in when this Einsatzgruppen group, and this army of killers came in to the gate to
march into the ghetto.
01:50:49
He asked them, “What are you doing with my people?” He was shot and this is the shots that we
heard because we were close to the gate. We were already by this time in hiding and the rest of
the ghetto was hidden. The ghetto was hidden and we separated with my sister. The place for
us, all of our neighbor, the two neighboring homes to hide was in the middle — was under the
sidewalk. And my father walked in to see at this place and he said there were children and also
he said the children might start to cry, and he felt that he couldn't breathe. He said, “I don't have
enough air there to breathe. I will not go there. I'll choke to death. We will not go.” My sister
ran across the street to find out the house, which was by the name of the Jachwidowicz house
across the street from us. Well, she was never able to return because the massacre — because the
Aktion started. My father, my little brother and I remained in the house and my father, the three
of us, tried to hide in the house. Where were we hidden? The kitchen had an old-fashioned oven

where before — for baking bread. To the side it was a deep oven. To the side was a little opening
for three people just to squeeze in where wood was kept in normal times. In normal times wood
was kept. Of course, we didn't have any wood in the ghetto. The kitchen was wallpapered and it
was really shreds sort of hanging. When they used to come to take people on slave labor, my
father used to hide in this spot. How did he hide there? He had a piece of cardboard that he held
almost, held from the inside that matched the rest of the wallpaper in the kitchen, torn the same
way as the rest to conceal this entrance into this little place next to the oven. And my father said
the three of us run and hide there. Monday morning when we heard the shooting already in the
house, we ran in to hide behind this oven in this little space that was open. They came in. The
killers came in to the house. They searched the house. They knocked on the walls. They never
came to this spot. “Raus, raus, raus!!*” And then we heard cries and we heard shooting and we
realized that the people next door were discovered. We remained in this place, frozen. There
was no place to move. For one of us to make a turn — all three of us had to move to be able for
one of us to make a turn. My little brother was a child. It was so hard on him. It was very hard
on all three of us. We stayed there the day. We survived the day.
01:54:26
At night my father said that we cannot stay there. It's not safe. We'll be found there. We must
hide somewhere else. We did not hide any more in this place. It was open because we couldn't
cover it. It was all open. The part that covered this entrance was broken. So we went in the
yard. There were shacks on the side and as we went out of the house in the shacks, we realized
that the ghetto is burning while we stayed in the house. We didn't know, hidden in the house.
We didn't smell anything. We didn't know. All of a sudden we went in, in the yard and we saw
that the ghetto is burning. But we had no alternative, so we went to the last shack. There were a
row of shacks. The last shack we walked in and we saw that there was a ladder and there was a
trapdoor, and we crawled up the ladder and we opened up the trapdoor. There was a loft that
hardly you could squeeze in and we found two old Jewish men, the old Mr. Margolis(ph) and
Mr. Fink(ph). And we asked them, “What, what — where are all the rest of the people?” They
said they did not hide in with the rest of the people, because they knew they couldn't breathe
there. They were coughing and they didn't want to endanger the other people, so they did not
hide with the rest of the family. They were hidden in this shack and we came to this shack. We
walked up and threw the ladder away so it wouldn't be a sign that some people are hiding in the
shack there on top in the loft and we stayed there. We stayed there. We didn't have any food at
all. Daddy went at night and he brought water. He found he could not find any bread in the
house. Nothing was in the house. He brought water so we still had water, and we stayed there
Monday night, Tuesday and Wednesday and we watched the fire, the ghetto burning.
01:56:58
I do not know how it was possible that this shack did not catch on fire. I do not know but it
didn't. And we survived in this shack. And while we were lying in the shack, my father said,
“What even if we survive? All the Jews are killed. What are we going to do even if we survive?
What am I going to do with my two children? Where are we going to go?” But we didn't. We
stayed. We stayed in the shack hoping for a miracle. On Thursday afternoon we heard noise in

the front and we — all of a sudden we heard steps in the back and somebody calling in Yiddish.
“Lisa, Lisa,” and, “Jews, if anybody's hiding, answer, answer.” I couldn't believe it. I could not
believe it, that this was possible, and I wiggle my father. “That sounds like Aron, that sounds
like his voice.” My little brother opened the trap and I answered, I answered. Aron came into the
shack. My little brother opened the trap and he leaned over and he said, “Yes, the three of us are
here. We survived the fire and we're still here.” So Aron said that the massacre — they are still
purging people but it is already much quieter and it looks like they will leave some people. They
will let some people live, survive. So all of a sudden a ray of hope sort of came in and then Aron
tells me, “Go down. Climb down from the loft, from the shack.” I jumped down. He took me—

Tape Number Two
Q: Why don't we start with hearing the voices calling in Yiddish.
A: As we were sitting there, it was in the afternoon. In fact, I'm sure it was in the afternoon. All
of a sudden we heard footsteps. Of course, we froze. We thought that it's Germans again
coming to find us. All of a sudden there were voices in Yiddish — in Jewish and I heard, “Lisa,
Lisa.” At first I couldn't believe it and then I also heard in Yiddish saying “Jews, Yidden, Jews!
If anybody is hiding, please answer, please answer.” And I nudged my little brother and I said,
“Daddy,” I said, “it sounds like Aron. Could it be?” And I answered and as I answered, Aron
walked into the shack. My little brother opened up the latch and, of course, can you imagine the
kind of feeling that went through me? My wildest dream would I ever imagine that I am ever
going to see Aron again? And here he came really to the rescue like. He looked at me. By this
time we were sitting there already three or four days without food, only with water, being so
cramped in that there was no room to turn. And it was a very hard on my little brother. He was
so restless and every time he had to move all of us had to turn. I jumped down. Aron took me to
the house, to the empty house. Of course, all the houses were empty. The people were gone
already by this time.
02:03:22
He took me upstairs to an attic and he looked around for a while. He looked for some clothes
and he came in and he brought with him a boy's jacket and a pair of pants. Women in Europe at
the time, this particular time, never wore pants, and he found a scissor and he stood there. And I
was in shock, in complete shock and he said to me that he's going to dress me like a boy because
women are not allowed to live. He found the scissor and he cut my hair completely. He left a
little stubs on my head and I did everything that he told me to do. He put on a cap on me and as I
walked down, there was a mirror and I took a look. I took off the cap and I took a look at
myself. I was frightened to see what I look like without — shaven, not shaven but practically
shaven — without hair. But I followed him and I walked out. We came to the street and four
Jewish men were waiting there. They were the men that Aron worked with and already he had
enough time to tell me that he has kept Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt that he works
for, asked him to come into the ghetto and to find some valuables — I don’t know - riches, riches
to enrich himself on this tragedy. And he said — Aron said, “It was my idea because I wanted to
come to the ghetto to see if I can still find someone alive. And maybe he has had an opportunity
to take you out with me.” He told me that his mother and his three sisters are alive, that he left
them in the hiding place because he says he could not take four people out. And he says, “I
could not even decide; who would I take out of the four?” They put in — they were carrying, — all
the men had on them it looked like chandeliers, really nothing fancy to speak about. Maybe it
was old something with some wires. They took off— one man gave me a chandelier sort of — I
don't know, you call it a chandelier — something that resembles a chandelier, and he put it over
my shoulder and he put some wires around my neck, and we walked out. All of us walked out.
We came to the gate and the guard was at the gate and Aron very confidently — all of us carried
something. Some of the men carried something in pillowcases. I didn't even know what they
carried there. I learned later that all of it was for Miller, and all of us walked out.

Aron waved confidently his slip of paper that Miller gave him to come into the ghetto. They
came in into the ghetto with Fritz which was one of the Wehrmacht, regular soldiers that worked
in the Verpflegungsamt and he waited for them. Across the way from the ghetto directly across
was the house where the men that the German Wehrmacht that ran this Verpflegungsamt lived
there. It was Captain Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt and Bauer also a captain and one
more, a German, and two regular German men. So I was absolutely numb. I didn't really know
except to follow and to do what I was told to do. Aron took me into the German's house. I could
not believe why he would do it, but he didn't take me to the upstairs. He took me to the
basement. He left me in the basement within a pile of old furniture that was lying there and I hid
behind the furniture. All of a sudden a young Jewish boy came down and he searched for me.
And he said to me, “Don't be frightened, don't worry. I will help you. I will do everything that
needs to be done for you,” he said. And the first thing what he did is he brought me food. He
brought me food. And when I looked at him, he was a child. He looked to me like he was not
older than 12 or 13 years old. And he said, “Don't worry, I'll take care of you.” And he did. He
did everything what he could. He said to me, “There are maids working here, but I will not let
them go in the basement. Everything that they need, I will run and get it so that they won't come
down in the basement to find you.” And he did. But all of a sudden as I was sitting there hidden,
Bauer walked in. I didn't know anything about Bauer. Can you imagine how frightened I was?
Here was a German came in and he found me. I was sure he was going to shoot me right there
on the spot, but behind him was Aron. And Bauer tells me, “Stand up.” And I stood up. I stood
up and he said, “Do you have girl’s clothes?” And I said “Yes, underneath I have girl’s clothes.”
Because I still had the clothes that I went into hiding. And he said — then the little boy ran down,
the Jewish boy, and he brought me a babushka. He said, “Take off your Boise’s clothes. Put on
this babushka and come with me. I'll take you to the Verpflegungsamt.” And he walked — we
walked out. I learned later that Aron asked Miller — he said, “I'm hiding — I brought here my
sister. Please do something for her to save her.” And Miller pounded on the table saying, “My
place is no place to hide Jews. Take her out of here immediately.” So then Aron approached
Bauer, evidently while the ghetto was burning, and when Bauer passed by and saw the shooting
and the killing...he was a decent human being and that he was terribly upset. And he said, “How
could I believe it that my people can do something like this?” And so Aron approached Bauer.
02:10:31
He had no alternative. He had to take me out of this German house. He approached Bauer and
Bauer walked with me. Do you know the house where they lived was across the street from the
school, the high school that I went to before the invasion? It was recess and the children were
walking out of school during recess and I thought to myself, “Why am I so cursed? My parents
were such good people. I am equal to all of these children. Why is it done to me? What have I
done? Then this befell me. What have I done? They are free and here I am being taken to the
unknown, maybe to death for nothing that I have done.” I always thought the Jews were good
people. All the people that I knew were Jewish were good. I am sure there some maybe that
were not so good, but maybe I didn't know them as a child. I walked with Bauer. He told me to
walk on the sidewalk. I did not have my yellow stars. I walked with him. We came to the
Verpflegungsamt and there already the man that worked the Verpflegungsamt waited for me to

come and to hide me somewhere. They made a hiding place for me. The hiding place was; they
took out two sacks or three sacks and they covered it. They found a piece of plywood, put a
piece of plywood — put a sack to cover the plywood or two sacks to cover the plywood and
marked it because it was a huge warehouse, with hundreds and hundreds of sacks of flour, of
corn, of oats, of everything. It really supplied the entire area around Slonim — that there rations
were given out to the Germans, to the Pole, to everybody from this warehouse. They marked it
in such a way so that they would know where I was hidden. They made just enough space in this
little tiny place where they took out the several sacks for me to crawl in and to lie there, and they
left enough space of air to come in so I could breathe and I stayed there. I stayed there.
02:13:06
When night came everybody left, and I remained all by myself in this warehouse, hidden. And
as I said, I remained in the warehouse. All of a sudden I was being scratched by rats, lying there.
And I was afraid that I was going to be devoured by them, that they will scratch me, eat me
practically. And with all my might that I possessed, I pushed the sacks back and I crawled out of
this space. And all night long I was sitting on top and running away from the rats. Then when
morning came and I knew that they were going to open up the warehouse, I was afraid for them
to find me. Maybe the Germans would come before the Jews would come into this warehouse. I
crawled in again and I was able, not very well, but to cover myself again, pulling that sack to
cover as I entered. It wasn't very well concealed but enough not to notice. And anyway, if the
Germans didn’t know that I was hidden some place where they would go and check thousands of
sacks of flour to find me. The next day they already allowed for people to live. They allowed
for people to live. The people that still remained hidden were told to go out from the hiding
place. They took them all to the jail, the people, and they started there the selection left and
right, who to live and who to die. To the left and to the right and to the left and to the right. I
was not there but I learned about it from my father and my little brother, because my father and
my little brother still remained hidden. And then they heard that there was a reprieve and you
can really go out. They came out and were told that they were going to be given a Schein, this
certificate to live — this I.D. card to live. But they were taken to the jail first and there they
would be given the certificate. And there they started the selection and somehow, somehow my
father was given the card, was sent to the right side to live and my little brother remained on the
other side, and he ran and he tried to beg this Nazi, to beg him that he wants to be with his father.
He wants his father and I guess in his, with all of his viciousness and with all of his thoughts of
inhumanity, he found really a trace of caring. He threw my little brother. He grabbed him and
he threw him to my father, and he survived. He was let out of the jail with my father.
02:16:40
And I knew about it because one of the men came to the Verpflegungsamt and told me, “I saw
your father and I saw your little brother and they were alive, and they survived the selection in
the jail and they are alive.” And here they said that women already can live, too. Women already
can live, too. I did not stay in the Verpflegungsamt. They put us up in the Beutelager'*. It was a
really a huge army barracks that were built for the Polish Army way before the war, and there
they collected all the surplus of broken up, damaged arms from the war, Russian arms that they

collected. And this is really where the young Jews that were involved in the underground work
were able to steal the arms and to smuggle them in piece by piece into the ghetto. Or in some
way, Germans that were — some of them that were bartering with Jews even brought it in under
boxes of soap, hidden under soap that was brought in into the ghetto. Approximately, not more
maybe between 800, 900 maybe 1,000 people remained from the entire ghetto, from 20,000
people. And they left a little small little ghetto, besides the people that lived in the Beutelager.
The Beutelager where were all the young people that still worked in the Beutelager or the
Verpflegungsamt, and every day, every morning there was an appell!°, we had to go out to be
counted. They would come in the middle of the night with lights, have us all come out and to be
counted. The people that lived on the last ghetto, the several homes around the river on the street
that's called Mostawa were given an identification, a little tiny piece made out of clay with a
number that you had to wear around your neck all the time — all the time besides your round
badge. I stayed at the time in the Beutelager, and my father and my little brother stayed on
Mostawa. I used to go — I too had this badge that I wore and you were allowed to go from the
Beutelager to Mostawa. Already my father was thinking that we must leave this ghetto, we must
run away from here. And my father evidently went out of the ghetto and found a farmer, a
woman, a farm woman that he still had some means to pay her with. I really do not know what
he gave this farm woman. I don't remember what daddy still had but he still had some valuables.
I know because he still had it in Wilno — the ghetto that he managed to hide. And this woman,
we traveled by horse and buggy. We went out of the ghetto. We were not caught of course,
otherwise I wouldn't be here to tell you the story. And we were hidden under a big wagon with
hay. We were under the hay until we came out of the outskirts of Slonim. Then she told us that
we can be in the open. Neither of us looked Jewish. My little brother was blond with blue eyes.
He was almost a towhead. I was blond with blue eyes and my father did not look Jewish either.
No, he didn't. So, she really relaxed and told us we can even be on the open and we came in.
We came into a village to a farm house and we were hidden. We were hidden, and while we
were hidden Partisans came into the village and my little brother begged, “Daddy, let's go with
the Partisans.” But my father said to him, “My child, I am too old. They won't take me. They
won't take you either. You are a child and your sister is a girl. You entertaining an idea that is
just a dream. They won't take us. We must continue to another ghetto.” We came to Volkovysk.
We came to the Judenrat.
02:22:08
We told them that we want to go to Grodno. The whole idea of Grodno —because Grodno was
still annexed to the Third Reich, and the killings in 1942 in the summer of '42 they were unheard
of in the Third Reich. And we somehow heard by way of people coming — I don't know really —
Daddy heard that they are not killing people in — the Third Reich. The Jews are still going to
work in the Third Reich and maybe they are not going to kill the people in — the Jews in the
Third Reich. In the beginning Daddy thought so. Then we finally came to Volkovysk and we
got passage and we came to Grodno. We came to Grodno to a world that already for us did not
exist — already since occupation. Everybody was killed in pits. And here the ghetto was quasi —
sort of free —the first ghetto, the second ghetto — the working ghetto — the ghetto that people did
not work. You were able to walk from one ghetto to another. In fact, my mother had a cousin
that lived in Grodno. She was in the second ghetto with a husband and wife and two children

that my brother and I adored. And as soon as we came we ran. We found out that they lived in
the second ghetto. We ran to them to see the family, to tell them about our misfortune, that my
mother was killed. My sister was killed. I didn't mention really that my sister was killed in the
second Aktion. In June of 1942 they found the place where she was hiding. They took all the
people out and my sister knew what to expect, and she ran to the barbed wires to run out on the
Christian side and she was shot on the barbed wires. I lost my wonderful sister, the one I loved
so much. We shared with them our misfortune, telling them what happened. And we lived. We
came back to the first ghetto. We came back to the first ghetto. I had — my mother had another
cousin in this ghetto but they did not have enough food for us. They lived in — they had one bed
for three people; husband, wife and a child. We were assigned a room. We came to the
Judenrat. We told them that we are survivors of Slonim, that everybody was killed. They sort of
took it, almost, they didn't believe it. And when my father used to retell it and we retold, they
say, “Enough already. Enough already.” And you know we were sort of convinced that this
would happen here too. We were convinced and we tried to — Daddy especially, tried to do
something.
02:25:39
To do what he can do with the children to survive but what could he have done? He was
considered an old man. My father was in his early 50's, not quite 50, I think. And we were
assigned a room in the ghetto with a family. There were two rooms. Three families in two
rooms. In one room there lived a family — Lipszyc. Herschel Lipszyc with his father that was
very orthodox, and a cousin of his, that her family was already killed in a small town. They
drove in all the Jews from a small town in a barn and they set the barn on fire. She was visiting
grandparents in another place and she escaped. So she lived with them. In the next room lived a
family with two children and they assigned us to live in this room. We had a bed. That was the
extent of the living that we had in this house in Grodno in the ghetto. And shortly after we came
to the ghetto, all of a sudden, one day Aron showed up. Aron showed up. I parted with him
thinking I will never see him again. I left with my father and my little brother and he — all ofa
sudden Aron showed up and he told me — we discussed. In fact, when we left I told him that my
father knows of a farm woman that would take us. He said that he knows somebody, a neighbor
of theirs that he was very, very good friends with told him of a woman that is going to take them
and then he'll give me the names so he can come too — run away with his mother and three
sisters. And then he told me in tears that he parted with them in Volkovysk, because he said,
“By staying together we only perish together.” He said, “If I want to have any hopes of survival
it is only in the underground — the woods, and if I will stay with my mother and my sisters, all of
us will perish. So I decided to run away to come to Grodno.” And in Grodno we lived with the
Lipszyces, and Herschel Lipszyc was wonderful. He would sing. He would bring a little bit of
respite and life. It was not terrible hunger at the time yet. No, it wasn't.
02:28:35
I couldn't believe it, that something like this still existed under Nazi occupation. And Aron went
to slave labor with Herschel. My father did not go to slave labor outside of the ghetto. He
worked in the ghetto, but my little brother would run out all the time, back and forth. He really
had a tremendous courage and sense of adventure, running out all the time. And it is in this

ghetto while Herschel Lipszyc took Aron on slave labor to remodel a house for the Gestapo that
Aron befriended a Pole. His name was Tadek, they called him, but his real name really was
Tadeusz Soroka. Tadeusz Soroka came very often to barter with them. He would bring them
food and they in turn would take out — they would wear an extra pair of pants and extra jacket on
them and trade for food. He was a good friend of Herschel Lipszyc. Herschel knew him much
longer than Aron. And all of a sudden, all of a sudden November first rolled around and they
sealed the ghetto. They sealed the ghetto and transports started to resettle it, to resettle people in
the East supposedly. And rumor started in the ghetto where are they resettling the people. No
one at the time thought of gassing people. No one at the time thought of Auschwitz, Treblinka,
Majdanek — merely fear of resettlement. You were told to take a certain amount of clothes, to
take your toothbrush, to take all your necessary things that you would need to go and to be
resettled. And you will even get better rations and better food. People tended to believe it
because they thought maybe they'll be better. By this time already there was more hunger in the
ghetto and anyway, the Jewish — the Judenrat was forced to make a list of so many people for
resettling.
02:31:17
And it was a sign of resettling much more so only the ghetto because they start to bring all the
Jews from the small towns from around Grodno. And Grodno had really hundreds of small little
towns and villages where Jews lived, surrounded with small towns and little villages where Jews
lived. They took them all in and brought them into a detention camp in Kelbasin and from there
the people from Kelbasin were sent first to Auschwitz and to Treblinka and Majdanek, beknown
to them where they were going, beknown to them, lists were being made and transports. They
finished with Kelbasin and they started with the ghetto. Naturally, we were outsiders. We were
not natives and we were always the first people on the lists. But to our advantage was our past.
By being in Slonim and being in the ghetto and surviving two kinds of massacre and surviving
practically — sole survivors in a ghetto of thousands, of close to 20,000 people. Out of 20,000
people, eight — 900 people survived. We really realized that we have to do everything that we
already learned and the first thing is hiding. And we started to make places to hide and decided
that we would just hide. We would not come with a suitcase to be taken to go to Auschwitz.
Aron helps people find — build hiding places. They knew that he came from Slonim and he
knows, and the word traveled. It spread by word of mouth. So here he knew of a lot of places
that he helped to build. So when we knew that we were on the lists, we began to hide. And we
would come to one place and try to hide and all of a sudden, “No, this is not safe. No, no, no, we
must leave the place right away. It's not safe.” We went to another place and we didn't stay — to
a third place — I remember one night we changed five places. It was — we were going crazy from
fear not to be caught while running out from one place to the other, four people, the three of us
and Aron. We survived this transport.
02:34:06
After we survived this transport again it was sort of quite for a while. Respite came to the
ghetto. And Herschel Lipszyc with a very dear friend — oh, my God, I forgot his name — Lutek.
Lutek were approached by Tadek and he told them that, “You know, you don't look Jewish. I
know of a Polish family or a Lithuanian family in Wilno that will keep you as Christians. I will

take you to Wilno.” And Herschel consented to go with Tadek and Lutek to Wilno. What were
the alternatives? Another transport? If you have a chance you do it and it is for really to know
that people tried to do it. They took every possible chance. The chances were so few, so few.
You needed the looks. You had to look Aryan to be able to survive on the Christian side. You
had to meet the right people what would keep you. You have to think about years, it's not days.
This is why the righteous that saved, that kept Jews, some of them for years, are really people
that are an exception in this society. They're giants. They are giants. They are to emulate — a
whole world must learn to emulate. They were the people with morals with consciousness and
they wanted to help and to do — do not kill. Do not kill. Be your brother's keeper. Aron —
Herschel parted with his father and his niece and his cousin. Aron went with him to the barbed
wires. By this time already Aron knew Tadek, and the idea was when Herschel and Lutek will
arrive to Wilno that they will send back a note with Tadek to tell everyone that they had arrived
safely. Well, they arrived safely but they did not send the note, and Aron didn't know about it.
So he was reluctant to believe Tadek. Tadek gave him the kind of story that either you want to
believe it or not. He said he took them to the Polish family. They were afraid to keep them
because even though Lutek, his Polish was perfect, but he had Semitic looks, which is true by the
way. It was true. And the family was afraid to keep them. So he said, “I took them to the
ghetto, to the perimeter of the ghetto.” He says, “I show them where the ghetto is and they
walked into the ghetto. They told me that they would come and give me a note to give back to
Aron.” Says, “It poured, it rained. I waited and waited for the note and they never showed up.
Here I come to tell you that they are in the ghetto but I don't have a note.” Well, Aron already
had hesitations, “Should I believe him or should I believe him?” But he left it. Tadek kept on
coming and kept on coming and bartering and the ghetto was not quiet any more. There were
talks about transport and people already expected this transport, and already they begin to loom
that these people are not going to be resettled. That there is some thought, “They’re sending
them some place, to concentration camps. And do you know what they do to most of them?
That they gas them. Gas them in 20th century? It must be. How could it be? How could it be?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it can be, it can be.” And it already begin to work on people and people
already begin to believe. But so little could they have done to avoid the transport. So little could
they have done to avoid the transport. One day Tadek came and tells Aron at work, “Aron, the
ghetto is sealed. They are taking out the ghetto — the Jews.” We escaped the first transport of
5,000. “They are taking the Jews to resettlement and I doubt if you will have a chance to
survive. Come with me to Wilno. I'll take you. I'll take you today. Come with me. Don't go
back to the ghetto.” Well, Aron listen to Tadek and he said, “What should I do? I have nobody
in the world left. I left a mother and three sisters in Bialystok — on the way to Bialystok. The
only person,” he says, “that I really have ties to is Lisa. Should I leave her too and go to Wilno,
to go to the unknown?” By this time already he almost has said he resigned. He said, “What is
life altogether? What ifI survive? I have no one. All the one — all my dear ones are gone. They
are killed. What is —I still — I think I'll go back to the ghetto.” And by this time already the
people that he worked with sort of were suspicious that he might go away with this Christian,
and they worried because they were counted. And this too — was a tragedy that we are
responsible one for another. If 10 people walked out of the ghetto, 10 had to return. If nine
returned, they took hostages and they killed people. And you had this tremendous responsibility
of the whole community, and it's not only said that they would take hostage. They did take
hostages and they killed people. They killed people. They came to a house and they didn't find a
person. They found this woman outside of the ghetto in Grodno. They dragged her into the

ghetto and they took out the people, the person in the room that she lived with. And both of
them were hanging on the gallows for days for the Jews to see what's being done when they
catch Jews outside of the ghetto and if they're not reported that they are missing. So there was a
communal responsibility. You were responsible not only for yourself but for others.
02:41:09
That too kept a lot of people from maybe running away or doing something. Families clung
together and they perished together. Tadek came and told Aron that he — the ghetto is
surrounded. He better go with him, as I said. But Aron decided to go into the ghetto. He came
into the ghetto. He was immediately arrested, taken into the Synagogue, and he looked for me.
He didn't find me, because when this came — that the transport that are coming to grab people
again, my father, my little brother and I went to hide again. We really did not have a very good
place to hide. So in our yard where we were living was a courtyard. Again, there were shacks
where before the war people kept wood. And again, my father and my little brother and I
crawled up in a little shack, in a wooden shack and we stayed there. Police came and knocked,
“Your number is up. Come out. Come out. Anybody hiding come out.” Of course, we froze.
We didn't answer. The Germans came in and knocked and searched around. They did not come
with sniffing dogs. Were they come to sniffing dogs though, they would probably would find us.
And we remained there. Aron searched for me in the Synagogue, in the Synagogue. He didn't
find me in the Synagogue so he didn't know — either I was killed or hiding or whatever had
happened to me. The massacre — the transport went on for quite a few days and finally, it came
to astop. A handful, about 800 maybe, people survived, maybe close to a 1,000 people, and as
we were sitting — you see the shack where we were sitting faced the Synagogue and we saw all
the thousands of people being led to the trains, being led, this march, this endless march of
people being taken to the trains, to Auschwitz, Treblinka and Majdanek. We — all of a sudden
we saw Jews running and carrying a little bundle and we realized — and they were talking loud
and we could hear. We realized that it's over and, you know, the talk was — evidently — people
that wanted for other people that were hiding, to know that it's safe to come out. So in Yiddish
they would say, “Come out. Come out. It's safe, it's safe. Git aroys, Yidden.'° Git aroys, git
aroys.'!’ Come out, come out.” When we heard this, my father said, “It's safe to come out.”
And we came out. We were practically numb for lying like this all curled up. We came down
and we came and we realized that the house where we lived in — it was a two story, it was a
building really. There were two buildings together — that people were running to these buildings.
So we realized evidently that these are the buildings they left for the Jews. Yes, it was. There
were three buildings that were left and one of the buildings was our building, where we lived
before. So we went upstairs and as I came in upstairs, I found Aron there. I could not believe
that it could be true. I could not believe. For sure I thought that he is already taken in a transport
and I never, ever see him again.
02:45:20
He came with another man, that he told me the story how he was saved when this man let him
build a hiding place under the coal. And that now we have to do something very fast, to run

away from here and our only salvation is Tadek, that we must get in touch with Tadek and run
out of here. Well, my little brother went out and made — Aron had the address. He was always
ahead in his thinking so he knew where Tadek lived and the address. And my little brother went
out to meet Tadek, and Tadek told him that he would take him and my father to Wilno. He
would take them on freight cars that are traveling between Grodno and Wilno and he would let
them — if they arrived safely, hoping that they would arrive safely, he would bring them into the
gates of the ghetto. Let them walk into the ghetto. And it was a designated day that my little
brother and my father left the ghetto to go and to meet Tadek. They came to Tadek and Tadek
said that on that day he could not take them. That he would take them the next day, that there
was no transport going. So they went to hide. They were hiding in the second ghetto that was
completely empty overnight.
02:47:00
And the next day they met Tadek as he told my little brother where he would be and they would
travel to Wilno. Tadek again told them to stay in a ditch — to stay in a ditch that was right next to
the yard to the railroad yard, and then when the train begins to move a little bit to jump on and to
try to crawl on to the roof. Well, my father listened and when it was time to run out, he did. He
did as he was told, but he would not step on to the two couplers and try to go up to the top of the
roof, and he said, “Even if I have to be caught and killed, I cannot go to the top of the roof. I
cannot do it.” So they were hidden on a flat car that had a tank that was traveling to the front —
German tanks that were going to the Russian front and covered with tarps, so they were hidden
under the tarps and they somehow made it. They somehow made it. They were searched. They
searched — there were stations where the trains — the flat cars were being searched to see if there
was anybody. By this time already there were Partisans. There was already danger of Partisans.
But they didn't find them. They arrived to Wilno. They got in into the ghetto. They found
Herschel and Lutek in the ghetto and my daddy send a note with Tadek to Aron to tell that he
found Lutek in the ghetto and Herschel and that Tadek is for real and to come to Wilno. And
then it was our turn to go to Wilno. I went out of the ghetto. By this time the ghetto was very
small and guarded, and I went out of the ghetto to establish a contact with Tadek. I came — I
found him and he told us to come on a designated day, on a Sunday and then he would take us. I
came back to the ghetto and I told Aron that I met Tadek. He consented to take us and we'll go
out to meet Tadek. But not only Aron and I, but we were eight or nine people. One of the
people that we met was Elkie Jezerski, that knew — he said that he knows of a janitor that used to
be a janitor in their building where he lived, and maybe we can hide there and wait until Tadek
can take us.
02:50:11
Eight people went out, not with the idea of all of us to go but maybe Tadek would take them
one-by-one. Meanwhile, they would establish a contact and they know Tadek and they will stay
with this janitor. Elkie had a feeling that the janitor is fine and he would keep us. All of us came
to the janitor's house, and at midnight the janitor decided that he does not want to keep that many
Jews. It is dangerous. We must leave his house. He said, “But I'll keep the girl.” He wanted us
to leave right away and it was curfew so we begged him. We begged him to let us stay until it
gets a little in the morning before sunrise, while it is still dark. And he kept — he let us stay and

all of us went out of this house. He took us — the janitor took us to a bombed-out house. I went
with them with the idea that I can stay in the janitor's house. I stayed in the janitor's house. I
met Tadek at church. Tadek told me that he would take us on a Tuesday. Here it was Sunday. I
came back to the janitor's house and the janitor sent out his wife and the children, and I was not
thinking at all, not knowing. I was a child yet. He wanted to rape me or to kill me because he
was sharpening knives. I had the presence when I heard knives being sharpened, that even
though I was locked in a room — I was locked in a room when he sent out his wife and two girls,
[had the presence to run out. I ran from the house, and in my chase running out of the house, the
doors were flimsy even though the door was closed and with a latch, but I went out with all my
strength. And I slammed the door in such a way that by the time he opened the door, I was
already a distance from him, from the janitor, and my luck was that there were stairs. It's hilly.
It was very — it was hilly and there were stairs and there were homes on the sides of the stairs.
He ran to chase me. I was faster than he and when he came about the middle like, of the stairs
and where there were homes, he was afraid because they shouldn't tell that he's chasing a girl or
maybe it's a Jewish girl or something, so he left.
02:53:21
I ran to the house where the rest of the Jews — Aron and the others were hidden — to tell them
what happened. That we cannot leave tonight. That Tadek will take us Tuesday and that the
janitor, either he wanted to kill me — I did not realize that he wanted to rape me — that he wanted
to kill me. And I ran away, and what are we going to do? We decided that we have to return to
the ghetto. We cannot stay there until Tuesday, until Tadek would meet us. We had to return to
the ghetto because there was an empty yard and children were playing ball. It was a bombed out
house and the windows were open and we were about to fall in into this basement, into this hovel
where we were all of us hiding. The children would run home and say, “The Jews are hiding
there, so many of them.” We were afraid that they would give us out. We had to wait until night
came and we went back to the ghetto. We could not remain one day of the danger that loomed
outside. We came in back to the ghetto and Tuesday as Tadek told us to meet him — told me — to
meet him in the public washroom at seven o'clock at night in the evening, and he would take us —
when he said would take us, he only meant Aron and myself but five people went out — not, not
two. One of them was Ruby Loren, the man that Aron was saved in the synagogue, his cousin,
and another young man. And the reason the five went out, because we wanted the other people
to have this contact to be able to go with Tadek another time — to know him and where he lives
and so forth — to establish a contact. Five of us came. It was dark. We came to the public
washroom. Dark, seven o'clock. Tadek was there.
02:55:43
He told me that he would be dressed in a uniform like a railroad worker. He would have a
flashlight. He would light the flashlight so I would know that that was the man. Exactly there,
seven o'clock, the men were in a public washroom in the middle of Grodno on the Christian side,
naturally. I waited for Tadek. Tadek came and I tell Tadek that we are five people. When they
were hidden in the public washroom, they looked out of a little window and when Aron saw that
Tadek is there, he went out to talk to Tadek and he begged Tadek to take another person. He tell
them that, “I was saved with this man. I really don't want to part with him. He was good to me.

I want to be good to him. I want to take him with me.” But Ruby didn't want to go because he
tells Aron, “The only person in the world is left is my cousin. I don't want to leave my cousin. I
want to be with him. I have no one left in the world. Everybody in my family is gone already.”
Aron tells him, “Look, Ruby . They will come Thursday. Tadek promised to take them
Thursday. You have an opportunity. Come. They will come. You'll be in the ghetto already.
Come.” And Ruby was standing there sort of halfway with his cousin, halfway, when Aron
grabbed his hand and took him with and he went with us. The others returned to the ghetto.
They never were able to make the trip because for them, death came. Resettlement came before
they were able to go out of the ghetto and to meet Tadek again.
02:57:21
I walked with Tadek. Aron and Ruby followed. They were both very Semitic looking. They
wore Polish looking hats called maciejwka'®, a kind of hats that Poles wear. We were not
stopped. We came to the railroad station. Tadek pointed out to us the train, the freight train that
was going to Wilno — from Grodno to Wilno. Within the freight train, also there were passenger
cars that the Wehrmacht — that the Germans traveled. But we were to travel — Tadek told us that
when the train began to move already at a little speed to jump out, to try and grab, to run up
between two boxcars and the couplers and find a little ladder and try to crawl up to the top of the
roof. I listened and I had it all in my mind to do it the way Tadek said. Aron went out first and
he was able to do it and went up to the top of the roof, I learned later, and Ruby, I guess, did the
same. I remained in the ditch, or lying in the road, I remained in the ditch. I turned my head and
I saw so few cars left. “Oh, I will remain. It's the end. It's the end. I survived until now but I
won't survive anymore more.” I ran out and I have not been able to find the two box cars with
the couplers, but I saw a boxcar with a door and, you know, it had a handle, a little ledge, and I
grabbed on and I stood on the ledge. I held on to the handle. I have not been able to go on to the
top of the roof, and there I was standing with my feet, wearing mittens in sub-zero weather,
holding on. The train began to accelerate, add speed. I was already frozen. The wind tore off
my babushka and I couldn't hold on much longer. I couldn't and I couldn't do anything. By this
time already I wish to be killed so it would be over with. And all of a sudden I heard a noise on
top. I heard a noise and it sounded like somebody is sort of on top. And then it got quiet and I
still was holding on. I learned later that Tadek came to find his passengers on top. He found
Ruby and he found Aron lying on one roof on the same boxcar. He didn't find me. He asked,
“Where is the girl?” They said they don't know. They still left her in the ditch and they don't
know what happened to the girl. Tadek did not give up. As the train was moving and moving
very fast already, he jumped from one boxcar to another until he came almost to the end of the
train, the almost of the end, and he saw me standing there holding on yet. He ran for the car
where Aron and Ruby were on. The three of them jumped boxcar after boxcar. Youth was with
them. They were young. They were able to do it. My father could not do it and a lot, a lot, a lot,
of people could not do. Children and woman could not do it either. You had to be young to be
able to do it and to know that there was a Tadeusz Soroka. This were not that many Tadeusz
Soroka. They came to the boxcar that I was still standing and Tadek leaned over, gave me a
hand and told me to hold on to his hand, that they will pull me up. I had a vision that he will
grab my mitten and not my hand. And I said “I must do everything that I possess not to lose his
hand.” And I managed. The three of them pulled me up to the top of the train on the roof and I

Tape Number Three
Q: Now, you're just about to arrive in Wilno. So tell me what happens then and how you end up
in the Resistance?
A: We arrived in Wilno and we were able to go in into the ghetto without any problem. Tadek
walked with us. He told us to cover our faces with soot so we would look like railroad workers
coming from work or something, and he said, “As soon as you see a group of Jews returning
from the nightshift, from work, try to jump in, in their midst and walk into the ghetto.” And we
walked with Tadek for awhile and all of a sudden we see a group of Jews. Of course, worker
Jews because they walked in the street, not on the sidewalk and they all had yellow stars. We
went into their midst and we walked in into the ghetto. This was the last time on this voyage that
we saw Tadek. We came in into the ghetto and Jewish police immediately took us over. And as
the Jewish police took us over they took us into Dessler!® and to Gens” in order for us to receive
rations, a piece of bread that everybody needed and a bow! of soup and also, a place where to put
your head down. I'm not talking about a room, but a place, a piece of floor to put your head
down. You had to be registered within the Judenrat. Dessler cautioned us not to tell anyone. Of
course, we told him the story, that we are — about the transports and we still had a story to tell
him about Slonim and then Grodno about the transports. Also, he said, “You have to be very
quiet, not to tell people, not to put the ghetto in a panic. Not to put the ghetto in a panic. Here
it's different. Here it's different, and don't jeopardize your ration cards and do as we tell you to
do.” Needless to tell you, neither of us listened to what he had to say. We spoke our mind and
told people exactly what happened in Slonim, what happened in Grodno, and by this time
already people in Wilno knew too, because it was already after Ponar and a lot of killings in
Wilno but the situation there was still different. The ghetto was still vital. There was still quite a
large ghetto. Icame in. I was immediately — I was told where my father and my little brother
are and I immediately ran there to be with them. Can you imagine the joy of my father to have
me come to Wilno?
03:07:01
Now, Aron immediately found a group of people that came from Grodno. They were together
with me. There were nine men and a girl. I was the only girl. So they all lived together and they
were called in the ghetto “The Grodno Group.” They all sort of were dressed the same and they
were called “the Grodno Group” and they all lived ina room. They had one room with another
married — with a couple and the couple's sister. So you can imagine how many people in one, in
one room lived. The ghetto — people went out to work and there was a lot of cultural activity in
the ghetto that came to me as a total surprise. There was a library where you could go and take
out books or sit and study. There were children playing ball. There were competition and there
was a theater in the ghetto. I couldn't believe it, that this was possible. There was a restaurant in
the ghetto. This was such an unknown experience to me that I felt like it was a different world.
My father worked outside of the ghetto. So did my little brother — used to go out and I too, for
the first time went out to work outside of the ghetto. I worked in hothouses where they raised
vegetables for the Germans. For —I guess for the German elite, whoever, the Gestapo, or
'® Saulk Dessler, head of the Vilnius ghetto’s Jewish police.
?° Jacob Gens, head of the Vilnius ghetto’s Judenrat.

whoever. The leader there was a — the foreman there was a Lithuanian man and he knew some
of the Jews that worked there, so he wasn't very harsh on us. And the Germans didn't watch us.
We somehow could always, always finagle a little bit, where we could steal a radish or a carrot
and eat it real fast and try to get rid of the green part of it. And it is there where I worked.
03:09:26
The man that was our foreman, the Jewish foreman, always used to go away and leave us. I was
very, at times, angry. I say, “Why does he do it? Why does he do it?” Little did I know. Much
later in the underground where I met him that he was part of the Jewish resistance. But I didn't
know when I worked with him. The man never told us or anything. He evidently was trying to
do something for the resistance on the outside of the ghetto. So I worked — Aron worked inside
of the ghetto and very much our hope was only the resistance and the underground. We knew
that we can not survive in the ghetto. And because it was still a large ghetto in numbers and
there was still quite a young people in the ghetto, we tried to look every possible way to get in
touch with the resistance. Do you know, before the war was known for this — it was called “the
Wilno Jerusalem of Lithuanian.” There was such a strong nucleus, culture in Jewish and in
every, every aspect of Jewish life in Wilno that we were convinced that there must be an
underground there. And when Aron worked with one of the men in the shop in the ghetto he
realized that he's — that they do something there. That it's always producing a part, a part, a part
and the minute the foreman, the German foreman, would walk in they would immediately hide.
He learned later that they were making some parts for armaments in this shop, that they were
really working for the Germans. And besides Aron there was another man that had contacts in
Wilno and from both sides, somehow, they contacted the Jewish resistance and the resistance
took us in because they were all young men, unattached with no families, and we became part of
the resistance.
03:11:43
It was very, very secretive. I could not tell my father, neither I could tell my little brother. And
then the story of Wittenberg”! developed in the ghetto where a Communist, a Polish Communist
was caught on the outside of the ghetto and within his torture he gave out Wittenberg as the
leader of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto. Now, the Judenrat played both ends of the picture.
They were with the resistors and they were with the Gestapo. Gens had a notion because in 1943
when we came to Wilno in March, then April, May, June, the Germans had big defeats on the
Russian Front already and Gens had a thought that if the resistors do not bring in the destruction
of the ghetto, the people might survive. Maybe liberation will come and everybody will be
liberated, not only the couple of hundred young people, resistors. So he wanted to convince the
resistance to “don't rock the boat.” And even though he knew there was resistance, so he played
both ends. But he convinced the population of the ghetto that, “the resistors will bring down
your end.” And the population of the ghetto was with Gens, unfortunately, not with the resistors.
And then this tremendous play with Wittenberg developed and as we know from history now
from the Wilno ghetto that Wittenberg was turned over to the Gestapo. He committed suicide
and Abba Kovner” took over the leadership, but at a time when the leadership decided not to

give out Wittenberg. They called us to come in the barricades and to fight, to raise a fight with
the Germans. Of course it was futile. We all would have been killed. And when we came to
this designated place I realized the strength that the resistors had because they were so big in
numbers. They really did not have much to fight with in arms. Of course not. It's a David and
Goliath fight. I mean there was an army with tanks, with all the supplies in the world, and we
only had our bodies, a few grenades and something that we wanted to give our lives — to show
the Jews fought back, that we fought back, that we achieved at least something.
03:14:36
And as history tells, Wittenberg and I tell, Wittenberg was given — there was a big discussion
among the leadership. We learned all of it later after it was over. We were not in the leadership
position. I was a 16-year-old girl doing what I was told to do and really being so grateful that I
was part of the resistance and did absolutely everything that I was told to do, and I knew very
little except what I was told to do.
03:15:14
Q: This time when you all came together, tell me more about when and where that was.
A: That was in Wilno in the ghetto that faced the outside of the ghetto, and it was at midnight
like, late at night. From all sides group start to converge to this place, and as we came it was
dark. Maybe there weren't as many numbers, but I conceived it as a tremendous number, two —
300 young people that came there and some of them were walking. Some of them had a grenade
and somebody had a pistol. And we already, our group, too already possessed couple of pistols
that we really bought on the outside of the ghettos, smuggled it in and paid with hunger by not
eating, by not having that slice of bread to be able to obtain the pistol. It was an exhilarating
experience to be there, even though that we knew that we would all die, because we were no
match, we were no match. All of a sudden we were sent home, to go back home. We didn't
know the drama at the time until the next day when it developed that Wittenberg decided that —
they came to him with the thought and told him what it entails. And Gens told the leadership,
the resistance leadership, that if he doesn't give himself up, they are going to come and destroy
the ghetto. And there was a lot of people, Jews, running in the ghetto screaming “Wittenberg,
Wittenberg,” for him to give up. “He's bringing the end to us. He's bringing the end to us.”
Little did they know that the end was coming anyway. But when I was in the ghetto, my
thoughts were altogether different. I was the enemy of these people that said for Wittenberg to
give up and to — not to rage and to fight, not to fight back because the ghetto will be destroyed. I
thought they would be destroyed anyway. The end will come anyway.
03:17:42
But for the ones in the ghetto that still had children, every day meant something and Gens kept
on saying, “If we live through this period, maybe we can still live through the liberation.” I
began to appreciate it many years later when I had a family and children. And I know that you
were to be responsible, not only for yourself but you're responsible for your family too. You
cannot run out. You can only do it when you are a youngster, leave your parents. You cannot do

it when you are a parent. There is much more responsibility expected of a parent. And then the
decision was, after the Wittenberg affair, of course, Wittenberg was taken into the Gestapo and
he was given poison and he committed suicide. So they really got nothing out of Wittenberg as
far as questioning him and for him to give out secrets or anything. And then the thought was that
we cannot wage a war — warfare — in the ghetto. The population is not with us, is not with us,
and the only solution would be to send the resistors into the underground in the woods in the
forest to fight from the forest. And little by little, groups began to leave. How did they go? It
was a 180 kilometers. The closest the Naroch woods where we went to. Groups of 25, 28 or so
were sent with guides. Who were the guides? The guides were Jewish Partisans already that
were in the underground and were already, so to say, “free people.” They took upon themselves
the risk of being killed to go into the ghetto and to lead groups of Jews out of the ghetto. What
courage! What heroism to do the kind of, really, thing that you risk with your life to do it. They
were giants, giants of men. Giants, lions, young dedicated, fearless, that came to the ghetto.
Some of them were even arrested in the ghetto and then let out. And they took groups. Some of
the groups that went out before us met up with an ambush and were killed.
03:20:30
Q: Why don't we actually start with, let's start with the resistance to take taking you with them
because you were a girl.
A: After we contacted the resistance, I really was not one of the people that contacted the
resistance, but it came from two different sides. Aron knew somebody and our friend — another
friend of ours that was from Grodno, that knew the resistance, knew somebody in the resistance
already, and finally we were able to join the resistance. When it came the time to really go to the
forest, there was a discussion that among the Grodno group there was a girl and they were not so
keen of taking the girl, to leave the girl behind. Little did they know that I could do everything
that these men were doing, even more, and I was really at no time at all any liability to anyone in
the underground — just the opposite. But Herschel Lipszyc, our dear friend Herschel Lipszyc,
stood up and he say — they call me Liska(ph) — “If Liska doesn't go, none of us are going. All of
us are going and Liska is going too, and this is the way it is going to be.” And because he was so
very positive and naturally, Aron very much wanted me to go, no question. I mean, I joined in
group because Aron was part of it. On my own, | don't think I could have reached the
underground. So finally they consented that they'll take me too. We would be going to the
underground to Naroch and we would go with a group of 28 people. So on a designated day
there came a call that it's time for us to leave for the underground. All the Grodno people, the 10
of them lived together, so the call came to them. And early in the morning, about three or four
o'clock in the morning, there was a knock on the little window. In Wilno we lived in a room
with three more families. There were practically corpses all over the floor, to walk out. It was
time for me to go to the underground.
03:23:15
I have not been able to walk out because I would wake up all the people that want to know,
“Where are you going in the middle of the night at four o'clock in the morning? You can't go to
work that early.” I slept in the bunk with my brother, and Aron knocked on the window and he

said, “It's time to go.” I have not been able to go through the door, so I had to slip out in the tiny
piece of the window, the little window that opened up for air. Luckily, I was so thin and so small
that I was able to get out. I have not been able to tell my father. Neither did I tell my brother. I
only told him, “When I am gone, tell daddy that I have left — that I left.” And he says daddy will
know where I went. So that my little brother was intelligent enough to know. Can you imagine?
I left without telling them because it was so secretive. I wasn't able to tell them. Were I to
remain, who knows if I would have survived and I wanted to go so much. The leaders were the
two men. It was Shlemke Hilczyk and Motke de Geller — Motke the Red. Really, I can only
speak about them in superlatives. Only super giants, men that were ready to give their lives to
help other Jews in need. They were already free people when they were in the underground. Of
course, they could have been killed but they were not in the ghetto. Their dream was already
accomplished. They were there. They were fighters. They came to take out groups of Jews
from the ghetto to lead them in into the underground. It took us seven nights to walk to the
underground. Twenty-eight people left. Among them were women too. I wasn't the only
woman. I was the youngest, that much I'll say. I was the youngest in the group.
03:25:26
The first night when we came out we went out of the ghetto as a group going to work. We came
to the outskirts of town. We were hidden in a little wooded area, hardly wooded enough not to
be seen. There were shepherds with the flock. We took them with us. We kept them the whole
day. We did not harm them. We blindfolded them and we kept them there, and when night
came, when we left this little forest, we let them go home. And we told them under no
circumstances are they to tell that they were in the woods with some Jews, because they will be
punished severely. We showed them that we had weapons, and we left. We walked with this
man that took us — that supposedly knew the road and they got lost. They had no compasses,
only by the sight. We tried to go with side roads, so we would not be seen and identified. But as
we were going on the side roads we only got lost. We got lost and we had to cross a railroad
track on the other side of the railroad tracks. So he decided to go on the main road where
Germans were traveling, and every time, he told us, we see approaching cars with lights to drop
in the ditches and to hide. And one by one we crossed the railroad tracks while German guards
were standing. Every time the guard would turn to the back towards us, one of us would slip out.
Twenty-eight people had to cross. Imagine the danger. And all of us crossed safely. Part of the
way when it began to get light we were running, not walking, but running to hide. The day we
hid in a little forest we started out walking again and we had problems again. The road wasn't so
clear to them. They came back from the forest. Somehow they knew their way but they had to —
maybe —had to change the way. They took another road and two nights in a row we were lost.
They never lost their cool. They always kept us convinced that they know what they're doing
and they will bring us in a safe place. And we had the total confidence, total confidence, in these
two young men. Finally, they decided after the second or the third day they decided to take
farmers to lead us, to be our leaders. And the farmers knew the way and we told them to bring
us to the next stop. They told them to bring us to the next stop, and the farmers listened. The
farmers listened and brought us to the next stop. They were cautioned not to give out the Jews,
that this is a pack of Jews. The farmers knew very well and somehow we made it.

We had to cross two rivers, and one river a farmer took us and we were all walking all the way
up to our waists. Some of them didn't know how to swim. They were worried that they would
drown. And we made it. The farmers said, “The river is not very deep. You will make it.” And
he was right, we made it. We came to cross the big river, the Viliya, and the Germans were
standing guard on the bridges, and when they heard the splashing of the water from so many
people walking. They began shooting at us. Fortunately, their aims were poor. Nobody was
killed and we crossed, and finally the two leaders start taking wagons with farmers, wagons, and
they put us up on the wagons. And we traveled on wagons already, until we came to what is
called “Partisan Territory” where there was a tremendous number, already, of Partisans and it
was safe. This was Partisan Territory so it was safe. And it is there, while we were on the
wagons traveling, all of a sudden we were stopped. We were stopped by a Jewish Partisan riding
on a horse with an automatic rifle. Can you imagine our joy? I will never forget this moment.
Never, never. Leibke Gordon on a horse with a rifle, with a machine gun, greeting us, falling all
over us, kissing us, we kissing them. He was like Messiah. We came to the Promised Land and
they brought us into the truck. The guides waiting for permission. They didn't know the
password. You had to know the password. They didn't know the password. They were stopped.
They told they are going to the ghetto to bring Jews to the Partisans, so they were let in and then
we were let into the base. We came to a place that it's — how could I describe this place.
03:30:58
It was like Robin Hood. There's people walking around with rifles. Sides of cows are hanging
that were being slaughtered for the food. Huts — we lived in huts that were built. It was hilly so
they were built in the hills made out of logs, dug out, you know, made out of logs. And there
were bunks. A long bunk that was not for twelve — how could I describe to you the scene as we
came down the hill. I seen a Robin Hood. People walking around with rifles, sides of beef
hanging, huts, people coming out of the huts milling great number of people. I never could have
believed that this is the way the underground, the resistors, worked. I thought they lived hidden
in some kind of a small little place away where nobody could ever find them or such. This
seemed to be so open. It seemed so open and we were welcomed right away. The leader — we
came to a Jewish unit that was called “Revenge” — ““Nekamah” in Hebrew — and the leader was
Joseph Glazman*’. He accepted us with warm arms and right away everybody wanted to know
who we saw, the last people that we saw in the ghetto. And we learned that it wasn't that simple
for Jews to be in the underground, in the Jewish unit. That the Russians would not give them
any arms, enough in the unit, and the thought was they met up — they told us they already met up
with Antisemitism and the Russian unit is separately, and they look down upon these Jews that
came from the ghetto. After all they are ghetto Jews. Little did they know that these ghetto Jews
knew how to fight and were better fighters at times than the others were too.
03:33:46
And very shortly, very shortly — the spirit was wonderful. It was sort of free. You felt free even
though you knew there were dangers, that there were Germans all the way around. But you felt
free and I kept on thinking, “If people in the ghettos would only know that something like this

existed, they would all run, they would all come.” But I knew very well that they couldn't run
and they couldn't come. It's only the select youth that were able to do it. I knew it but you
thought both ways. Very shortly, very shortly this Jewish unit was disbanned, was disbanned
under the pretext they are training the Soviet Union, all the nationalities mixed together. There
isn't such a thing as a Jewish unit — it must be integrated unit. And, of course, they sent away
most of the group to be in a family camp. Actually, it wasn't so much a family camp because
there were hardly — we did not have any children in this group. But also the artisans are people
that knew how to sew. They made them because this was the Jewish elite that came from Wilno,
the Jewish elite. They send them in to bake bread, for the woman to peel potatoes and to sew, to
make boots for the Partisans. I don't know — sew their uniforms. I really don't know and there
was a tremendous anger among the group. Tremendous. People felt so rejected. They felt it
was so unjust to do it. Here people came to fight and they were sent to be ina group. They gave
some of them weapons so they can defend themselves in case they are attacked and also to go out
to the farmers and get food — to get food. After a while there was no alternative. People got
adjusted, but they felt it was a tremendous injustice. All of us felt it was a tremendous injustice.
We remained in the unit and we were the first among the Russian units, in a lot of Russian units.
But our group, that were in this Jewish otriad™, remained with the Russian unit and it was called
the Kalininski Otriad and, of course, we met up with Antisemitism. With Antisemitism women
had a very special strike against them. Nobody thought, the leadership and even the soldiers, the
resistors, did not think that women know how to fight, know how to do — when you need to go
on a mission or something of this sort. And they told them, you know, to do kitchen work, to do
this and all sorts of menial jobs.
03:37:16
And some — then Glazman took a group of really the most outstanding young men and women
and they left. They were so really hurt that this could happen to a group that was so dedicated,
that was so knowledgeable, that had all the potential to do everything that was asked of resistors
to do, that they left. They left to go to the other groups that left Wilno and went to Rudniki to the
forests, to the “Pushcha”> Rudniski” it was called. In English they call it Rudniki. And on the
way they ended up, they met up with an ambush and they were all killed. One young woman
escaped and she came back and told us what happened. How they were killed and things and
exactly what happened to them. Very shortly after, we were dispersed within the groups. I was
always within the Russian unit with the Jews that were remained in the Kalininski Otriad and
whatever it was asked of us to do, we did. We did it very well. What do the Partisans do? They
really made it impossible for the German Army to move. We cut down trees and blockaded the
roads. We mined the entrances to where the resistors lived and this was called an otriad, the
units where they lived. They cut down telephone wires and they made ambushes at times;
dynamiting the roads, dynamiting also trains that went to the front. In the very same token, we
helped Jews that were hiding in the woods because there were Jewish, young children and also
elderly people, women that escaped, wanting a family that ran out of a ghetto that either burning
or everybody was being killed, and quite a few children. I mean not in large numbers, no. And
we saw — they lived at first almost like wild — running from place to place and hiding and never
having enough food. Some of them even died. But when we came into the forest, we made sure

that the farmers keep them and they watch over them for their safety because we threatened the
farmers. If something will happen to their safety, you will be punished and punished severely.
And you'd be surprised, they listened. Because they knew that we had power. There were sieges
every so often.
03:40:32
There was one tremendous siege in the fall, a little bit later in the fall in 1943, where the
Germans that were going to the front had to come through the woods, and we lost a lot. A lot, a
lot of Partisans were killed. A lot of them were killed. They systematically walked through. We
were hiding on an island that was covered. We thought was safe. It wasn't at all. After we came
out of there we realized that we could even be seen from the road. But somehow we survived,
but 20 — we survived but at least between 20 and 30 percent of the Partisans we lost in the siege
that were killed, that were lost. We returned back to the base. The base was not touched. They
never came to the base and nobody was on the base. Now, the leadership, the leadership took it
first a group of Jewish young men and I was left to guard, to stand guard for the leadership. And
after the danger really came that they realized that they cannot travel in a group with more than
two or three of them. They ran away hiding some place with farmers. They changed their
clothes. They were after all, they were Russians. They were Christians so they didn't have this
danger of being Jews and hiding among farmers. They left. They left, disbanned all of us, and
told us each and everyone to go and look out for ourselves and it will be over to come back to the
base. We came back to the base and we found, for a while, no one. After a while the leadership
came and they start dropping now leaders from behind the enemy lines to be our leaders, and we
begin to grow in numbers and everybody was armed because the arms were being dropped from
behind the enemy lines. We made an airport and air drone like where we cleared out part of a
forest. And at night on four corners of this meadow, we would light fires for the planes to
identify where to drop the shipment of arms. So Jews and no Jews, everybody got armed.
03:43:18
The others always were armed. It's just Jews, always the Jews. And time went on and at big
battles they would organize two or three or four units to come out together. At times we just
walked and walked for days not knowing what they were doing and what was going to be done.
But somehow we always came back to the base, and later we would learn that this was sort of an
exercise of a sort. Nobody questioned. Nobody questioned. We did what we were told to do.
Time went on and I have to tell you that one day as I was on the base, somebody came running to
me to tell me that my father came into the woods. I left my father and my little brother in Wilno.
When one of the groups went — guides went to Wilno I begged one of them, begged to tell my
father that I am alive and that I am in the Naroch woods. He told my father; he went to my
father. I told him the floor. I told him the house where we were, and my little brother was
caught in the street in Wilno while they were grabbing the people and was sent to a labor camp
in Estonia, and then added up in Stutthof concentration camp. My father was home and he
remained all alone, and when he learned that I was in the underground in Naroch, he walked all
by himself, dressed as a Pole. Luckily, he came to the underground. He lived in a hut that we
provided him. He and three, four more people that lived there. We provided food for them and
safety. They knew that they were safe as long as we are in the woods around them. And my

father lived there until liberation and he was liberated together with me. Liberation came. There
were battles. I did not participate in the battles because it was really the big units that it was
done, combing through the woods. We remained on the base and the last time before liberation
some of our closest friends were killed, while they were combing the woods, to put up, to catch
some of the Germans that were escaping from the front or something. And we lost quite a
number of men, and the men that we lost were our close friends. There were battles that the
Russian Army waged and summer of 1944 we were liberated.
03:47:04
We were liberated and we immediately — most of the men were drafted into the army, to the
Russian Army. We — my father and I and Aron asked for permission just to go to Slonim to see
somebody survived maybe from his family. He was granted the permission. In the Soviet Union
you couldn't travel as you wished. You needed a permit and you had to show the permit
everywhere you went. We were given the permit and we came to Slonim. I knew that I would
not find anybody in Slonim but we still had hoped. Daddy told me that my little brother was
caught on the street, that maybe he survived. Maybe he's alive somewhere. Maybe he wrote to
the house that we lived in Slonim. So we came to the house and the man of the house that we
lived in was killed by the Nazis because he was a Communist. The wife and the two children
survived. We left a lot of our belongings — when we went to the ghetto — was left there. We
were absolutely, penniless, without anything to change — anything to wear, only what we had on
our backs. And we asked to try and give us something that was left in the house that belonged to
us. The landlady, the woman of the house said, “Nothing at all is left and everything was taken
away.” The only thing she gave me is a slip, an embroidered slip of my mother's that I treasure
‘til this day. It was the only thing that I remained with, the hand-embroidered slip. We left
Slonim immediately. There were no Jews in Slonim. However, I found a note from a cousin of
mine that was saved deep in Russia, in Kazakstan, looking for us, if anybody survived from the
family. So I immediately was able to get in touch with my cousin Harold Brenner that lived, that
was still survived in deep in the Soviet Union. We left Slonim. We stayed in Baranovichi for a
short while. We were taken in by Jews that survived and all the survivors became like a family.
03:49:42
Everybody took in everybody. Everybody shared with a piece of bread. You were so happy that
somebody survived, because whoever survived thought that he was the only person that survived
— that everybody's killed. The joy that you found something. I came to Baranovichi and my
Hebrew teacher survived and he met us on the street. The joy of having Meyer Chalasnowicz
survive. He took us into his room. He shared his food with us. And as Poland was liberated, we
left the Soviet Union as Polish citizens. We were allowed to do it. Aron left first on New Year's
Day of 1945. My father and I followed right after, right after, and we came to Bialystok and in
Bialystok there was danger again of being killed, again, after the war by pogroms. They talked
about pogroms. They talked about killing. It didn't materialize in Bialystok but it was in other
places that we knew. And it is in Bialystok that we start searching a way how to get out. There
must be a way to get out and to get to the West. And Aron especially, we met in Bialystok. We
came right after and Aron had a room, a house, a room in a house and he took us in and we

stayed there and Herschel Lipszyc stayed there, and whoever survived from the Grodno guys
stayed with us and we were like family, like family. What I wanted to add that before we came
to Bialystok we went to Grodno. We went to Grodno to tell Tadek that we survived. When we
came to Grodno, my father, Aron and I — Herschel Lipszyc was already in Grodno — and
Herschel Lipszyc said, “Well, we came to Grodno.” We said, “We came really to tell Tadek that
we survived.” He said, “Yes, I already talked to him and he knows.” He says “imagine.” So we
made a party. A party, really a reunion. Tadek came. We kissed and we hugged and the men
drank. There were other people. He brought some vodka and there and the men drank, and there
were other people, the Jews that survived, that everybody really shared in our joy.
03:52:37
And everyone made a tremendous to do over Tadek, to tell him how much we appreciate what he
did, even though it was only one night in the chain of events. If it weren't for this night, who
knows if we would have survived. The same goes for the first woman that kept my sister and
myself in the couch. If it weren't for her, I don't know if I would survive. If 1 would be here to
tell you all this. Was only one day, and by Tadek it was only one night. What are the other
nights and the other years that it took to survive? Yet, without this chain, were the little link
broken, I probably would not maybe be here. You needed somebody to give you a helping hand.
The tragedy was there were not many helping hands, and the ones that helped, again, are the
giants in society. They had the moral fiber. They had the conscience, the feelings. They were
real people. The way I would expect people to do in case of need. And in general, to have
morality because were the Germans moral, this would not have happened. And it is in Bialystok
that we began to look a way to come out. And again, there were rumors that there is an
organization that came, people came from Palestine. They're trying to lead the survivors, get the
other survivors and see if they can takes them to Palestine. This was something sort of
unbelievable. How could it be possible? But you know, after a while we learn that it is true.
People told us by word of mouth and it wasn't that, really, secretive. It wasn't announced in the
opening, but neither was it secret because they were very anxious to help. And Aron through
Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, again contacted the B’richa”® and with the help of B’richa we start to
getting out, to getting out. We left Poland. My father remained behind for the simple reason that
he had still hopes to find my little brother.
03:55:05
He said, he will stay and see what he can humanly possible to see if he can find his little brother.
He said already, “I will manage to get to you later.” We came to — from Bialystok we came to
Lublin. In Lublin we met a greater number of young men and women that Aron knew that were
members of the Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir and that were friends of his and his sister's friends. And we
traveled with them. We were given passports as Greek Jews, and we began to travel from Lublin
to Krakow, from Krakow we went to Czechoslovakia to Bratislava, from Bratislava we went to
Hungary and where ever we went we met by the B’richa. They somehow arranged. There were
other trains. The entire European continent, people were traveling in en masse, going home,
going home. Everybody had a place to go, but the Jews. They were going home to Italy, to
Czechoslovakia, to Rumania. Everywhere people were traveling. The trains were full. You

grabbed on. People were hanging on the outside of the boxcars and in the passenger cars. There
were no tickets. People just traveled. The Red Cross announced, too that they had facilities,
whatever. We were given really passports by Red Cross as refugees, and we came to Graz.
From Hungary we came to Graz and in Graz we had to cross the river, and to cross to get to the
western zone of occupied Europe. We did it with the help of the B’richa. They led us. A group
before us when to go through to swim through the river. Some of them drowned and they
decided to hold off and to send the rest of the groups through the Alps. And we went through the
Alps with leaders that led us. And we came to Tarvisio. Tarvisio was already Italy. It is in
Tarvisio that we met up with the Jewish Brigade. The Jewish Brigade was part of a Palestinian
Jews that volunteered and they had a hard time to be accepted as a unit to the British Army. And
they were wearing these insignias here, the English insignias, but here on the sleeve they had a
Magen David — a Jewish star. Can you imagine from wearing the star in the ghetto to come to
Tarvisio and to see Palestinian Jews wearing it proudly on their sleeve? The transition that it
took in us. They were absolutely — they did everything humanly possible to do everything for us.
They fed us to the point where all of us were sick, because we were not accustomed to the rich
foods that they tried to feed us. And they did everything possible that they could to alleviate our
worries. I immediately found somebody that knew my sister that came from the town rejoining
me, Slovaki (ph) and he was able to send a telegram to my grandmother in America and my aunt
and uncle and my aunts and that I survived and my father survived.
03:58:54
And we did not stay long in Tarvisio because it was like a detention place. Groups were coming
and leaving further into the coast, into Italy. We went to Bologna. From Bologna we didn't stay
there long at all. We came to Florence, and the first night when we came to Florence we slept in
that magnificent Synagogue, but we slept in the Sunday school that was adjoining the
Synagogue. They took the benches that the children used for sitting on, people used for sitting.
We put the benches and they brought something to lay on top and the first night in Italy we slept
in Florence on the benches. Besides Tarvisio was Italy too but really already away from it. And
we were immediately helped by UNRRA7’ by the United Nations, where they gave us food, and
we were registered with UNRRA and the struggle started how to go to Palestine. The shores of
Palestine were closed and you couldn't go. Meanwhile, my family in America contacted me and
they very, very much wanted me to come to the United States, even if I don't live there merely to
come to see them. They wanted to see me. And since we could not go to Palestine, we decided
to go to the United States. My uncle and Aron's made affidavits for us to come. They send us
passage and everything and we came under the Refugee Act in 1947. We came out to America.
We were married in Rome. We lived from 1945 to '47, we lived in Florence and in Rome. And
Aron and I lived with an Italian family, a Christian family in Rome that took us in as a family.
And we shared our food with them because it was hunger in Italy at this time. And we remained
close friends until today. Shortly we were married in Rome in this magnificent Synagogue with
10 witnesses that we brought with us so the Rabbi could marry us, and we came to the United
States. We came to a loving family that could not do enough for us. We settled in Chicago.
First we came to New York. My father's brother and sister lived in New York. We visited with
them and then we came. We stayed for a while in Indianapolis and then we settled in Chicago.
The families were absolutely wonderful, loving, caring and giving to help us in any possible

way. We had a wonderful life and we're so grateful, because we raised three sons that are
wonderful human beings — Howard, Gordon and Daniel —that are married. We have three lovely
daughter-in-laws; Barbara, Carol and Miriam. And we have eight magnificent grandchildren;
Courtney, 17, that is a Merit Scholar on the way to college. Lindsey, charming and beautiful and
lovely and giving, that told me they went on Thanksgiving Day to serve the hungry dinner, and
the homeless. Ari, Benji and Yalie, the joy, all of them. Evan, bright, wonderful. Rachel,
beautiful, gorgeous to look at, and Gabie, our little Gabriel that is going to be two years old in
December. We tried to instill in them consciousness, good values, morality. And our sons are
physicians, try to prolong human lives, not to take away human lives. Try to help. Aron and I
are both very active with the Holocaust Memorial Foundation in Skokie. I am the chairperson of
the speakers bureau and I truly do what I think I can do to see as a survivor that this never
happens to any people on earth. I feel only by education and only by perpetuating what we
experienced and what we know to leave a legacy for future generations to come. And I very
much felt that this Museum really, truly will do the job when we will not be here anymore. This
is why we came and we want to give this testimony so it remains for generations to come. For
that, I thank you.
