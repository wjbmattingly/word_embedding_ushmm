BEREK DAFNER
September 12, 1994

Q:Stating your name, where you were born and what year.

A:I'm born August 27, 1916 in Sosnowitz, this is Poland. That was on the border from 1916
there was a war, and there was a triangle over there: Austria, Russia and Germany; it was
on the border there. In 1918 after the war, Poland was (Un)occupied from Russia and
they have their own country - Poland.

Q:You know what, I need you to state your name for the record.

A:My name is - I was born Berek Dafner in Poland. Now I change my name here in America -
Dov. Dov is a Hebrew name for Bear.

Q:What was your family life like before the war? Tell me a little bit about the town and what
your father did.

01:02:00 A:My father had a store; leather suitcases and briefcases, skis and sleds. It was a good
business. My father had three children. I have a sister; lives in Florida -
one in Israel. I'm in the middle - the only son. The style in Poland was
comfortable for us. The most people were poor in Poland; eighty percent
at least. I lived comfortable and I was a sportsman; | have time. I use to
play soccer, summertime, all over Poland, and I played table tennis,
wintertime, because I have the money. I wasn't exactly a professional
soccer player but they pay you some money. Of course I didn't need it.

The poor people were playing, they pay more money because they don't
have it.

Q:Were there a lot of Jewish people in your town?

A:Oh ya, there was - the population was, Sosnowitz's was 150,000 but 50,000 Jewish people
were killed.

Q:Now were the Jewish people integrated into the rest of the community? Were most of your
friends Jewish?

A:In Poland, even on the street we were walking - in the main street in Sosnowitz - Saturday,
walking back and forth the Polak they were walking other side - Jewish people on this
side. Never integrated, because you can get a job that's in hospital or to work in an
office... never they took a Jew. Never. They only worked, shoemakers and tailors and
carpenters were Jewish people working. They, always the Polak said, oh the Jewish
people had the money, like over here they said - even in America.

Q:So you experienced a lot of anti-Semitism before the war?

A:Everywhere you go. You go in the evening, Zid(Jew), Zid they says - for Polish a Jew,
because... but, religious people - my father was not that religious but he wear a hat
always whenever... he pray every day, but he was shaving man. Most people wear
beards over there. You know, so right away, a Jew. Over here you cannot recognize a
Jew because everybody wears a beard. But over there, they smell a Jew. Like the Prime
Minister Shamir said, and he was Prime Minister, that a baby sucked the anti-Semit(ism)
from the breasts from his mother because his relatives got killed too, Shamir's, in Poland.

Most anti-Semites were in Poland terrible. Always, they didn't shot nobody, but they
got the chance to beat up the Jewish people.

Q:Did you have bad experiences?

A:Oh ya. I played soccer once in a little town. We were leading, we were a better team, much
better team. It was three to nothing in the half time for us, the Jewish people. They
started yelling to the referee, "If you don't... If you, you'll get killed with the Jews. We
by ourdelves we lost the game because of it. You couldn't get out of town. They beat
you up. I remember in school, I went to the school, they were playing Jews against
Polaks....

Q:I have to stop you for one second. Don't look at Tom. You just need to look - just... sorry.
A:Even in school, they have Jewish schools. There were... going school and you play soccer. If
they win they were always throwing stones against the Jews; every minute, always
against the Jews. We had a Prime Minister called Pilsudski. He was not bad to the Jews.

But he died 1935, 01:06:00 start turning bad. And Hitler was, you know, in Germany
already, and in Poland were a lot of Germans living, a lot of big factories they had - beer
companies - and Sosnowitz was a lot because it was the border over there. It was worse -
worse and worse every time - every time. And I was in the service. A major, always - a
major is higher than a major what is a Colonel - a Colonel - always talk speeches,
anti-Semite speeches over there - in the Army where I was.

Q:In the Polish Army?

Q: We're going to get to that in a minute. [Mrs. Gafner...We'll be okay]

A:From there...

the girls to going out - and I play soccer. There's where... I never was interested in...

there. But who lived over there all the time in Katovitz you could go to Germany without
a pass; no, with a little pass. You can go always. It was... You can go with a streetcar to
Germany from Sosnowitz. It was very close, about nine miles - twelve kilometers is nine
miles.

Q:Now tell me, why did you enlist in the Polish Army? At what age did you enlist. How did
this happen?

A:In 1937 they call us.

Q:Okay, we've got to just - We have to just let him explain.

A:In 1937 when I was twenty - everyone - everybody in Poland has to go through, you know, to
pass a doctor to take you to army. Who was healthy, take you to the army. In 1938, in
March, I went to the army because I was healthy they had the doctor look at me because
they knew me. I play soccer over there in the city and they said they send me to the
army. I play soccer in the army also. I was a healthy guy.

A:Ya. They were all in the same companies. But we have trouble over there too. They give us a
hard time. I have more privilege because I play soccer over there with my... it was a
company - under twenty people - soldiers. I have privileges because a lieutenant play
with me soccer too the goalie. I played better soccer with him. But still they gave a hard
time the Jews. Hard. One guy wanted kill himself it was so hard. He threw himself
from the second floor.

Q:Did you want to be in the army?

A:Who wants to go the Polish Army? Who wants to go over here to the Army? Nobody. But
you have to go. You have to go. I had to enlist myself but you have to go when they call
you.

Q:Now, in the army, what sorts of responsibilities did you have? Where did you go?

A:They tell you... to wake up in the morning - about six o'clock; where you , and
the whole equipment. It was very tough.

Q:I need to stop for a second. You were talking about your daily routine in the army.

A:Ya, how was it? Wake up in the morning. Ah, woke up alarm. You know, how you call...
wake up quick - thirty seconds, whole equipment - in thirty seconds. It is not to punish
you. It was really tough. We have a sergeant over there from Ukraine. Ukranians were
worse than the Poles. Maybe you know from seeing television shows or talk shows. He
01:13:00 never got... He never got a sergeant - this over sergeant - how you call it - a

Ukraines than the Jews because the one that take it over half Ukraine belongs to the
Ukraine use to belong to Poland. But he was very anti-Semite - a big anti-Semite. He
always asked the Jewish soldiers - I was with six other soldiers in the company, Jewish,
they want a schnapps. You know what a schnapps is. They gave it to them and they
really gave them a hard time. I didn't gave it to them. I told my lieutenant about it. He
said don't give him. He give the Jewish people a very hard time. You know -
anti-Semite - like all of them. But the Ukraine... and one time I went, always to the
lieutenant with the whole company - 120 people, you went to make exercise - you know
in the fields. And always not like in Israel or here. The lieutenant went on a horse and
we were walking. So he didn't have the time to come. He said, "I'll be later." The
sergeant, I didn't 01:14:25 want to give him vodka. So he took me to the field and gave
me a hard time over that. The lieutenant didn't see this. All of a sudden he came over, he
saw me staying with the rifle, like this, stretched it out - it was very heavy, you know. A
rifle weighs about seven, eight pounds. With a bayonet, you saw what a bayonet is - with
the stick - maybe ten pounds. You have to hold here by the wood. He came over. He
said, "Put it down." He asked the sergeant what happened. He said to him, "Dov doesn't
make a good exercise." He said, "He doesn't make a good exercise because he's a Jew?
You give him a hard time. He didn't give you vodka." So he screamed to him and
everything. What can he do? Nothing. But I want to tell you the story about
anti-Semites. It is terrible for other Jewish people.

Q:You had... Did Jewish people have less responsibility in the army?

A:Not less, not less. The same responsibility for everybody. But they look down on the Jewish
people, down like you are nothing, in Poland.

01:16:00

Q:Now did you see any fighting?

A:No. No fighting. No.

Q:I mean not so much the... fighting for the Polish Army, not between yourselves.

A:No - Not between. No. Never, never, for they will punish you, but...

Q:I'm sorry. I'm not being clear. In your time in the Polish Army, the first stint, were you on
any fronts? Were you doing any battle?

A: With who?

Q:You were just in training?

A:Ya, all the time. We had a battle with nobody, but we, in 1938,in a placa called Tshechen,
Poland took over a piece. Poland took over a piece from Czechoslovakia. Maybe you
don't remember that - called the Tshechen. And I was over there before the Poland War.
They didn't have connection with the train - with the railroad - to Hungarian. They want
to take it over. So we fought one day. I didn't shoot one bullet against the
Czechoslovakians. Before then we took it over. No - Later the Germans took over
Czechosolovakia. This was later. We fought a day. That's all. This was 1938. We were
in Czechoslovakia in 1938 in October until May, 1939.

Q:Tell me a little bit about your memories of being occupied by Germany. Where were you?
What was happening?

A:Occupied? I was only - I have to tell you the story and I was in the army. Before... If you
want to hear the story about - because 1939, September the first, the Germans took over
Poland - start... You know I was on the border. I wasn't home. I was in the army - not
far from Zakopana - where I use to be in the army. We fought with the Germans until
Lvov near from Lvov, but they were very tough. The Polish army were - took apart -
they have nothing. Horses there. We were running from the Germans. I fought with
them a few times, but mostly we were running. I wasn't home when they start to occupy
Poland. And until September the twenty-fourth, I was in the woods over there before
Lvov over there - you know - you hear from Lvov. And I have to - the Germans took us -
said they're going to bomb the woods over there if we don't give up. So the Polish Army
give up. I have to give my rifle away. They took us to prison. They took us to prison.
We were in a big stadium - in a stadium - they call Javorno(?). Because the Germans and
the Russian were friends. Stalin made a pact with Hitler. They cut in half Poland. So we
were on the side from the Russian side. So they ask us - fifty people wants to go to work
to take the ammunition - you know, in the trucks - they go back on the other side when
the Germans took it over. So... I have a hard time over there. One sergeant that was
over there - a river - told me to wash his horse. He got boots until in the water - I in the
shoes. He didn't know I'm Jewish but this time he start washing. I never in my life
washed a horse. He give me a brush. He came over and said, "You Polak, you swine."
He kicked me in the lower back. Until today - hurts me until today. Okay - let me go
later take a bus - some food to eat and send us back to the stadium. You want to know
how I escape, right? In the stadium they said, "you're going to go to Krakow." You hear
from Krakow. Schindler was over there. The bus from Lvov to Krakow - we 01:21:00
took a train. We took a train to Krakow and the people were living in the - you know, in
the villages and the cities - were jumping in the train. They're shooting after them. You
know, they were on the roofs - the Germans on the roofs. They start to escape who was
living, you know, close to Krakow, or they jump from the train. I didn't escape yet. We

came - we came.... You want to go to Krakow we can't get in because it was closed you
know. The station, a red light was over there. We can't get in. There was on the train
station over there. We stop in Plaszow-Krakow. It was a concentration camp, later I find
out. But they want us take to Krakow. They stopped in the train station because he can't
get in. It was red lights over there. That was about 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock in the 01:22:00
evening. And a German soldier was sitting like you sit over there, with a rifle - and my
car, you know from the train, was I saw him. So I ask him, I can go down - step down, a
little bit of air - because this was a cattle train. There was another Polak soldier over
there was from my home town. So I start talking to those two Polish girls - about
twenties they were. They said to me in Polish, "You better escape from here because if
they take you Krakow, in concentration camps, you gonna die over there. The lice
gonna eat you over there." So I said to them, "No, we were lucky. We are staying over
there until it gets dark. You bring with you (this was a village) those shawls..." Those
shawls - you know - women’ shawls - a big shawl... "with you." They said okay. So
they left. And I know German. I use to go in the school where I live in ?-- . Sol
start talking to the German soldier. Oh, I can go drink water that was over there - a water
fountain. "Von wo kennen Sie Deutsch," he ask me. Why I can German? I said, "Ich bin
von Kattowitz". Kattowitz used to be belong, I told you, until 1918, was Germany.
"Oh," he said, "you are comrade." You know what comrade is? "Oh, you my friend,
Sie werden bald entlassen." He told me that, "You'll go free quick because you're a
German - use to be German over there." I ask him once - I can go drink water - twice.
He told me, "Ja, Sie brauchen doch garnicht fragen." I don't have to ask anymore. "You
go when you want." So I went with my friend - drink water. We were still over there
and it was dark already. So I went - drink water. I saw the 01:24:00 girls over there
with the shawls. When they gave me the shawls I throw away my soldier coat with my
hat and we went to the village over there. They didn't know I'm Jewish. I was a corporal.
Very seldom in Poland they have a corporal, an officer has to be very educated; Begin

was an officer. You know Begin - used to be the Prime Minister. He was in the same
Polish Army. So I went out in the village. So I changed clothes with a man over there.
He gave me a old hat with a jacket - a short pants. Not shaved, I looked like a poor man.
And they feed us a little bit. I have about 100 kilometers - this is about seventy miles - to
home. It was a straight road. And that Polak, the other friend, had money. He bought a
bicycle. He left. I didn't have money on me, but I had two, three dollars. So they told
me, you know what.... They wanted my shoes too. I said, "No. This is soldiers shoes. I
have to walk." They told me, "Take the streetcar and go about twenty kilometers - you
have farther to your hometown." So I took the streetcar and I stepped down after the
streetcar - I had about (how much?) - still I had about forty miles to go 01:26:00 home.
There was two little cities over there. They're called Cherbina. There was another city,
Charnov after this. Cherbina - between Cherbina, Charnov when they took over Poland -
the Germans - said this will be Germany until - Charnov. Cherbina with Krakow, this
will be occupied - they call occupied. So between those two cities, I wake up in the
morning I have still forty, fifty Kilometers to walk. I woke up in the morning, I want to
walk. I saw over there two SS people - you know, two SS. It was not a - really a border,
but they were standing over there. I had no documents. I was afraid. All of a sudden a
Polish guy on a bicycle, he passed the border. So they started yelling after them. They
took their bicycles and run after him. I was lucky - very lucky. So I started walking. All
of a sudden I see a horse with a wagon - you know, an open wagon - how you call the
platform wagon. Not - not in the sides. I saw my uncle with a friend and two women on
the platform. I saw my uncle. I say, "hold it. Who are you poor man, Who are you?"
They didn't recognize me. "Who are you?" I said, "I'm Berek." I took off my hat. Almost
fainted because it was on the 26th of September Germany took over everywhere. They
thought home that I'm 01:28:00 dead already. I was in the war. They said, "You know
what. Step up on the wagon. We go. I buy apples over there - all kinds of things." I
said, "No, I'm not going with you over there. The SS over there. Don't go over there," I

told him. "Don't go." He gives me five dollars and I went later to a bakery and I bought
something. Was not bread but I pay more money. You know - everything was black
market. I was not hungry anymore. | started walking home. I lived on a street - I guess
it was the corner. I lived here - and I came over here. And at that corner I had about two
more blocks to go. At the corner I saw my aunt. We live together; not the same
apartment but right on the same... with a friend. I said, "Tante Chaya", you know what a
Tante is? And she said, "Who are you?" I was not shaved - old hat, and she fainted...
she fainted. So, go 01:29:30 quick home. It was about 5 o'clock in the evening. Where
Luse to live there was a big house - sixty... was sixty apartments. Not condominiums;
apartments - rent. In the house in Poland was like this. They would have a gate - in
every house a gate you can't get in after 10 o'clock in the evening. You know, over there,
a Polish guy (Doorman)- you know the streets, a . So I went over there. He
wanted to see me because I escaped from the Germans. So I knock on the door and
where the maid... She opened the door and I put my foot in between. I said, "Can I talk
to Mr. Dafner?" She said, "Mr. Dafner... They were eating dinner... A poor man asks
for you." I didn't know the maid. But my mother recognized my voice. [pause]

Q:Okay, you arrived at your house, and your mother...

A:My mother heard my voice. This is bad. They stop eating. Now imagine how I come in.
They brought right away a barber to 02:01:00 shave me and to cut my hair. Okay. We
went to sleep - oh. The whole family came over there. Sisters, brothers, everybody over
there. I said, "Don't make a noise. I escaped from the prison." The Germans were
already in Poland - in my city, everywhere. At 5 o'clock in the morning I hear noise in
the halls. "What's going on?", I said. My both sisters, my father and mother to go and
stand in the line for bread. I say, "I go by myself. I bring more bread than you." I have

know, goyim, the gentiles, knew me. We won't let you go . All four, they brought
maybe a half a loaf of bread. So next time I went. Everybody knew me over there.
Always the people would stay in the line, you know. But I do it too - two loaves of
breads in half an hour. I didn't stand in line. I saw what's going on later. My father said
to me like this, "Go in the Jewish Community Center. Sign over there so you get - a
piece of bread - you know - you get over there rations." I said, "I don't wanna go. I
escaped from the Germans over there. I'm afraid." He was afraid not to go, so I went
over there. I talked to the main man over there. His name was Mottel Marrin. They told
me later the Germans killed him. He was no good to the Jewish people later. And I went
to him, "Listen, I was in the army eighteen months and I escaped from the prison. Don't
send me to work because I saw my friends sweeping the streets." The Jewish people...
the Germans... "Don't send me over there." It was about two months. All of a sudden
they send me a paper to go sweep the street. I said, "uh, uh." I wouldn't go. But hear
over the radio home, the Russian side, the Jewish people over there singing Jewish. I
said, "I have to escape to the Russian side." A lot of people were escaping because they
have many Jewish people alive now on the Russian side. My mother was crying, "You
just came back from the army." I said, "I'm not going to stay with what's going on." I
went to the street and told the Jewish people not to walk on the sidewalk or in the street.
They beat up girls over there. They didn't care the young - Hitler jung they call -
you know, those young. When they sent me the paper after two months it was already, I
think, November. It was colder over there - snow. I said to my father, "I'm going the
other side - the border." So he put in money over here.... and I took shoes and clothes -
how you call when your carrying in the school... the schoolchildren are wearing those....
a backpack? And I took saccharin with me. It was very expensive this stuff. I took two
kilos, two packages. It was very cheap - 100 Zlotys, that's all. Iknew. Somebody
told me on the other side, the Russian side, you could get a lot of money for it. So, all of

wants to go over the border. She wants to go. She knows a gentile over there - how to
cross - there was a river there. They have a little boat. You pay them money. So I went
all day long - - [have to hide. I hid in a basement somewhere. In the evening I
went to another city. I went to the border with my aunt - over the border. The Polak took
us. We paid him a hundred zlotys (?)dollars. We come the other side, the Russian caught
us. Put us in jail. The women separate. My aunt I never saw anymore. There were
seventy people in a room - a little bigger - like my dining room. Seventy people who
couldn't lay down on the floor - even sleep - sitting all night. I was over there ten days.
They let us go.

Q:Now this was all Jewish prisoners, or Polish prisoners?

A:02:06:00 There was a few Polish too. But most were all Jewish people. I came out from the
prison. I was not shaved. I went to a barber over there. He said "Are you a
Bergenist(ph)? Bergenist is called the escapee. He said Will you give me a few
saccharin - maybe you have? Ten saccharins I shave you and cut your hair. "a
little bit. I gave it to him - saccharins. So I said, "it must be..." I ask him "Is it expensive
over here? How much cost a kilo of saccharin?" He said two thousand dollars. I paid a
hundred dollars. Because everything was inflated by the Russians. They've got nothing.
It was very bad in Russia. I slept in the church over there.

Q:Do you remember the name of the town that you were close to? This prison?

A:This prison? It was the word Przemysl. It was... (The word) Przemysl was divided between
the same city divided - between the Germans and the Russians. I was on the other side -

friends and relatives. I went over there with him. I have to work. In Russia you have to
work. I was an electrician. I learned something in Poland - an electrician. I want to
go to the Maccabiade. You know what the maccabiade is? To Israel. So I learn a year
and a half to be electrician. So I work a littLe bit and over there there was a very little
town. I lived over there for five dollars a week. They feed me and sleep over there. A
horseshoe maker - What do you call it in English? [A blacksmith]. A blacksmith - I live
with the blacksmith. He has over there a daughter. Why he took me in for so cheap you
think? He wants me involved with the daughter. For five dollars. And my friends - We
went out. We went out dancing over there. We were working over there. In 19... This
was 1939. He told us..., the baker told us, "They're not going to change the money." I
have Polish. They're going to change the money. January the first there going to be only
Russian money. But they're not going to exchange. You're losing everything. So the
baker said, "So, give me the money and I exchange." The baker was like a god by the
Russian - you know, bread. So he gave it to us, Russian - Russian money. They all
thought we were going to marry their daughters. And I went back over there and I find
out in the work, I have a cousin over there. Her name was Sara Dombrovsky. I find out
she lives over there and she is working - going to live in an apartment. She lived - a
gentile was in her apartment. And you want to know how they took me to Siberia?

Q:But we want to ask you a first questions first. Lvov at that point was Polish or Russian - I
mean German or Russian?

A:No, no, no. Lvov was the Russian side. Ya, on the Russian side because I escaped to the
Russian side Przemysl. After Przemysl this was about fifty, sixty kilometers was Lvov.

A:Ya, there was a lot of... They took... The whole Ukraine they took it over, the Russian. It use
to be Ukraine once.

Q:Let me ask you. When you were thinking of going to the Russian side, you're feeling was that
you would have better possibilities with the Russians than with the Germans or the Poles?

A:Ya, because they didn't send you to concentration camps. I saw what's going on in the street.
They beat up people wherever I go. You can't walk on the sidewalk. I saw this, I say -
and I hear them over there, Jewish theatre playing on the radio. And everything - a lot of
people - a lot Jewish people escape over there. I wish - half Poland went over there
because a shoemaker and a dressmaker ,a tailor - would make a good living over
there in Russia. A very good living.

Q:Did your..... When you went back to your town after you escaped from the Germans, was
your town formed into a ghetto at that point - or not yet?

A:lt was not yet. I'll find out they made a ghetto later. 1940 I think. But I wasn't there.

Q:But were there already restrictive laws?

A:Ya, always for the Jews. Everyone restricted. The Jewish Community has to do what the
German told them. I saw what was going on over there. I knew when to leave over
there.

Q:Was there a Jewish government in place, a Judenrat?

children?

A:Women and children... I went over there with the families because single people they took to
a tough, tough place worse than mine. I went with the families because I was with my

Germans against the Russians. This was 1940. It was better over there in that place -
much better than someplace else because the war looked from over there gold. We cut
trees - 3 meters and 240. Under ground they're looking for gold. This was to hold the
ceilings. They start working the girls, were burning the... how you call those pieces from
the side - thin pieces... how you call in English [twigs or branches] - branches. The girls
were burning the branches. The old people were burning the branches. We worked very
hard from seven in the morning, it was dark. It was only light over there, you know,

when I sent this to Poland that I have not what to eat, where to sleep and where to live. I
received a package from twenty kilo. This is more than forty pounds - from Poland. The
war started exactly, I received. So what do I did? I burned all my clothes because
everybody has lice. Russia - everybody. And I change my clothes. But two beautiful
suits what I wear once or twice - and underwear - warm underwear - heavy 02:21:00
underwear - everything. I have to go to work again. So I took a nice suit. I go to the
woods, work. He told me that, the foreman told me, "You're going to tear up this nice
suit. Give it to me and I give you warm clothes." Warm clothes and warm boots over
there - special. "I give you a hat. I give you everything. I give you money. Give me
that suit." I asked that old man, "What I have to do?" He said, "Give it to him. You're
going to tear up in the woods quick." I gave it to him. He give me money. He give mea
break at work - not to work that hard. What he did, when we cut trees - three yards, four
yards, you know - we have to put square. They were measured in square yards. They
said so, "with your friend, take this - this wood - put it over there today. Tomorrow put it
back." We have easy. Because I give him the suit he was happy with it.

Q:What was the point - you're moving it back and forth?

A:To give me a break - nothing to do. So I would not have to cut trees, because he mark it -
when we cut the trees and every piece he marked - that we did this. It was in Russia like
this. Everything was crooked over there and everyone was lie. So, and the war started. I
had the package.

Q:Let me ask you a question. How did somebody know where you were to send this package to
you?

A:My family they have to went... They have to go to other city to a gentile to send me a
package. So I was lucky, very lucky. With that package I am still alive today because all
things over there I would have to eat later. The war started in 1941. You know - the
Germans started the war with the Russians - 1941, June twenty-second. So I told the
people over there, "I bet you now we're going to be free." They were laughing at me.
Siberians, they told us. In Russia they told us, "You're going to die over there." The
KGB told us. I told you, 1941 they started talking about something. I hear they're leave
us alone. This was in October I think - 1941. The Commandant - you know,
Commandant - from the KGB called us separate. I came in. He said, "what happened?"
I said, "We'll be free." "You want to work here? We'll pay you five times as much." I
said, "thank you very much." He showed me a map - where I want to go. "Tell me to
where's warm." We went Asia - not far from the Iran border - Persian border over there -
called Uzbekistan, Tashkent. All Jewish people went over there. So I took. They give
me a ticket for food and everything.

Q:Now did the paper say that you were Jewish or Polish?

A:No, no, no. They didn't ask me. When they ask me I say I am Polish - not Jewish. Always
say a Polak.

Q:Why did they release you?

A:They release everybody because we were Polish - from Poland. They released us because they
start making a Polish army - in Russia. They released us into - The same guy who bought
from me the suit, he told me: "You want to make a few dollars? Take with you tabak
(tobacco)Mahorka packages." Take with you how much you can. But in Russia you
have to know how to live because people were dying in the street... you know, with the
war. And the Germans, you know, they went forward city by city. I took with me how
much | can put in Rucksack, put it in a few hundred pieces. And he said, "Sell it on the
stations when they stop the train." - because we come over there to Tashkent, it is very
cheap over there. So I started to make a few roubles, sol had something to eat later. I
came over then to Tashkent, the city. We were sleeping on the ground in our garden over
there. I had a little soap, you know. I have money. I can buy something from black
market. But nobody was bothering us. No Russian, no nothing was bothering us. We
were free. We had it better than the Russians. You know, some Russians like to escape
from the army. You know, there are all kind of people over there - Asian, Arabs - like
the Arabs - the whole Muslims. They didn't like to go... We went into the market to buy
something, sometimes the KGB come over, surrounded everybody, or somebody, and

conditions that you haven't already...?

A:Ya. They keep an eye on you the KGB over there. Every minute you can go nowhere. It is
very tough. Only to be over there two months summer and winter over there all the time

A:No. Catch as catch (can). Because they got nothing over there. You see what's going on.
You never know. Nobody knew what's going on in Russia. They have nothing over
there. They never had nothing. Everyone has lie. I'll tell ya later the story of... what
kind of lie they have. They send me to work later, when I was free. They took away my

the same needle. Me, I say, uh, uh. I don't want - because they don't have nothing.

those people like the Iranians - like the Arabs over there. They are all Muslims. Most
people over there are all Muslims and the nurses were Russian. So they were dying like
flies over there - from the typhus. They feed me. They gave it tome. They keep me
over there three months in the hospital. Should go out after two weeks. They wrote
down that I have fever. I was lucky. I came out from the hospital and I met over there...
when I came out from the hospital... six friends. Not friends, but six people - six Jewish
people. 03:06:00 Two were tailors, shoemakers - and I have some money - and they
have money. I say, "Let's... I don't want to live in this city." Very expensive - everything
- bread was - a loaf of bread was... use to be two dollars a pound and it was 180. You
can only buy in Russia - you can get everything on the market, because the people from
the villages. They came over. They brought everything over. Only everything is black
market, but was allowed to the people from the villages they brought over because they
were growing things in the field. So I say, "We have money. Everybody let's go toa
place where it's very cheap." Over the sea was over there, like a island - little island -
living there 5,000 people. We went over there. It was very cheap food. Very cheap food
was over there - ten dollars was a kilo of bread. Over here it was a hundred eighty. We
have to go to work. Me and my friend - he was from Warsaw - they give us a horse with
a wagon. What we have to do? He said to bring bricks - to build houses - five times a
day - bring from the factory over there. One of our friends he was the a foreman. They
made him a foreman. Took over to write down how many bricks I brought, what I
brought. Everything for the buildings what they built over there - some houses. There
was all kind things over there. So we brought over until five times, bricks. Five wagons
- We wrote three times. He wrote it down that we brought five. It was over there
millions of bricks. They didn't know over there - the big shots - they didn't know. It's
going on in Russia like this. Everything was a lie. The rest of the time we went to the....
People coming in from Ukraine, you know they escape from the war, so we went over

it over - from the people. I forgot to tell you something from Siberia. How is Russian -
is working over there. They Took us one time about one hundred people to walk over -
take out potatoes from the ground. They didn't have machines to take out the potato -
with their hands. They told us two people have to make five sacks in eight hours
potatoes. Nobody could make this. You can make a lot if you make two of them. My
ration guy told us, "You see over there? Millions of potatoes with sacks over there.
Make two and take from over there three." So we did - everybody from the hundred
people - took from there three sacks. Was millions over there - sacks of them. When we
finished work, the foreman came over and marked that we did 100% work. And we...
They put it back on that pile of sacks over there. So, this is the story how the whole was
a lie. We left, other people coming over and did the same thing. Everything goes in the
paper. There is nothing, never.

Q:They weren't as efficient as the Germans?

A:No, the Russians - They didn't care. They didn't like to work. Only to doing vodka. They
didn't like to work. There was a Kolkhoz - you know Kolkhoz - there was, how you call
it...2 You have to work on a farms. They write it down and after a day they give you
food. They call it KOLkhoz. Like in Israel they call a kibbutz. But in kibbutz they have
what to eat. Over there they didn't have what to eat. Ya,... We went to that island
right? I told you, to that island.

Q:In Uzbekistan ?

living)(?). One time we came back from work. A woman was yelling, "My husband
died." "So, what do you want from me?" "Can you bury him?" My friend says - he was
6'2", 250 pound my friend - "Let's bury him. Make some money." So we took him over
there. We bury him - not too deep. Make maybe two feet - make a hole two feet - a little
sand over there on top. We make more money in two hours more than I work in a half a
year. We 03:12 did everything. And this was in 1943. All of a sudden the Russians
send us a paper. We have to take Russian passport. I had a paper from Siberia I told you
- with a paragraph I'm a Polish citizen. So we were standing in line - a Polak. A Gentile
was standing before me. The KGB ask him questions: You want to take a Russian
passport? He said, "No. I'ma Polish citizen." He say, "You eat Russian bread, you have
to take." This is the only country in the world where they force you to take a passport. In
America you have to wait six years to have passport. He said, "No." They took him
away. So I said, ah, ah. They ask me. I was in the line. "You take a Russian passport?"
"Sure." Okay, so I went to the other door. There was over there a young lady. I knew
her. You want Russian pass? I say, "Yes." For how many years? For five years - or six
months, a temporary?" I say, "I take a temporary." They took away my paper. We knew
each other. There was five thousand people. They were dancing over there..., they
were.... Then she asks me, I believe in God. I say, "Yes." Where's God ? Let's
not talk about it. She didn't believe in God. You know, the Communists. Later they
took us away to send us to work. It is cold again. This called Ural Mountains. You hear
from this? The City was Ufa. And we went to work over there. They said... There's a
factory over there. If you want to hear another lie what's going on over there. We went
over there to work. They make soda soda - some kind of powder for the airplanes. They
said so. I was working electrician over there. The people were there - was Uzbekistan
you know - those Arabs. They live over there, all their life in a warm climate. Come
over. It was cold over there. They were dying like flies from the cold. They have to
work outside.

A:No. They never worked with me. I was electrician. But they were working groundwork - you
know - with the shovel they have to make ditches over there for that cables. They're
making over there a station to the factories - and would work. They start working over
there. After six months I see in the newspaper. They have already so many thousand
kilos soda they made. The factory didn't started yet. They didn't put the cable in. They

A:No. They didn't like us. They didn't like the Russian people. They didn't like us. I said, "We
are from Poland." They didn't know what Poland is. They say, "Parusky. Parusky -
Russian." We went one time. They send us to Russia to work over there for... five
friends and those Muslims. They want to give us nothing to eat. We have to escape.
Bad - very bad people. They didn't like it. You know, they were with Hitler, you know -
Egypt. When the Germans went in Africa or close to - all Arab - all Arab countries were
close with the Germans.

A:We - The girls liked us - the girls over there - Polish people. They know how to dance - you
know. The Russians dance only Kosacks. Oh, the very much Polaks came over. We
were all very lucky over there. So we had to work to eat 03:18 and everything, but they
give us a pass to a good restaurant. There were big people eating. I met over there - a
girl over there - a Jewish girl over there. She was a secretary from the big shots over
there. She invite me to her mother always - Her husband got killed in the war - to eat
over there. I was going out with her about three months I think. One time they made
their own field - all kind of things. You know, tomatoes and this and that. I helped them
out - potatoes - Her mother said, "This is gonna be enough for the whole winter for all
three of us?" I sort of smelled something - I didn't like it. I bet you want me to get
married to her daughter. So I... I left her... but I made it out like this. I don't want to get
married over there.

Q:While you were over there, what information did you have about the war and the
concentration camps and all of that? Did you know what was going on?

A:We were far away - too much - we didn't know. We knew only the Germans... the war over
there... they were very bad. I was away from Poland about 5,000 kilometers. Far - about
3-4,000 miles away. We didn't know much but we know in the newspaper we didn't read
too much. I was a young man. I read a little bit Russian but - we knew it was very bad.

Q:But you didn't know about the camps in Poland or...?

A:No. Eh, we hear something more or less but we didn't know about it. We were looking for
piece of bread over there. Everybody - People would die. My friends bury his mother

there, I told you - in the factory over there.... Leningrad was surrounded, you know, a
year and a half from the Germans over there. It was really a bad time - very bad.

Q:So what happened next?

03:20

A:1944 - It was 1944 - I hear the Germans started running. You know. After Stalingrad, you
remember, some they took so many - 20,000, 50,000 - 250,000 people and the
soldiers - the German soldiers to prison - they started running. Like we were running in
1939. So they call us to the army. They didn't go. I said, "I go." By myself I want to go
because they almost took over. They were close to Poland. They took me to the army
and they ask me what nationalization Iam. They write it down over there. I said, "I'm
Polish." I didn't say, "I'm Jewish," because if I said the Jewish I go to the Russian army.
I want to go to the Polish army. So I said, "Polish. - Polak." They took me to Polish
army. And I went over there to the army and it was close to... I told you about
Majdanek, remember? Over there it was a death camp.

Q:Why did you want to...? [Discussion re window]. Now why did you want to be in the Polish
army instead of the Russian army?

03:22:30

A:Why? Cause I'm from Poland. I use to be in the Russian army. I was a corporal.

Q:In the Polish army.

A:I was in the Polish army I told you in 1938, 1939 and I know the language and I... They take
me to the Russian army and... I don't know what's going on. But in the Polish army I
was more comfortable.

Q:But the Poles weren't so nice to you.

A:No. In the army I ama corporal. They will listen to me. This is before the war. Over there
they have to shut up. They were Russian. The Polish Army - Who make the Polish
army? The Russians. They were the watchdog over the Polish Army. They made the
Polish Army. They call Wassilevska(ph) Army. They won't have to listen to the... We
always... When the Russian were fighting we were always behind them. They didn't
trust the Polaks. Always - after them we came right away. So I went to Polish Army.

Q:I'm a little confused, cause I don't know this history as well as you. So this was a Polish Army
that was under the command of the Russians?

A:Of the Russians. That's right. We were wearing those clothes - Polish clothes.

Q:And was this a breakoff part of the Polish Army? It wasn't the main Polish Army cause that
was really - It folded under the Germans. Right?

A:No. This was... It used to be 1942, there was a Polish army from the right wing. The main
general was in England. They went over there with the Polish Army - They went over
there under supervision of the English. They went to Persia and Iran - Later they were in
Israel.

Q:So this is a little different than the Poles who tried to stand strong against the Germans in
1939. This is a different group?

A:Ya..., This is not a right wing. They make... They're communists - Russians - They made a
army under supervision of them. They keep an army. But it was not the right wing. The

right wing, they still was in England. When they built a army they were altogether the
peasants. Behgin(ph) over there - He was in the army over there. They didn't let me go
over there because I'm Jewish. I want to go to Persia - in 1942. Cause I'm Jewish, don't
wanna take me. But this 03:25army - the Polish army doesn't matter because it was under
supervision of the Russian army. So I went over there and we were close to that
Majdanek. The Russian took it over. We came in almost together with the Polish army.
They surrounded.... They caught over there six... seven - seven SS - the main SS, you
know where they doing charge on that Majdanek in the death camp. There was one guy
over there kill himself - one German. He took out people teeth - gold teeth - people.
They were alive. They took out with a plier. He kill himself. When we came in the
ovens still were burning - the smoke still came out. I didn't know what's going on. There
was seven fields over there - seven ovens over there. You know. You saw what they
looked like. You were in Auschwitz - the oven. It was still smoking. Saw thousand - a
hundred thousand of shoes - hair from women. And ..terrible. I didn't know nothing
about it. Was terrible. So they made over there not a company, but a platoon from
people who were electricians, tailors, mechanics - to fix tanks and tractors. So I was too.
I didn't went to the war anymore. What do you want to know now?

Q:Well, how long were you in Majdanek?

A:Over was over there, Majdanek,... The army, the Russian army went to the... to Warsaw.
They were standing over there - was a river over there they called Vistula. The Germans
were on the other side. The war over there, you know, the Polish, the Polaks, were
fighting the Germans over there and they broke down the whole city of Warsaw. Maybe
you know. They begged the Russians to come over - to help. The Russians don't wanna.
They didn't like the Polaks. They didn't like the Germans. They kill each other over
there. And I was over there in Lublin. This is where Majdanek is. And the fourteenth of

January the Russians start offensive across the Vistula - across the river. The Germans
were running away. In February, I think... maybe earlier, Russian took over the whole
Poland. So a lot of people from concentration camps came home. I didn't know. I went
home in March.

Q:Wait. Let's... I don't want... Let's stay with this a little bit longer. Was Majdanek the only
camp that you liberated?

A:Ya. This is the only one. Auschwitz was far away from over there.

Q:Did you do any fighting - any fighting besides...?

A:Ah - No. I don't... Because they want to send me later to fight but they built a - I told youa
platoon to fix... They need people - mechanics, electricians, thus and thus. I was lucky.

03:29

Q:I'm sorry. We're going to change tapes.

Q:Okay. I'm back to Majdanek. What were the prisoners like? What kind of condition were
they in? What did you see?

A:What kind of condition is... I don't remember how many - how many were over there - not too
many. You saw the skeletons - how they look like. Uh. They were crying. I don't know
what to tell you. They were terrible - Like you see in the television sometimes - from
Auschwitz, everywhere. Terrible, terrible shape. Women without hair. They shave it
off. They make lamps from it. You know. I didn't know about it myself. So many
shoes - children's shoes - mountains of shoes. It was terrible. There were gentiles too

with me together there. They always said, "The Jews, they killed Jesus. Who cares about
the Jews." - openly.

Q:Even at Majdanek?

A:You didn't saw Shoah, the film Shoah. Did you see he said that from the train there - He
said... They took the Jews. Now they said, always they said, the same thing.

Q:But even when they arrived in Majdanek they said that?

A:Ah... Not in openly but always. The Polaks were...

Q:How did the prisoners react to you?

A:They were afraid. When we came over there they didn't know us. We came over there...
They didn't know... they saw army you know. They was frustrated. You know - about
work you know. We had to carry them out. We feed them. They died you know. They
couldn't eat. It was terrible. It was terrible. The Russian people - The Russians, they
came over right away from America - from England over there. They flew in, you know,
from America always - because the Russians didn't have too much. Americans
everything. I told you. Flowers they send. I ate the flowers in Siberia with Americans.

Q:How did the Russians treat the prisoners?

A:Very good. Ya. They have to went to the front. They lost maybe twenty, thirty million
people. You kidding? They were fighting. They were good fighters. They're hungry
and they fight for their land. But they were - Everybody feel sorry, even the worse

people over there - with no hearts. They would see how the people look like. It was
terrible. I don't know what more can I say. We see a oven - still smoking. I didn't know
what it was, they told me. They said over in the porter then in the building.

Q:Can you remember what was going through your mind at the time?

A:What can I say? Anybody was feeling terrible - nauseous - when you see something like this.
It was terrible - terrible - terrible scene. Even you look in a picture - people over there -
skeletons came out. Even in a picture you see alive over there how they look like. A lot
of 04:04 people died. They want to eat. They were hungry, you know. They were
dying from dysentery, you know, most of them. But, some of them they came out alive.
Those six SS - they made a trial... an open trial. But the Polaks over there killed them.
Why did they have to make a trial? They made a trial over there. They took six trucks in
a field and hanged em.

Q:Was this while you were there?

A:Ya - still over there in Lublin - ah, Majdanek - the city was Lublin.

Q:Were there a number of Germans still there upon your arrival?

A:No, no, no. They caught the SS - the main... Maybe the Russian later caught them. They
were running. They took a lot of prisoners. They sent them right away to Siberia. You
know. They didn't play around.

Q:So when you arrived at the camp the Germans were all gone?

A:Everything gone - ya.

Q:Those SS - They caught them. What they did with the other Germans - the soldiers - I don't
know. I think they sent them away right away - because they caught a quarter million,
you know, from Stalingrad. Then the Russians knew what to do with them. Don't worry
about it. They sent them to work over there with no food.

Q:So what you saw - these six SS officers being hung - you saw them hung. They had been
caught, but outside of the camp?

A:They caught them inside the camp. If not they would escape together with the other soldiers.
I didn't saw how they caught them.

Q:The reason I'm asking you this is because I understood that in certain camps, if the Germans
were still there when they were liberated, a lot of the prisoners retaliated. You know, the
prisoners....

A:No, no. I didn't see this. A lot of the prisoners - I tell you about that - too weak. They took, if
they're caught, those SS - they're surrounded - I bet they caught a lot of soldiers over
there. If they caught the main shots I bet you. But I didn't see it. Maybe they took them
right away.

Q:Did anything else you can remember about when you arrived in Majdanek and what you saw
while you were there and any particular experiences?

A: 2? They were hugging us - who was in better shape. It was terrible, terrible, terrible.
Some of them the better shape. But most of them were skeletons. Some of them who
were over there they were working or - were the tailors you know. And the sew always

something for the Germans you know. Some of them - not too many - were in good
shape... Not too many. It was terrible scenes. Terrible. In Auschwitz was worse. But I
say that what I hear. I never been in Auschwitz.

Q:I'm just trying to get a sense of what you found when you arrived in Majdanek .

04:08

A:What can be worse - the ovens smoking - and the skeletons over there and so many mountains
with shoes. You realize what they did to the Jewish people. There were over there
gentiles also but 90% were Jewish people because they separate always the Jewish people
with the gentiles.

Q:So this was probably your first realization of what had been happening while you were in
Russia.

A:Ya. Because I didn't know. I was far away - thousands, thousands of kilometers. I knew they
were bad over there. There was rumors over there - killing people. You understand they
did anything they wanted to come in the city. The soldiers said, "It's not our fault. The
Captain said to do it." They took away everything what they could and they sent it to
Germany. When I was in Germany and my wife bought it over there - to light a candle -
candlelights [candelabra] from silver - and the Germans stole... with the Jewish, you
know, over there. They came over. They took everything from the house -
everything. They can say war. It was very tough. When you caught them they were so
afraid. I was surprised. When you caught a prisoner over there they were so afraid
terrible because they knew what they did to everybody. It was terrible. I can tell you
after this I came home if you wanna know - in March - and the Germans start to escape.
The Russians were after... the Polish army the Russian went. They started running - like
we were running in 1939. I came home in March with the train. I was standing about

twenty kilometers from Warsaw. In Warsaw there was no one house left. They bombed
everything over there, the Germans. 04:10 The whole city. I went home. I came home
to the same house. There lived only gentiles over there. Everywhere. So I asked the
janitor. I saw he was sweeping the floor - was the street. I asked him, "Where you live?"
He use to live in basement. He say, "Over there." There was a house - maybe four or
five rooms. A rabbi use to live in it - a rich rabbi. They have over those Hassidim. You
know Hassidim there. He taught... No - homeless Russian. I went over there. I knock
on the door. I was in soldier clothes - you know, of corporal. "Who is it?" she ask me. It
was 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the morning. I say, "Polish soldier." She opened the door.
She didn't recognize me. "Who are you? What do you want?" I took off my hat.
"Nobody lives from your family." "Who is living in my house?" "Gentiles." "Don't go
over there," she said. "Why shouldn't go over there?" They took away. They took away
my father, my mother, everything. She gave me tea. I came over there about 8 o'clock or
9 o'clock over there. I knock on the door. A women over there - Polak. She had a child
maybe ten, twelve years. I say, "Can I go in?" She said, "Yes." She look - "Corporal."
She didn't know I'm Jewish. I look. ?.? Can I go in there - bedroom,
dining room. She said, "Why not. Look around." She said, "What you looking for?" I
said, "I use to live over here." "But the Jewish people use to live over there." Said, "I'm
Jewish." I look around again. She said, "What are you looking for, gold?" "No." The
Polaks, they always thought the Jewish had.... I was so frustrated. I had my gun with
me, you know. I took her by the hair and I knock her down. It was concrete steps. I
throw her on..... I didn't know what to do - else. I would kill her. I didn't find nobody in
there. She ask me if I'm looking for gold. And the other gentiles running around. "Mr.
Corporal, what happened?" So, I left. I was so angry - Terrible. I went to the
community center - the Jewish community center - to find somebody. They told me over
04:13:30 there, "There's much people still in concentration camp." But my cousin was
free already. Of course he was in Poland - in concentration camps - not far from

Warsaw. He barely walk around. He lives now in Chicago. They told me nobody -
nobody. So I left a note over there in the Jewish community center that I'm in the army -
twenty kilometers from Warsaw. When the war ended my sisters were in concentration
camp. One was in Czechoslovakia and one was - still was Germany - but the Polish army
later took it over - a big piece from Germany. Silesia that is called. And I went back to
the army over there. After the war - finished May 5th. About in a week or two
somebody told me that some young woman waiting for me outside. [Obvious crying].
Was my sister. She lives in Israel. So I got two days off. Later she left. She was
working in - with my younger sister - in... She knew German, so she work in office over
there - a Jewish community center. There was occupied by Poland now - they took over
a big piece from Silesia - from the Germans. So, I came over there. That's where I meet
my wife. So I went to the Kattowitz. She use to live in 04:16 Kattowitz. So over there I
took a train. There were three cars - soldier cars. And the rest were a train - you know -
the civilian people. And this lady over there, my wife, I don't know... She had packages
- all kind packages. And she wants to go in the train where the soldiers are. I didn't
know she's Jewish. I told her, "Get down." Thought she's a shiksa. I was made on the
gentiles, you know. They help out the Germans. Why the Germans made those
concentration camps - death camps - in Poland? They knew they had good friends
because they were big anti-Semites - you know - the Polaks. So she said she can in the
civilian train because a lot of people are over there. I thought she is not Jewish. I didn't
let - everyone was wounded soldiers still over there. But later I found out - a friend -
another young lady - came over... A big nose with black hair. So I met my wife. So she
went over there, for a wedding over there, where my sister was working in Silesia, you
know. She invite me to the wedding. I tooked all of her packages for she made business.
She had... You know what kind of business? Yeast - you know yeast when you baking

wedding. And we got married. I have over there those friends from my girlfriend - my
girlfriends I told you. A friend she married a officer from the Polish KGB. And they ask
me to join them. I was a soldier. I don't know what to do. I said, "I don't wanna."
Everyone say, "Ah, come over." I told them I don't wanna because they're right wing.
The right wing from the Polish army they use to be - they were killing Russian officers -
and the Polish officers you know. They were against the Communists. I joined them.
Okay. One time I was with them. I don't know - remember - a month or two months or
something. One guy he had always a machine gun on him. He was afraid. Those right
wing they were like partisans against the Polish Communist regime now. I went from
Kattowitz where I live over there to my home town Sosnowitz. One time we saw behind
us a car, right? I ask him, "What's going on?" They start shooting at us. We barely
escaped. I say, "uh, uh. I don't want to stay here. I gonna escape to Germany." What I
did - my sister was - my younger sister from Florida, right - you knew? So I went to the
Russian border - to the Czechoslovakian border. There were the Russians over there.
They took it over - occupied this time. So I said, "Don't worry. I know Russian. I go."
You are gonna go to the Czechosolovakia. I had with me two bottles - whiskey -
schnapps. I know they like it. I had one suitcase in my hand and I stopped a Russian guy
with a truck. He got hay - hay, straw over there - hay on top. "Hey, I want to go the
other side." What do you have?" Who gave it tom? "Who are the girls?" I said, "One
for me and one for you." It was my sister with my wife. I knew them very well. We
cam over the border - the other side. A officer stopped him. He has to go back to
Poland. I said, "Give me one girl." I said, "This is my wife and my sister." We were
cheating, he was a nice guy. I him the two bottles vodka. He left. So we went to Prague
