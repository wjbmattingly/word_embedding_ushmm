NORBERT WOLLHEIM
May 17, 1994
Question: Could you tell me your full name again please?
Answer: My name is Norbert Wolheim. I was born on April 26th, 1913, in Berlin, Germany.
Question: OK. Norbert, where we left off, we were talking about Auschwitz and you had been
describing its . There were some stories about Auschwitz that you had wanted to share with
me in particular.
Answer: Yeah. I think in in connection with the with the daily question we were confronted
with...how do we survive, because once a asked me I should tell him something about the
art of survival, and the answer is their is no art, so I will...in Auschwitz it was an accident, or a
chance. Uh certainly you had to have the the will to survive and I must say after the first couple of
weeks or months, where very often I was confronted with the question, will I be able to make it, or
should I rather uh uh uh put an end to my life in order to be liberated from the misery, but then after
one year or so when I got the better job and could work as a welder, and also was able to uh to uh
get some additional food here and there for certain activities, for instance, when I was was uh
appointed a bed-maker and and also when I was appointed to be the secretary of the block in order
to keep the records, that gave me a chance uh then to to uh somehow keep myself cleaner and and
uh also to...my my I would say was was strengthened by by by that...
Question: How did you...can you tell me about becoming...how did it happen that you became the
secretary of the block?

Answer: Well, uh because I I I helped out to a certain extent to uh to uh to uh...for instance, when
there was...when food was distributed, you know, there was a certain order had to had to be
established. I was able with my school French, for instance, to speak to the Greek prisoners, people
from Greek who spoke only Greek and French. That was...or or or Latino (ph). Latino certainly I
didn't know, but my French was good enough to communicate with them, or also with the people
from other countries in order so that that uh ___I_ was trying to help and then obviously the
secretary uh uh who was doing the work before left, so I was asked to do it and and I accepted it
gladly because uh I didn't become an officer of the of the barrack, but at least it gave me a certain
chance to to to improve, which was...improve, you know, and and and and uh whatever improve
means, you know...conditions somehow. Uh so therefore as I say, the the the uh the chance to to
survive, the chance that, call it that on the morning you didn't know if the evening would be yours or
in the evening when you went to bed, not to be sure that the next morning you were still
alive...somehow tured more into the positive angle. You wanted to survive. You wanted uh to to
to survive and and reach a normal world again, at least that was my feeling to, as
formulated it once, to tell the tale, to tell the world this is...and and and beware of it that it should
never happen again, and there were many, many facets of that. I think I told you last time, for
instance, about the role the British prisoners of war played to help to strengthen our morale uh and
when they came, they gave us courage. Uh uh I had...I think this we covered already...I had the
good fortune to begin...to become their friends, so they shared the news with me which they got
illegally with their receiver, so we knew that certainly the war for Germany was lost and especially
after the second front had been established in France, that it was only a matter of time, and the
question only was, would we be able to hold out that long and certainly we knew that the Germans

uh were were loosing at the eastern front and every day was another step uh uh uh and one day
hopefully the eastern front would would reach us, because we were in the eastern part of...located in
the eastern part of Europe. Uh the...that was one of the things in which the British were so helpful,
and also to provide food and and support directly uh and I was also the beneficiary of many of their
good deeds and I'll never forget about it. One of the things which interesting was that one day a
fellow who came...he was from India because his father was a sheriff in India in the British
administration. He had never seen England and when we talked, I could tell him a little bit about
my experience in London and so we exchanged views and so we became friends. And he told me
then one day...and then as...since our life was such a peculiar kind of life, without papers, without
books, without...with hungry for for for some spiritual food also. Uh he told me somehow that he
has gotten something from I don't which...an organization in Boston, and I asked him, do you have
contact with Boston. He said sure, through my military mail I have. He said I have an idea. Could
you eventually try to establish contact for me with my friend...with friends I have in America, in the
United States. The address I knew by heart...you know, we had no address book anymore, but my
memory, thank God, was good enough. He said sure I will, so I formulated for him a letter in which
he said I met Norbert here. He is alright. He is fine. He doesn't know anything. He doesn't know
where his family is right now. I mean we had to be very careful and he hopes one day to be able to
see you again, so this letter he sent out, and it reached my friends, probably after months or so and
uh in the closing days of Auschwitz...I think it was already in December when when most of the
industrial area was was badly, badly smashed and destroyed...he was...all of a sudden came running
and he said I have good news for you. I said what was it, another uh big uh big uh victory on the on
the western or eastern front. He said no, but believe it or not I got a letter back from your friends.
Now this was something which Auschwitz hadn't seen before, and I couldn't believe it so I was so

excited I I ran to the toilet house in in the area where we were working. Uh the man who was in
charge of that was also an inmate and I said, listen, close all the doors and I give you...I don't know
how much I have or not have...I have to read this letter. And I read from my friends who obviously
did not quite understand what was going on. How could they? Uh said well, I'm glad to hear about
Norbert. Just assure him when you see him again that we are the same friends we were, because we
were friends from the youth movement, that when the war is over, he should come and be with us
and and and and and uh uh he uh he should be of good..good courage and so on. So when I told this
my very close friends, nobody could believe it, so I had the fortitude to bring this letter and to
smuggle this letter with me into the camp, which was terribly dangerous certainly, but I wanted to
show them also to give them some kind of courage. There is still...you see, can see even from
Auschwitz, from behind the barbed wire, there is a connection you can establish with people in
America, and uh then I came to this count...to America in '46 on a visit. Uh I saw my friends in
Decateur (ph), Michigan. They had a farm there and uh uh I asked for that letter because I wanted
to to make it part of my museum, and they said uh no, they will never give it away, because...but
what they...at this time when they got the letter, they were completely puzzled. They said, for
goodness sake how can he be...they didn't certainly know which location it was because it was a
military number under which it was sent...how could it be he is a British prisoner of war. What
happened to him, so they were completely flabbergasted until I explained it to him, to them and they
they they got aware uh that actually that this was something in which a British prisoner of war
became call it the conduit for a message to America, and I must say this gave me a tremendous lift
up and and and and and uh I told some of my friends. Uh he could hardly believe it, but this is what
you could do with the British because there was this solidarity of man. They understood you. And
they didn't accept any kind of anti-Semitism or racism amongst them, because for them the Nazis

were not only enemies on a military uh basis but also certainly on a political and moral basis I
would say. That was one of the things uh I certainly have never forgotten. There was also...I want
to emphasize, there were other ways of spiritual resistance, to uh to uh nourish us spiritually. I think
I talked about the service. But uh a typical example uh how how how spi...spiritual resistance can
work is this example which I've cited very often. I met in Auschwitz uh very early at my arrival, an
elderly man. He originated from somewhere in Galatia (ph), had served during World War I in the
Austrian army, and uh after the war, after World War I, he had made his way to Berlin, had
established some existence as a cobbler, had married, uh had a nice family, and with a so-called
Polish ar...with a Polish accent, in September 1939 and he had been taken a prisoner and and and
was shifted from Buchenwald to Saxonhausen, from Saxonhausen to Auschwitz, and so so he had,
when I met him, already he had spent quite some years behind the barbed wire. He was a won...a
simple man, uh a pious man, very religious in spite of everything, in spite of everything, and he said
his his prayers every day and he always when when things were were difficult, he gave us certain
quotations from whatever he had to to say well, uh they cannot succeed. Uh we were stronger in
spirit than they. One day...it was uh uh in fall I think of '44...whenever it was, the weather was
terrible. There was...it was a rainy day and the winds come blowing down from the
Mountains and we were standing for a roll call uh and it lasted and lasted because something
was...went wrong, had gone wrong with the figures, and the the people there were not too good with
figures, but if it didn't tie in properly they...you, you couldn't couldn't be released so we were
standing there and and and it was...really, it was horror. People fainted and and and couldn't take it
but nevertheless uh it went on so uh the the the moments in your life and I would seconds are
minutes and minutes are hours and hours are years, and I was standing in my formation, you know,
at fives, next to this friend and I noticed that he was praying and asked him, I said ___, what are

you doing. He said as you can see I'm praying. I said but I'm certain you said your morning prayers
and for the (cough) evening prayers, I said it's too early, so uh what are you praying for. He said,
well, I'm not praying not the morning prayers, not the afternoon, not the evening prayers. I'll sing a
special prayer to God. I said what are your praying for. He said I'm thanking God, and I always
was bewildered. I said __, thanking for what, for that misery we are in, for the for the terrible
situation, for being forsaken here by God. He said you don't understand. I am thanking for God,
God for one thing...that he didn't make me like them, the murderers around me. Uh and interesting
enough, a couple of months later uh we had to undergo one of these infamous uh selections. That
means when there were too many people especially in the uh in the in the hospital, uh then the
_____ and the SS came to the conclusion that they should uh uh...that those who cannot or were
were too long in the hospital just should be exterminated, because they they were not worth uh uh to
be fed anymore and and they had become, in their opinion, a nuisance. So uh this friend of mine
certainly was an elderly man and had grey hair, hair...you can about grayish...and we were afraid
that uh the selection would have would would would uh be his end, so two or three friends...I was
already a schriber (ph), a secretary...uh came to the conclusion something has to be done. Now in
connection with that selection I also, since I was the secretary I changed the dates, the birth dates,
because there was not...we didn't have any ink, just pencils, so pencil you can erase easily so I
changed some of the dates, especially of elderly people, hopefully to to save them, so and the
selections happened in this way that you have to line up in a...and and people have to pass an SS
man and he would then say, like like Mengele...left, right, left, right. In other words, to die or to
live, to continue to live. And in order to save this man from this from this experience, we came to
the conclusion that there was only one way out...that means to hide him in these straw sacks which
were also called mattresses, even if there was a danger that he would suffocate but at least it was

seen the only way to do it, and he was an an old uh camp man and he knew all the tricks and so he
said yes, I I'm willing to undergo this risk, so that's what we did. We put him into the the mattress,
covered him with straw and when the selection went on, somebody else went from for him and uh
uh when they also checked the the the barracks, didn't find him in the in the in the mattress, so he
luckily survived and he survived also the the end of the war and just two or three years ago he uh he
uh died in New York at the blessed age of ninety-two. There's another interesting uh uh facet of this
which uh has also uh described in his book, —__.- Uh it was I think already I think in the
fall of 1944. We all had the feeling it's a matter of time because we were aware of the events, the
the military events and uh the the second front had been established and the the Allied troops were
already deep in France, so three of our uh uh our comrades who were old-timers, who were already
there for years, had come to the conclusion that since you never know what would they let
us...would they let us live to see the day of liberation or not, had uh decided they want to try to
escape, which was not an easy task because uh first of all so many barbed wires around the camp
but also uh you can never...could never be sure of the population uh around Auschwitz, whether
they wanted to cooperate with the Germans or not, but they said we'll risk our lives. We never
know what what the end will be, and obviously uh in the middle of their preparations, uh somebody
had discovered that. Up to now we don't know exactly who it was, and uh uh certainly the uh the uh
the uh the uh punishment and the penalty for that was death. Now the SS gangsters in Auschwitz as
in any other concentration camp, made a cruel spectacle out of that because they executed people by
hanging in public, and we all had to stand there and watch and at the end we had to to uh march by
and and and see that that this was uh the..that was the penalty meted out for anybody who would
dare to escape, so one...and we didn't know for many many weeks, we didn't know what would the
destiny be, because many attempts were made to to save them, but uh uh uh Berlin...1 mean the

death sentence was usually confirmed by by ___, by the by the Gestapo, by the uh uh by
Himmler's (ph) office in in Berlin, and then one day when we mar...came back from work, we saw
the gallows uh uh erected at the square where we had our our our roll call, and we knew that uh that
uh...we didn't know exactly what we saw...three gallows awaiting there, and then we got aware that
these were these three friends who uh who uh obviously uh uh the order was...who who could not
be saved and uh we all had to stand there at attention and the atmosphere was terribly tense because
most of us knew them, appreciated them, loved them, knew about their courage and their dedication
for fellow, for fellow inmates, so we were absolutely down and depressed, and then the spectacle
began. They were led to the gallows and then one of the SS gangsters read the so-called death
sentence, which was confirmed by Berlin that because of their attempt to flee they have been...the
Reichsfuhrer (ph) Himmler has decided that they should be put to death, and when they were under
the gallows and the ropes already around them, one of the three...by the way uh uh one of them is
the brother of our friend Freddie who is very active in our affairs in in California. One of
them all of a sudden penetrated this deadly silence with a voice which could be heard all over the
the place and he said it in German. I will translate it ina moment. He said to...or he he cried out uh

, which means, comrades, keep your highs heads...keep your heads high. We
will be the last, which means let uh...liberation is on the march, and certainly we will not live to see
the day of liberation anymore but you will. And for a moment when this happened we thought that
the SS uh standing on their towers, on the watch towers with machine guns and so on, the other
guards uh armed to their teeth, would open a blood bath and so but this didn't happen, but you could
see that they didn't feel good about it but it had a tremendous effect on all of us, and though it is now
uh uh more than uh uh forty-five years after that, we are still speaking about it, still uh uh asking
ourselves the question what gave them this strength, knowing that they would meet their maker in in

minutes, uh to tell us don't worry about us, but you will have the uh the the the chance to see
hopefully the other world waiting beyond the the barbed wire. So uh uh you see, and this this is this
is this is uh just amongst the many things we we know from that time, proof that uh phys...spiritual
resistance had remained in spite of the fact, and I can say for myself also personally, to say that
well, they tried to make us a number but they will never convert us into a number. So this this this
was, as I say, it was already at a time when when when when uh the air, the political air was was so
different. People still died uh daily. There was still enough victims unfortunately, but when it came
uh to this time, uh uh uh there...it it...the whole, the whole atmosphere had changed when
particularly when certainly was that you could feel slowly also the military effect of the advances of
the of the advance of the Allies in the east and the west. In uh...I think it was in in August, early in
August, we saw from from our places in the factory and the camp, we saw our first major attack by
the American air force uh uh stationed at this time in Italy, coming from Italy. They had attained
almost completely already supremacy in the air and they uh uh...I think it was early in August
attackedarefineryin__I think is the name, and for days we saw the black smoke covering the
whole area, so we we thought for ourselves, well one day they must come and and also try to hit this
factory which did not produce yet but was very close to completion and sure enough, on on August
20th, 1944...it was a Sunday...the American air force uh to attack the = ————suh_-uh combine...uh
area in Auschwitz. Uh J at this time...at this day was working in the camp to to do some some uh uh
paperwork, but I knew that many of my friends were outside in the factory and were certainly
concerned. Uh it was an attack which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes and uh what they did, they
they hit the the factory uh uh to such an extent that that uh it threw them back for years in our
opinion, but also we lost on that day approximately eighty people of our own uh which we said
well, this is the price we have to pay, or as the French would say, la guerre comme a la guerre

(ph)...that is the price. Uh one bomb, interesting enough, also by mistake uh uh went down in our
own camp, which is outside of the factory...which was outside of the factory. Didn't do any
damage, but another bomb by mistake hit the British prisoners of war. They were sitting outside of
some kind of a trench and uh uh forty of of those people were killed. They were playing
gramophone (ph) music because they liked it so much to see the the the ___ but then the bomb
unfortunately hit, and amongst them was also a nice friend of mine, a man whom I befriended who
who originated from London, but also the British said well, that's it. That's the price we have to pay.
Uh this is when we...when we went into action in Africa. We knew that that something like this
could happen so that was it. What we...what what uh we thought after this, after this experience was
why don't they come also to to uh hit the railways leading to Auschwitz. We didn't know at this
time that, for instance, Jewish leaders were storming the chancellories in London and in Washington
uh uh to do something like that and certainly we we didn't know that there was a letter then
written...I think under the signature of the then Assistant Secretary of the Army John McL
saying that uh uh the uh governments have to concentrate on the completion of the war and also
they are afraid and this is the the wording, that if something would be done in the interest of the
prisoners, the Nazis could become more vindi...vindictive towards the prisoners. Well uh uh...
Question: How did you feel when day by day went by and they did not bomb the railroad lines?
Answer: I couldn't understand that. I couldn't understand that. Uh as I say, this question came up
more after the war when I asked the people what...we we...on the other hand, peculiar as it may
sound, we were so glad to see them because we were...when the attack came, for instance,

, the only protection we had was outside in trenches where you could see these hundreds

and hundreds of fortresses, of flying fortresses, coming and and and and there was hardly any anti-
craft fire from from the Germans. Certainly our people, many of our people were were crying and
so and and praying, and my reaction was, I said be happy uh to see them because you might have
relatives sitting in the cockpit, you know, and and doing this work in our interest, and certainly you
had to reckon that you could be also amongst the targets, but this is...in war, you know, you you you
unfortunately you don't know where it hits. Uh so after the first event in August, after that very
effective attack, we were put to work immediately to try to uh undo the damage, because they
wanted...they had a certain date...I don't know which...to uh to uh uh not to start production but to
uh to also to get into production somehow, and I think the day before the deadline, the the bombers
came again with another attack and then uh the next uh day, the next target to to have the repair, the
damage repaired was I think the day after Christmas, and sure enough on Christmas they came
again, and they smashed the factory to smitherings and to such extent that nothing could be done
anymore and there was...then the the morale I would say broke in this respect that they said there's
nothing to be done anymore, so we were just trying to play around and play for time if possible.
Also uh then realizing especially in December that the Russian front had become very close. We
knew that _ had been taken and that that certainly that they came pretty close, the Russian army
close to Krackow, and uh then uh uh in the course of the military events, in January when the uh
Russians started their offensive across the __I think, and uh reached Krackow...Krackow was
only, I think, sixty kilometers from Auschwitz in the east, then a day before that uh uh the order
came not to wal...not to march out any more to the factory, and the question was what's going to
happen, because certainly uh uh without knowing the uh the uh the uh thinking of the of these SS
gangsters properly, what are they going to do with us, it was touch and go. Would they dynamite
the camp and then blow us up or whatever it is...so we spent that day uh more or less in in tension.

What I had done in case they they should drive us out, I had put on my my British underwear and
my British boots I had kept available in so in case we we were we were driven out, and sure
enough...

Question: Excuse me. I'm going to pause because I want to know where did you get British
underwear and British boots?

Answer: From my friends, from the British soldiers, you know. They had enough stuff and part of
it...as I say I was one of their benefactors and they gave me what...not only certain things I hadn't
seen for years like chocolate and once in a while cigarettes which I didn't smoke, but gave away, but
they...when I told them that and we talked about...they had wonderful stuff, uh uh which they got
from the International Red Cross, that certain underwear and also I had a pair of shoes I I could call
it organize from them, and they were very generous and very gracious to me. I might owe the the
British treasury something for that. I don't know, but uh anyhow that's what it what it was, and uh
yes...on August 18th, uh somehow we heard that the the Russians had uh uh broken through the
German lines, had uh entered Krackow. We saw on the on the road adjacent to our camp, we saw
already all these trucks, the German military trucks and tanks and so passing by, but in the direction
towards the west, so they were fleeing. And uh the question was will the Russians uh liberate us or
what's going to happen, and then uh on August 18th, uh in the middle of the day, the order came
that we had to be ready by four o'clock. We didn't know what...I1 mean we had no watches so it
was...four o'clock was on their time. Everybody had to be ready to uh to walk out with the
exception of those people in the in the uh uh hospital who couldn't walk, and we were certain that
uh they would be killed there because they wouldn't let them fall into the hands of the Russian army,

of the Red army, and also we saw the day before by the way, that a lot obviously of papers uh uh
had been burned, so the SS got already uh marching order with the with the with the order also to
take care of papers which could be could be uh uh used against them, and then on the 18th in the
afternoon we walked out and also the the the women of the of the brothel walked out and it was
approximate...it was a a terrible wintry day, approximately we heard this...it was minus eighteen
centigrades, which I think is less than zero fahrenheit. There were the icy streets on which we
walked, and that was the first time that I saw again the outside there. The uh guards were very, very
tense and afraid because they were they were deadly afraid that the Russians would overtake them
and certainly uh being in an SS uniform was not...they knew it would not be very helpful for them.
We uh...whatever we had, I mean we had a little bit of bread and that was...a little bit of...I don't
know...margarine. That's all we could...we had to...that was for the whole the whole time, we could
carry, and uh we were...as I said we walked and marched, so called marching order and very soon
on account of the weather and so people people dropped left and right, and if they did were shot
at...on the spot. Some, interesting enough, especially of Polish people, non-Jews (cough) who knew
that eventually or who hoped that the population around Auschwitz would help them, tried to escape
into the woods, which during the night was was was daring but still most of them were successful
because all all the shooting didn't help because most of the bullets hit the trees and not the people
who had who had escaped, but for us there was there was no choice. We walked all night. We
walked and and, interesting enough, we we saw, we heard the guns blazing. We saw the fire shine
of the of the guns and any time we hoped that the front would come...would would be faster than we
were but was hope against hope. Uh there was a bridge to be made over the __— which was aa
river near Auschwitz, and after the _, after we after we had passed the __, the SS guards
became a little bit more relaxed because they were afraid that the bridge would be blown up before

and they couldn't make it to the other side anymore. The whole night we were walking and he who
couldn't make it, that was the end. And we walked part of the other day and then reached a place uh
in called Nicholai (ph) I remember where you had a a a brick factory and they drove us into that and
wherever we could find a place to sleep or to stand and and we spent some time of rest and then we
were driven out again in the direction towards Germany, and after another day or so and a night
again, we reached a camp near the city of Leipzig (ph). Uh the people there in Leipzig had left
already the camp and uh certainly also...by the way the SS (cough) __ certain travel because
whatever they carried, they couldn't carry so long because there was not enough there was not
enough moving material in order to to to uh to to...so they had to leave certain of their of their of
their of their goods they had acquired in Auschwitz, they had to leave there on the road, and in
Leipzig we spent uh a night, a day. Then they march us out again and we are told we will be on the
way to uh another camp called Gross Rosen. Uh during the night there were heavy, heavy air raids
and obviously fights but uh the front did not reach us. We walked towards Gross Rosen which
would have been approximately a hundred fifty or two hundred kilometers or a hundred fifty miles,
but then in the mid...we were hardly out of town when we were told we cannot use that road
because uh for military reasons, so we went back into our camp and thought that would be it. It was
not, so the next day uh uh we were taken to a to a railway station, to a freight railway station, and
there were in spite of all the military uh uh uh situa...in spite of the military situation, the Germans
did not...had still been able to pro...to make a freight train ready for us and we were all loaded on
open cattle cars, open cars, approximately one hundred, hundred twenty in one car...I don't know
(clearing throat) ..-understand (clearing throat) they were counting us before we left, and we were
approximately six thousand on that train. The train uh then uh...completely exposed to the
elements. No food, no nothing, so uh and we started to travel and then noticed that we are traveling

towards Czechoslovakia and uh across the border I think, and it was on an afternoon
when we reached the the uh the area of Vitkovitch (ph), which is an industrial area in in Salasia
(ph), which is already in Czechoslovakia. Uh Vitkovitch was a a was a big a big...tremendous iron
works, uh still working, still in production obviously, and we were halting there in in a station for a
certain while uh and the people saw and and and this was probably just when there was some shift
of the workers and when the workers saw what was going on, they took their packages with
sandwiches or whatever they had and threw it into our wagons in order to to show us their solidarity
and to help us somehow because it was not only hunger but thirst which was which was uh uh uh
really giving us trouble. We saw women uh uh falling down on their knees in prayer. The SS was
shooting uh mostly into the air luckily, but the people, these Czechoslovakians, they didn't budge.
Whatever they had they gave us and that was really...that was heartwarming. Though we were in
let's say in very bad shape, to such extent and the train left then. People started to die, to collapse
and to die. We didn't know what to do with them because there was hardly room for us to stand,
certainly not to sit and uh so then some of the...especially where there were quite a number of
German crim...criminal...criminals and so amongst them said well, the only way is to throw them
out of the the wagons, and that was done. And uh when this...the the car...the the train was certainly
accompanied by SS guards and led by two uh commissioned officers, one with the name of uh Mull
(ph) who interesting enough was the man who was in charge of the gas chamber operations in
Birkenau. (Clearing throat) The other with the name of Ruggers (ph) who was the the uh
Kommandofurher (ph) we called him, in other words in charge of the SS on the factory area in in
Auschwitz in . Then all of a sudden the uh order came not to throw any any corpses out
anymore but to wait for the next stop in order to collect them because obviously the uh the uh the
uh...it had to became...become known that on that way of the train uh corpses are lying left and right

and uh they were they were concerned somehow, the Nazis, about the effect of that. So one place
uh where we stopped uh uh the corpses were were taken down and then these SS gangsters Mull
and Ruggers came and said well, uh since we have the corpses give us also the mussulmen now,
which means mussulmen are the people who uh almost ready to die but were not dead yet. Uh uh I
must say to the honor of my Jewish uh fellow inmates we refused that, but some of these uh uh
German criminals said alright and uh there was nothing...we couldn't stop that, so what they did
then was uh uh brought these mussulmen down and then both of them, Mull and Ruggers, took their
pistols and shot them uh uh on the spot. Uh what happened later with Mull we don't know.
Probably he disappeared or was taken by the Russians and so Ruggers was discovered after the war
uh and was tried in the in the courtin__—_ and I was one of the witnesses against him. Uh uh he
uh pretended that he didn't shoot and he didn't...and the court was very tough and rigid with me to
that I really knew that the people were still alive when they were shot and so on, but the whole the
whole uh uh court procedure in my opinion, though it was a German court, ..it Was a
farce. The uh the president of that court was a was himself a political, political persecutee but who
was afraid of his own shadow and and and (cough) I think uh Ruggers was sent to jail for fifteen
years, whatever, for murder. That that was all. So much probably he is now walking the streets of
Germany if he if he is still around. Now then the uh the uh the uh train continued its way to uh to
uh via Czechoslovakia and wherever we stopped and the people again tried to help, especially we
were terribly thirsty. Thirst is worst than hunger. Luckily there was snow around so so we could
have...we could also wash with snow so that...uh uh and then we left Czechoslovakia and got into
Austria. There was nobody to help us anymore. Nobody to ask...even when we asked for for for
some snow or for some water, there was no...no no no positive reaction, and we were taken to a to
one station uh next to the camp of Mauthausen and we were there for two or for two or three days

and nothing happened. Still standing there, trying to sleep and standing. There was hardly food or
they they threw some bread into the wagons but but it was very difficult to grab it so...and I must
say this was this was something which which uh was was then in history it's now called...it's a death
march, which affected me very, very deeply and I know I had some kind of visions uh not so much
to food but but to to be somehow to be under a roof, not to be exposed to to the snow and to the
elements and to take a bath, a hot bath, and to sleep somewhere, but to sleep, sleep and and forget
about everything else. Two days after having having waited in Mauthausen, we were told
Mauthausen were filled. They cannot accept us, so they took the same train, brought us back uh
through Czechoslovakia and took us to Germany and we crossed the border into Germany uh at
place which I knew because uh I was hiking there. Also I had spent some some some vacationing
there in the mountains. It's a beautiful spot called the Swiss they call... ,
Switzerland. They crossed the border but via Dresden (ph). Dresden was still
perfectly alright at this time. It was January after all. We left the the...I, as I told you, on 18th of
January we got out of of uh Auschwitz and this was in the second half or last half of January, so as I
say, Dresden was still alright and they took us and I was familiar with that with that uh uh route
because I had traveled on that before between Berlin and Dresden. They took us to Berlin and uh
then I saw Berlin again for the first time, and it was already in very bad shape and interesting
enough, our train passed by one of the stations uh from which I had to leave when I went to work
during the Nazi time in the morning. I was absolutely numb uh uh cold and the hunger and the
thirst and so it it had affected me and but when they said we're at Berlin, I was sure that this would
be the place, uh Saxonhausen-Orianenburg. And this is where they actually took us. A friend of
mine who was on a wagon next to me uh because he couldn't manage to be with me, was in bad
shape and just when when we were already on the way between Dresden and Berlin, somebody

yelled to me and said...his name was Bruno and he was...he came to Auschwitz almost at the same
time I had been...Bruno had just uh uh uh perished this morning. He is dead, and interesting
enough, his parents were still living in Berlin because his father was married to a non-Jewess and
and she saved him in Berlin, but on the way from Dresden to Berlin he perished. Then we were
taken to a to a to uh Saxonhausen to a placed called ___ and were asked to descend the...we could
hardly walk down because we didn't move for days and days. We arrived there, I think it was on
January 31st. We were on the train almost ten or seven days. As I told you uh when we left
Leipzig, the roll call was approximately six thousand. When we came to uh Orianenburg, only two
thousand had remained. All the others had perished...hunger, starvation, tried to escape, and so on.
And when we came to that place, interesting enough, that was not directly the main camp but it was
like uh uh uh auxiliary camp which they had established within an airplane factory called
ee is a famous brand in in German aircraft building, but there was no no windows left
anymore. It was already also in bad shape and we uh we were directed to that place there. Uh you
couldn't warm up because there was no heat and the windows, as I said, were were were smashed,
so the first two or three nights we were sleeping on on the cement floor which was not very healthy
and...but we got we got something to drink, at least something...I don't know what to eat.
Interesting enough, uh some of the prisoners were Polish uh criminals. They knew what was
coming on. They said well, you can have a glass of water. Give me a gold watch or something like
that because they still expected that people had taken certain of the riches from Auschwitz uh to uh
to that train. Uh then uh some of the people who had reached Saxonhausen were taken on another
transport going to southern Germany. I managed to stay there and again I was lucky. Uh I was uh
I...lucky for one specific reason. Uh I didn't have a chance certainly to shave myself during all these
days onthe _, but one of the first things with the help of snow was that I shaved and when...

Question: Where did you get a razor?

Answer: I still had it from the...also from the British. (laughter) ____—.~-A razor and some soap,
what...was whatever I had, but I I tried to to to at least to shave, and then came...they came from the
from the from the kommando and said we need people who are able to type, so I said yes, I am able
to type and since I looked clean and shaven, I II had the good fortune to be taken there into into the
uh what they call kommando stuben (ph). They were mainly non-Jewish prisoners and there they
were not too badly off. They had food...uh uh some reserves of food, some soup and they offered
us...uh there were two who had been selected for that job, and uh they offered us whatever they
could and uh we really felt good for the first time to be in a really warm room and to to to eat and to
fill our stomach and interesting enough when they asked us about where do you come from and so
we told them Auschwitz...they knew very, very little about Auschwitz. We had to tell them all
about Auschwitz. They were old, old inmates, old helflings, but had hardly any knowledge what
Auschwitz was. And so I say I I I was lucky that I L...we worked mostly uh mainly lists had to be
prepared...I don't know what, and we were typing but then don't forget it was near Berlin, so air raid
warnings came almost every night so when air raid warnings came, we couldn't work so at least
caught up somehow with my sleep and there I recovered slowly somehow and was assigned to a to
a barrack where where I could at least find also a clean place and this this kind of worked and uh
tried to establish some some some contacts uh uh especially with the wonderful people from
Denmark who were also uh uh kept as prisoners there and Norway. These were mainly students or
policemen who had tried to protest against the German oppressors in Denmark and in Norway and
had then become prisoners and they were taken to the concentration camps and landed in

Saxonhausen-Orianenburg, and these are people with a wonderful morale and . We
knew it was only a couple of days. They said alright but what will will happen to us, and one of
them gave meavery _._ Said first of all try to uh to uh be become part of us, of the political
prisoners and and but if they come and want you to shave your hair, don't allow that. Say you are a
political prisoner. You speak German like any other Germans, so try that and try to advise also your
fellow...especially those who know German well, to somehow mix with us because uh the order
anyhow is breaking down here slowly but surely so this is the way, one of the way, hopefully way
you can save your life. Then interesting enough the Norwegians but especially the Danes, in
March, I think, early in April were taken out under the so-called Bernadotte (ph) Aktion, which
means uh Count Bernadotte who was the head of the Swedish Red Cross and who had contacts with
either the National Red Cross or the German Red Cross, had arranged that the people, especially the
these political pris...I think it was an arrangement he had with Himmler, that they should be taken
out and should be returned and that's what they did. Uh so still we we we're there in Saxonhausen.
We we...at least I did not did not strain myself too much anymore. There was not...some of our
people unfortunately had still to work in a factory, a brick factory where they did some nonsensical,
heavy work. Also uh food was...became short. There was, for instance, salt became very short
because they needed it for chemical purposes, the salt. But there was one terrific advantage. This
camp had a radio, interesting enough, for the for the whole camp and when they were playing music
or whatever, this sometimes it was interrupted...I remember that one evening somebody broke into
the music and said here's Frankfurt, the the occupational radio of the American army or something
like that. This certainly gave us a tremendous hope. We knew when when it came close to March,
April ___ the weather luckily became became uh warmer, still the the...there was another...spring is
always that time where you exert your__—.-~-You you want to be alive.

Question: OK. At this point...excuse me...we want to stop. We're going to pause and change tapes.
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
END OF TAPE 5
Question: OK. Uh we're on tape. You are in Saxonhausen...and can you just repeat it...
Answer: On that that uh we we were coming and we knew...we saw, for instance, a lot of air
activities, also air fights. I remember when one uh uh fighter plane was was I think following a
German fighter and shot him down. That was a terribly an atrocious moment when this came down
and exploded, not far from us uh so we saw already that the war came came closer. It was April,
after all.
Question: And you were in...tell us the camp?
Answer: That was in Saxonhausen which was...which was approximately twenty to thirty
kilometers north of Berlin. Now since...we we didn't know all the details but we knew that the
American army had penetrated Germany uh uh deeply and that the Russians uh had had uh at least
uh reached the uh the uh River, so the question again came up, what's going to happen and
since we didn't know by whom would...we thought that the the Nazis now had enough of us and
what would either kill us or or leave us alone, but no. They they still had to...they they treated us

like cattle (ph) till the very last moment, and we uh we uh uh knew...we knew then that the Russians
had had made...were marching towards towards Berlin and on April 20th...that's that's Hitler's
birthday...we uh uh saw in Saxonhausen an air attack going towards Berlin uh uh of a dimension I
have...I had not seen in Auschwitz and I didn't believe was possible. The air was...there were not
only hundreds...there must have been thousands, and since it was a clear day, a beautiful day, the air
there was filled with...it looked like sheet music in the air because of the of the the evaporating
trails, and they went towards Berlin. How Berlin could survive under those circumstances, we were
not quite clear, but they didn't____ Berlin. One bomb, interesting enough, also fell into our camp
and luckily hit the munitions depot, so we when...then then we said to ourselves, those bullets
exploding cannot do any harm to us anymore. When this was over...and it lasted a long time...and
by the way, we had no shelter, no nothing, so we could see it but on the other hand it was interesting
to to to to to watch it, but when this was over, after hours, there was no water. There was no
electricity, but what for us was very important to know that no electricity in the in the in the barbed
wire, so we thought and we had amongst ourselves days before spoken about some tentative
committees we should build. Those who were able to speak English and French, in case the the the
uh especially the Allies should reach us first, and those who are__ Polish and Russian, uh uh for
in case the Russian army should, because we were certain that they would uh enter Saxonhausen in
in the course of the military operations. It was not to happen. On that same night...and as I say
there was no light, no water, no nothing...I heard this...I still remember...I had...1 couldn't sleep too
well...a courier came from the kommando, from the from the main headquarters saying the camp,
the whole camp has to be ready to march out at six o'clock in the morning, which means that they
they put us on the march again. In connection with preparations, I had acquired a jacket, a civilian
jacket, without stripes and also pants without stripes, but you know, in the back of the jacket there

was a still a sign which characterized me as an inmate, so what I I...at this moment when I had then
decided I'll I'll throw away the uh the uh other the uh the prison garb, took the pants and this jacket
but covered me with a with a coat, which was...had still striped coat and uh uh my my cap, which I
have with me. If you want to see for a moment...

Question: Later...no, we'll do it later, OK?

Answer: So we walked out and interesting enough, we saw already the German army in defeat.
They were...we walked in towards the woods surrounding Saxonhausen, we saw that uh army
trucks and and and uh uh tanks and uh uh troop carriers had taken cover in these in these woods.
We saw women for the first time. We hadn't seen women for for weeks and weeks. And we saw,
interesting enough, also German refugees who obviously were running away from from the front
because what had happened was that the Russians...uh and we didn't know that they were supposed
to take Berlin, that under the agreement they had with the Allies, the Allies and Americans were
were to stop at the __, not to advance, but that the Russians would surround would surround
Berlin and take it. Uh that...in in the course of that operation, refugees had taken to the road, also to
flee to the north with the hope to meet the Allies because they thought that when they meet the
Allies they would be better off than to meet the Russians. So we walked uh towards the north, not
knowing where, not knowing why, not knowing what the purpose was, but still under guard and uh
interesting enough, the the the what the Nazis then did was that they had taken some of the German
pris...uh inmates, especially criminals, and put them into into into SS uniform, so we were walking
and uh during the night uh sleeping in the woods. Thank God I was a Boy Scout. I knew how to
build...uh we had some blankets in order to protect yourself and also to come as close as possible,

because the nights were still pretty cool...it was April after all...so we walked uh quite some
stretches for a couple of days. We saw (cough)...excuse me...more and more refugees. We did not
know what the military situation was certainly, because we were cut off. Then uh uh we...we knew
that this... my geography was good enough for that that I knew we were walking out of the province
of Brandenburg (ph) towards Meklenburg (ph) somehow, to the north, and then uh we passed by,
interesting enough, one stretch where we saw a terrible picture of uh dead horses and corpses and
and and uh destruction because in the night before American fliers had had uh uh uh , they
called it, had strafed the area and since there were also military groups, military columns marching
and walking, they certainly from the height couldn't see that also refugees were there, so there were
quite a number of casualties. The advantage was that uh dead horses became a source of supply,
especially for the French who knew very well how to get to the liver or so in order to to get some
meat out which they could use uh because we
had no, no other...the little of food we took with us was was used up very soon.
Question: So what you're saying is you were able to use some of the horse meat yourselves?
Answer: Not at the beginning. I mean we were...I was very reluc...we...[ mean we didn't believe
that that...but you know, when hunger is striking you, you know, you don't ask any more.
Question: When did you finally and where meet up with the Allies?
Answer: I'll tell you. We uh uh uh were driven for quite a number...we drove out on the 20th, and
we were walking approximately uh ten or twelve days already, uh stopping in one big forest,

almost...it was just on the day of my birthday I remember, on the April 26th, we were somewhere in
a place, in a beautiful area but uh and the question came up should we try to escape, but uh here
again the question was uh uh to which extent could you rely on the German population.

Question: OK. So this...explain something, if you would, because I...it was a little unclear. You
were still then under guard?

Answer: Still under guard. They were still shooting if anybody is tried to get away and we were
still...though we were...from the air we were bombarded, but also the guards were still there. The
guards uh uh were not very happy about this because they were also afraid of their lives, especially
that that they would be subjected to attacks. After twelve days I think, we were driven to a point
where it was was...all this area is is forest area, at least it was at this time, and when we were
walking...a real pretty week I must say...I had some of my friends still with me, not to loose contact
with them. Uh all of a sudden a bicyclist, a motor bicyclist, a German with a bicyclist came and
said to the to the SS guards there, idiots, where are you going. The Americans are already in,
and when we heard this, we became alert, because we knew from the signs there that __— could
only be what fifty or sixty, seventy miles...uh kilometers away, so were ordered into a into a forest
there to stay there for the night and a friend of mine with whom I was together from Auschwitz all
the time, he had the courage to take some horse...to to get some horse meat and we were trying to
make a fire in order to cook it which was not easy because it was pretty wet in this this forest, and
we were in the middle of preparations in order to get something to eat when all of a sudden from the
back of us, obviously the Russians opened up with heavy guns. Now you have to understand we

later realized that we were walking into some kind of a military pocket...the Russians in the back of
us and the Allied armies in front of us, and uh in the middle of the night it was...no, not middle...it it
it was just getting dark...the Russian guns really uh sent their shells and they came they came closer
and closer, and almost threatening and at this moment I said to my friend...we...[ saw some of the
Polish people, Polish political prisoners we had in our area, said well, this enough, we run. And I
said to my friend, I think this is also the time for us to run, so we left the the the fire and we left the
horse meat and we left whatever...but just whatever we could grab, especially a blanket or so, and
we ran towards a road. The SS was still there and when they see us or saw us running, they were
still shooting after us, but luckily uh our name tag was not on their on their on their bullet, and then
all of a sudden uh we reached an area...meantime it had become dark, where we were we were
somehow in no man's land, but not completely because on that road we had to reach, there we saw
the the remnants of the German army, also trying to make their way to the north, and refugees
obviously coming from Berlin with all kinds of vehicles, fire trucks, hearses, milk trucks...whatever
moved, they had used, and sometimes put together because they didn't have enough gasoline
anymore, so they had tied...had tied these together, and we then said well, probably the safest is to
mix with these people, and after all, I had thrown away the the the the stripped coat and I took...had
thrown...not thrown away but put it my pocket the the cap, so I I looked at least like a civilian, and
my friends also whatever they had. We mixed with the the population, and uh so they walked rather
slowly. There was no marching because there were hundreds and thousands of people, pressing
towards the north. They obviously knew that they were pressing towards some kind of of of army
lines, of the American army or the British army. Nobody knew who was operating there, so uh uh
then in this way we were walking the whole night. We heard some shooting. We didn't know what
it was. We were even stuck by by some German soldiers and they said...and luckily we spoke

German and we said the Russians are driving us out and we are going the same way you are doing.
When they heard about the Russians, then they were...they were...[ mean, when you said Russians it
was always for them a cause for alarm and when we were walking slowly and and and and and and
it was dawning slightly and uh somehow...I don't know whether in my...I couldn't sleep and you
walk, but I was dozing somehow...all of a sudden sudden a friend next to me said to me, Norbert,
isn't that the American flag, and I looked up and sure enough there was a bend from one forest area
to another forest area, and there uh uh uh was the the the the American flag, stretched over the over
the the the crowns of the of the of the trees, and uh with the with the uh headlights of the jeep...it
was showing that this is now American-occupied territory and this is where uh the American army
had stopped, because what we didn't know was that uh the 8th Division of the American army had
been lent to Montgomery to cut off the northern uh uh Germans from the southern Germans....from
northern Germany from southern Germany, reaching the city of ____ obviously, and that was the
8th Division. And but at a certain point, uh uh headquarters probably had decided not to continue
operations anymore because they didn't want to take any casualties anymore.

Question: Let's take this back to you. What did you...you saw this flag. I would like to know what
you felt?

Answer: It was...first I I...the the the first moment I didn't realize that it's true, but uh when we saw
that, there was a feeling of...we were laughing and we were crying, embraced each other and and it
was unreal, because it was a feeling of being born again. When you are born you don't know about
it because you have no recollection, but this moment of rebirth is something...it's very special. I
think you cannot describe it properly. The human language is too poor to do that. Anyhow, this

American flag, the symbol of the American flag, has remained for me something which I I I keep
holy because it meant a new lease on life for me and for us, and whenever I see a flag abused or
dis___ or burned, I feel deeply offended. Uh uh...just to repeat this...this flag was and is and
remains for me the symbol of life. When I see, for instance, on the Day of Remembrance uh when
the flags of the regiments are brought in, you know, your heart is beating faster, so when we saw
that, there were there were...well, these few are jeeps and and a few soldiers, but it was a very loose,
loose uh uh...from the front line, so we walked a few...a few hundred yards and all of a sudden we
saw, uh on that road, an American officer, obviously, and when we approached him, he directed his
pistol at us. After all, he didn't know who we were. And thank God my school English and the
English which I had brushed brushed up with the British prisoners of war was good enough to tell
him, uh said sir...and he must have been...later was explained to be somebody with a Texas accent,
because I didn't...I had certain difficulties understanding...between his accent and my accent, it was
not so easy, but anyhow I said, sir, we are we are we are your friends. We are prisoners of
concentration camps and uh thank God we have reached you. And that fellow was was was...I
mean he had seen action obviously everywhere, but this was something new to him. Now you have
to understand, those German soldiers who were reaching the line, had to leave all their packages, all
their cars, everything...they were just driven to a big field nearby and then the soldiers are looking if
there was ammunition or dynamite, whatever it is, and then they tell to the soldiers to assemble
somewhere to take them into custody as prisoners of war. The war wasn't over yet. So uh he said,
you're welcome. If you need anything, you go and you can take whatever you want to, which
means whatever there was on food, we could, and we were one of the first groups that there were
with us were two of my friends and some uh uh French fellow, a Belgium fellow, a Dutch fellow, a
Ukrainian fellow...we all stayed together, and when we saw all of a sudden all that food stuff and so

we thought, well, we have to be careful because because it would become very dangerous because
these were these were very uh fat things and it could be dangerous for our stomach, and sure enough
since then slowly also other groups had crossed there, some of them jumped at this food, and and
and and some of them dropped dead on the spot. So uh uh and then you know all of a sudden we
were safe and we realized and I realized at this moment uh...well, I was with friends but I was alone,
that uh uh I had...when I was still in Auschwitz, uh one day a fellow had come from Birkenau, and
uh that was a time believe it or not that we still believed that women and children would be around,
would be alive, and we asked him, have you heard that is in Birkenau there are children and and
women, and he said are you crazy. I lived in Birkenau now for a year and a half, next to the gas
chambers. When you arrived what happened, and I told him that my wife and my child too was
taken away immediately. With that he said I'm sorry to tell you there's no hope, and I still could not
completely...completely believe it, though we lived already in the shadows of the crematorium and
the shadows of the gas chambers, but then when I reached the line on...was the night from from
May 2nd to May 3rd, 1945, which I call my and our second birthday, I realized I was alone. I was
certain my parents were gone, my family was gone and and and I was joyful but at the same time
terribly sad, because I couldn't share in the joys of the other...for instance, of the Belgium fellow and
the French fellow and and the Dutch fellow who was certain that they could go home soon and and
go back to normal life and find their home and find their families. I knew I had no family anymore.
I had no home anymore and and I had...I don't know...didn't know what the future would be, but
really, that was that was what what made this moment so so terribly sad. Uh but nevertheless we
con...we continued uh on that road which led into the city of ____—_—.-: Landed in the morning there,
and there you could see what a defeat of a big army meant...hundreds and thousands of
wea...weapons had been thrown away by the by the Germans. The war was still on...including

machine guns, bazookas, uh machine pistols, rifles...you you name it. Uh we didn't take any of that
to shoot the SS. It didn't occur to us. We were not made that way. It probably would have been
better to do it, but we trusted uh that justice would would prevail and that that these criminals would
would would get what they deserved to. Well, that's another story. We reached the cityof
We came to the...we were directed to the to the...by the way, on the way we saw, for instance,
American troops. They were they were cold, but they had put on a fire and they had gotten
somewhere bundles of German marks, you know. They were using these bundles to to lit a fire, and
came...we were directed to a building which was called military government...that was new to me.
Military government... didn't know what it meant, but it was closed. Six o'clock...there was no
office hours, you know. So uh uh and and uh I didn't know what to do. One of my friends I was
with was very sick. He could hardly walk anymore, so I then took the initiative and uh went into
into one of these uh uh buildings in _, and I was told by that French fellow that...the lady was
nice enough. She gave him some some some water so that he could could wash himself and so I
went, and I had in my pocket still twenty German marks I had smuggled from Auschwitz, and I
went to that lady and said uh I need two rooms for for my friends and myself. We are this and that
and says well difficulties...the families are evacuated, fled from the Russians and so...and you know,
at this time you didn't accept these these apologies and so I said I need two rooms. And as a token
of my good will, I give you my last twenty marks, so luckily we found these rooms, so then we
could somehow clean ourselves after all these days and those ten days...I mean we looked terrible. I
shaved again, but I ___ and _I put our friend who was in very very bad shape shape to bed and I
was looking for for for help. I went back to the military government. I was coming and going and I
said for goodness sake, amongst these people there must be some of my old friends from the youth
movement and so have joined the army. Eventually I could meet some of them. And all of a

sudden I saw a jeep uh driving up and uh a man came down and a racial mark... thought he
was Jewish...a hefty fellow. I approached him and, you know, at these days uh the the troops they
were carrying their pistol mostly on on in front of them or or they had these short machine guns and
so uh so I approached him, and asked are you Jewish. And he said yes, but what's it your business,
and I whispered to him uh I'm also Jewish. He said for dancing (ph)...what are you doing here.
And so I told him. I said uh just hours ago your Army liberated me and a few of my friends. I'm
happy to shake hands with the first Jewish soldier. (Pause) (Crying ?) Excuse me.
Question: It's OK. Do you use kleenex?
Answer: Yeah.
Question: Use kleenex. Take your time. It's alright.
Answer: It's so long ago, you know, and still it's it's gripping you. So uh he embraced me, and he
was crying. (Crying) And he was a fellow who has seen action in Normandy and so on and he was
a hardened soldier. You could see his decorations and so...but uh...crying like a child, and he said
uh , which is that old Jewish salutation, peace be with you. And uh after this uh after we
had somehow uh and ___ then go this way. Beyond the uh the uh the uh encounter when we first
on the group with American flag, this was one of the things which has remained one of the strongest
story of my life...uh to greet uh for the first time, after all we had come through, a Jewish soldier
who had come from far away, had crossed the ocean, had had left his family, had left his home, and
had carried arms against Hitler, and was one of my liberators and uh uh then his first question was

uh what can I do for you, and uh well, I told him uh uh after having calmed down, we're just uh
short of everything, and he just looked at how I looked. I didn't have a Brooks Brothers suit, so uh
what do you need. I said we need everything. A friend of mine...where do you stay. Where are
you? I told him that have found uh shelter with a with a with an apartment with a German lady and
so uh he said well, I don't know...I should like...would like to see our chaplain but I don't know
where he is but uh tell you uh now it is so and so and you know, they had the watch... will never
forget...on this side __ for one reason or the other, not here but here. Be here in two hours. Now
I was ashamed of myself. I didn't have a watch, you know, so I tried to be there ha...one one hour
later because he said he would come back, and sure enough he came back and he had already
recruited some other Jewish boys of his unit. It was a tank unit. A tank unit which had been uh had
seen uh quite some ___ action from Normandy uh through via via northern Germany and so on,
and uh he came as he had promised and he brought all kind of things uh they had just gotten
together...some K-rations and so they didn't like anymore, and that certainly that was manna
from...and and and I was happy that I could tell my friends...and then he wanted to know where
where we are...

Question: I'm sorry. Say it again. I couldn't hear you.

Answer: Uh he wanted to know where where I'm located..he wanted to say where are you put up. I
wanted to see...] want...I want to see that you are well off because, you know, as they say these
these boys were the first and best untrained social workers I have ever met. They didn't need any
training, because they had seen what they had seen. They felt deeply. They understood very well,
and they reacted just out of a of a sense of human solidarity, call it also Jewish solidarity, and so

they didn't ask of Army regulations or this and that. Certainly they wouldn't be allowed to give the
K-rations to civilians, but for them it didn't matter. So what. And then he came...uh this fellow was
from, by the way, Pittsburgh. He's not around anymore unfortunately. And uh he wanted to see
where we lived. The landlady was was was deeply afraid. She thought that they would come after
her because her husband uh had been or was serving as an air force major I think, and you know, the
Germans had a very bad uh conscious certainly and a certain guilt complex...
Question: OK. What what I need to do...because we want to make sure we have plenty of time...is
can you tell us in little short about what...briefly...where he took you and what happened so we can
move to the DP camps. We want to talk about what you did with your work with ;
Answer: Well, that's another story because because certainly uh...
Question: What ha...where did he...where did he take you....?
Answer: Yeah...I tell you...because...here he then helped us with with certain things we needed,
especially bread, for instance. And I went...still I 1 looked for some contacts and I was told that
amongst the CSC, the the CIA...the the counter intelligence...the Jewish fellows from Germany or
so...and I went to the to the Supreme Court building in . The city was not badly bombed by
the way, but I met only some Austrian fellow who was only interested in my story about ;
I've never lived in . I couldn't help them. What I did not know was that in this intelligence
unit was a man who originated from Frankfurt, a lawyer, who had escaped to America in time, had

volunteered for the American army, but he had given order that if any...if they should find any body
who is from Germany and knows about Jewish affairs, he would...wants to be advised. Two days
later I was told that he is waiting for me. When we met, he asked me does the name so and so mean
anything to you, and he was very strict and all officer or staff sergeant of the intelligence service,
said does the name so and so mean anything to you. I said yes. He said how. He said the name you
are mentioning, he was a former youth leader...leader of my youth movement, and that man said
well, I cannot say that I am happy to see you here, but uh I am a friend of your friends in New York,
and I am happy to give though I am not authorized specially to do it, but I will write to give you a
welcome and and and and it's good to see you here alive and and and kicking. And then he uh told
me be ready uh in two days. I will come. I will work with you a little bit, and he came and in his
jeep he brought things we hadn't seen for for days and for years and for years...not only K-rations
but also packages he had gotten from America and so and he gave us, my friends and me, and he
became a close friend of ours from this day on. Four months ago he unfortunately passed away at
the age of ninety. He was a was a lawyer and member of one of the leading law firms in New York.
When we met, he said from the beginning, what is your intention, and in our naivete I said well, uh
get us an American uniform and we'll go with you. He said don't be ridiculous, because it will take
much longer than you think uh to to to get over it...don't you want to go back to Berlin. I said under
no circumstances. I know that I have nobody to find there. Uh then he told me that the Russians
will take over the area and uh so he helped us to get to a place called _———_— which was not badly
badly bombed and he was also very very helpful, almost instrumental to find the group I had
collected in the meantime in__ to take to ..some fellow inmates from Germany, from
Poland, from Lithuanian and so and we came to then approximately...we stayed in
uh May...early in Ju...June. We were able to uh...and there again we found some temporary shelter

in some German...German households as subtenants, and I was always staying together with the
same friends with whom I had run away and one of them, by the way, was the was the first husband
of my wife now, who unfortunately uh perished...uh passed away uh years ago. In__ we heard
over the radio that there's a camp Bergen-Belsen. The name was never...never heard about it before,
and that there approximately thirty thousand Jews had been discovered so uh to get there was not
easy because all the uh roads were closed, militarily controlled. | was under British
administration, but I managed somehow to establish a contact with the office of the International
Red Cross in___, and one day they took supplies, which they didn't need for their prisoners of
war anymore, to Belsen, and I I talked to the...and and the fellow said I cannot...nobody can give
you a passport here. You have to try to smuggle yourself from here to Belsen. So I went in the
morning to one of the drivers who was a Swiss fellow, and he said yes, I have...but listen, I I cannot
help you. They will not let you because the bridges in __are are are strictly controlled. I said
leave it to me. You have...I understand in these trucks there is a certain opening where you sleep
sometimes during the night, so give me a chance just to crouch into...to sneak into that and when it's
over then...so that's what he did. I went and before we reached Hamburg, I was sneaking into this
caboose they call it, and when we were beyond the bridges...he as a Swiss certainly had the right
papers...we we uh we uh were on the way to Belsen, and before we uh we entered Belsen...there
was a whole convoy with supplies of Red Cross parcels...we were waiting there. A man drove up in
a British uniform, a staff sergeant, introduced himself as Staff Sergeant Kline (ph)...and I later found
out that he was one of the first to enter Bergen-Belsen with the amplifier unit to to to to announce
that Belsen would be free in Yiddish and in German and in Hebrew and in Polish and in Russian.
That was the so-called amplifier unit. And we talked and he said where are you from and I told him
my story of Berlin and he said we have in our unit a fellow from Berlin. That's interesting. Uh

what did he do? He said he was...he did work in an orphan's home. I said what is his name. He
said Harry Harrison. I said Harry Harrison...this is no name which was usual in Berlin. Would it
have been eventually Hans _————.-s This fellow I knew from our youth movement and he was
closely associated with my sister, blessed memory. He had to flee Berlin because he was stateless
but my sister wanted to join him and couldn't get out any more. He said no..Hans__, I never
heard it. It's Harry Harrison. He said I have a suggestion to make. Come to our mess and you will
meet also our officer who is an interesting fellow named Derrick (ph) ____ and uh have uh lunch
there. Now this was for me...I mean to have lunch in a mess...anyhow terrific. I got there and
became acquainted with this wonderful fellow Derrick __, who by the way has written a very
important book about Belsen uncovered, and we...but Harry Harrison wasn't there. We were
waiting and then all of a sudden, after lunch, he came because he has another mission and certainly
it was Hans __, and when he saw me he almost fainted and he said to me then, Norbert, we're
entitled to a bottle of whiskey every week or second week. I've never touched it because as you
know in the youth movement, you didn't use to drink. I always gave it away. Today I have to...now
I have to empty this bottle. And then he certainly asked questions about his parents, about my sister
and all this, so it was Harry. Doesn't...in this way I got to Belsen. And I asked him what is it I hear
about thousands of Jews. He said yes, uh there is...I'm trying to to uh be helpful in to do something
for the children here but it's still very chaotic because the typhus was rampant. Uh the old camp has
been burned down. People have been transferred into this new camp which it was an old army
barracks, the Panther __, the Panther School of the Germans, but I advise you try to make your
way to a building there where you'll find uh uh people who are trying to organize some some some
committees. I got to that building and I met met a fellow in a peculiar kind of a uniform. Later I
found out it was a Yugoslavian uh army uniform, and the man I met was the senior chaplain of

the...former senior chaplain of the Yugoslavian army by the name of » NOW ;
who had studied in Vienna, spoke German perfect and and told him that [have come from
We have almost eight hundred DPs. Uh we need help badly and we hear there's thousands of
people and you obviously have the support of the army and the committees and so...and no...he said
it is now so. We are still in very, very difficult uh in a difficult situation. For days my activity here
was since I was a liberated from an officer's camp of the Yugoslavian army, was my first function to
bring people to to bury people by the hundreds and by the thousands. Uh it's still very chaotic, but
wait a second. There is a committee and the man who is leading is a man by the name of :
He is our . Now is something which I couldn't understand because __is
something in German, used in northern Germany as the as the head of a of a city or so, and I didn't
know that it was called president. And after a certain while there came a a man of a rather small
stature. I'll never forget...with a with a lily white shirt, clean like a whistle. His hair was still very
short because uh he was shaven, and with with burning eyes. So uh he spoke Yiddish. I spoke
German or my so-called Yiddish, and uh we started to talk. He said what we're asking...what can I
do, and I told him what the situation is. We need uh help, and I tried to smuggle myself here into
Bergen-Belsen because I heard about you and I heard that the Jewish chaplain here and so on, and
he said listen, what the radio says is something else. We are still in a very difficult situation. We
are trying to bring order into this chaos here we have. Sure, there are approximately thirty thousand
Jews. Most of them are terribly sick. Every day still we are loosing I don't know how many in
spite of all the attempts, especially by the British army who is giving us wonderful help, but if you
want to try to do something in order to to alleviate our situation, we have to join hands. Try to come
uh I think in two weeks or one week or two weeks, and we'll have a meeting of our people we are
trying to organize, a Jewish uh committee. You want to help. You are very welcomed. And that

was the end of that day, and I smuggled myself back again with that Swiss driver, came to our
people and the people, and you know, we had to start also to organize something in ____—__— where
interesting enough, the synagogue was not completely destroyed. It was vandalized but not
destroyed, so we had already the first services which was an emotional experience of a special kind
and and and we had org...since in other words and the the uh community building next to the
synagogue was not destroyed, so we had already started to try to organize some kind of a new
Jewish community, because there were two, three or four Jews married to non-Jewesses who had
been saved, and you know about the community and so, so they all wanted to know what could they
achieve. I said they achieve nothing, just to hope that something will happen, but and then work on
it to uh to uh to get to Belsen two weeks later, which was not easy because I was still...they have
strict controls but I was able in the meantime with the help of another Jewish-American soldiers to
organize a small car and and and to get visas was a whole experience (coughing). Luckily I had my
driver's license uh uh made before the war, so I made my way uh uh...yeah, and I was ready ready to
to to go to Belsen, and all of a sudden, the next day, when all of a sudden people came running
from...there was a small DP camp in a barracks in__, and they came running to me and said
listen, there is a truck and on the truck, on a military truck, on top there is written uh uh in Hebrew

. The the people of Israel lives, and then, interesting enough, when he was talking,
this truck drove up at my place where I found shelter and out came a man who introduced himself to
me as Mr. Trobe (ph), as the European Director of the American Joint, and Leonard Cohen as the
Director of the Central British Fund in in England. They were on a fact-finding tour to find out
what what happened to Belsen and they had come to ___ because they were told there were Jews
living...probably based on my report, so we talked. I gave them a run-down of the situation. They
said listen, we go back tomorrow to to Belsen, and I understand there is a meeting. Join us. And

that was very helpful because he said if I have difficulties at the at the military controls, you can
help me out, and that's what what what we did, and we came to that meeting and there was uh
was...for the first time a representative of the of the uh of the Joint, a representative of the Central
British Fund of England, a representative, I understand, of the Pope, because there were not not
Jews only in Belsen, and the...this representative spoke spoke uh French only, and interesting
enough, there was a lady amongst us who answered him in Fren...in French, and I thought it was a
good friend, and this was___ because you know, she had studied in France for a certain years
and spoke French fluently, so uh that was that was...call it stock-taking and we we we we we spoke
about our hopes and our this and our needs and they said alright, we will try as soon as possible,
we'll go back to England and to America to organize help for you and uh at this time, uh

made it already very clear that this ought to be done in cooperation with the organized group of the
survivors. Uh and then when the meeting was over, he invited me to the room of —__,_ who had
in cantino they call it a very her only room. It was special because I know there was there was an
easy chair where you could sit down uh, almost in luxury, and there was a couch, not these military
beds or so. And uh we started to talk and all of a sudden we were in the middle of our discussion
about uh Stephen sand Franz ——__ and and and ___, and so, so uh it it it
was...and this established my my friendship with from from that moment on, and uh then
again uh we came to the conclusion we should try to meet more regularly and I was advised that I

Dean of the Law School in Philadelphia. Later, if I'm not mistaken, the President of the of the
University, and based on on on reports about the plight of the DP's in general and the Jewish...in
general and the Jewish DP's especially, President Truman had appointed Harrison and asked
him...for a fact-finding uh mission.
Question: I'm going to encapsulate a little. Just tell us about the meeting with Harrison when he
came. And say it that way, when Harrison came...
Answer: Yeah. So uh uh these were the participants. And the first to report about the situation
was uh , in Yiddish...
Question: Excuse me. Where are we now? Is this in...?
Answer: In Belsen. In Belsen.
Question: In Belsen, with Harrison now?
Answer: With...Harrison came. In this company was Dr. Joseph Schwartz who was then the
European Director of the Joint, and Mr. who was for many years associated with the
Committee for Intergovernmental uh uh Committees, and uh we met in Belsen, one of the barracks,
and uh reporting about the situation because Harrison...Harrison was interested. He wanted to know
exactly what was going on, and it was already I think in...in early fall or so. The next to speak was

_____ Levy _ and he...well, it's not only that he's an excellent speaker but a very powerful speaker,
and for the first time in my life I heard a man in an officer's uniform who is a rabbi, taking his
government to task about the deficiency and about the short-coming and about the fact that in spite
of all the appeals also he has made, uh uh as a rabbi and and and as an of...as a member of the
Jewish community in England, almost nothing had been done, and I was flabbergasted because this
in my background, you might call it Prussian background, this is something I I didn't expect.
_______ spoke also and then uh uh they asked me and asked me to make a presentation in English,
and I was sweating because it was still...1 mean my English was call it acceptable but but it was still
difficult and I said and but but the heart dictated me what to say about the uh the mental disposition,
about the expectations we had, that we are liberated but not free, especially free from need, that we
need almost everything, that the winter is threatening, that most of our people are still cooped up.
They don't want to go back to Poland or to to to these places, like I don't want to go back to to to
Berlin, that all this is transitory and that that this...we don't know...uh we have no expectations of the
future. We don't know what the future will bring, but there is still dire needs that uh uh after we
have buried most of of our victims and this is the first thing we did actually, uh now it's the time
where we are trying to at least give them enough food that they that they that they can fill their
stomach, enough to wear and and also work out a program what can be done for the future because
those people who are liberated, with a very few exceptions, do not want to stay in Germany, and it
was very...made very clear and we had accepted already that line that certainly the the emphasis is
that people want to go to then Palestine, but also those who want to join their relatives in England
and America, should been given the opportunity as soon as possible to do this because Europe is
one big cemetery for us, and therefore we we we we uh we we...the sooner the better we we'll get
out because otherwise it will be demoralizing to stay with a population which considers us as

enemies just just only weeks ago, and uh to start again what what the generation did for
us...establish a career, establish uh uh a business or what...we are not tempted to do that, and uh so
uh as I say with difficulties I managed to make that statement and uh I felt...what can I say...uh very
very ___ (laughter). So interesting enough, I...half an hour later I met Harrison in the same
bathroom and and he was a wonderful man, by the way...charming, warm-hearted, compassionate
and I said I'm sorry but uh this is my English. I hope I can...one day it will be better, and he said
don't you worry. It's not important how good you speak in English. It is the meaning of what you
try to bring out which is important to me, and this is what I will try to bring to the President, and
sure enough, as you know, Harrison immediately went back uh so gave this uh uh report to uh to uh
to uh President Truman and Truman almost immediately then used this report to...he could only
give directives to Eisenhower in the American zone, but at the same time then with a request that a
hundred thousand DP's should be should be given the opportunity to to leave Germany immediately
for for Palestine and this and that, so uh uh in this respect the Earl...the Earl Harrison mission was, I
would say, a milestone. It wasn't as successful as as we had hoped, because things were still too
much in turmoil in these days. Uh the state of Israel was was was not in existence. The British
were stubborn in their policy not to admit, and America was still before the DP bill, strictly adhering
to the to the quotas, but uh uh somehow it had, I would say it had penetrated the sound barrier
somehow. And after that uh we...

END OF TAPE 6
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
Question: OK. We're back. Uh Norbert, tell us about the work now, please, that you did in
Bergen-Belsen with the , and would you repeat the sentence that way.
Answer: Uh well, after the Harrison mission...but I had started before already...we concentrated
mainly in our...first of all to to organize our committee, to our committee, uh uh in other words
taking in whoever wanted to be represented of the of the camp in Belsen along certain call it party
line...labor and and so on, I mean the old, the old tradition from Poland had been carried on
also in Belsen, but the other...because also to bring all these people outside of Belsen into the fold,
into the committee which means communities uh uh which were which were organized in cities like
Cologne (ph), and and and , Dusseldorf and Hamburg and so on, and we...we then were
able, interesting enough, to uh to have a united central committee of Jews originating from
Germany, from Poland, from Hungary, from Lithuania, from wherever it was, in one institution in
order to try to work on whatever the problems of the day were. One of the problems we had at the
beginning immediately was that for instance people of German nationality were treated by the
occupational authorities as German nationals and they were told that they can have help only from

the...could get help only from German mayor (ph), which was absurd, it was at this time, but
we...that was one of the the ideological contacts and in this respect and and *
____ and all the other friends who were with us in the central committee, this is...call it some kind
of heritage we are taking along with us from Auschwitz, that we had Auschwitz uh uh experience,
not as Germans or Lithuanians or Poles or or Hungarians but as Jews, and that therefore the the
solution of our problem could only be found in in finding an answer to the Jewish needs. Now that
certainly was to to find a way out of Germany, uh one way or the other. Uh there were other dire
dire needs at the beginning. Uh uh we talk about food, clothing, religious needs. Uh there was also
a a problem to bring relatives together. Uh men were looking for their wives, hoped...in the hope to
find them. Wives are looking for their children to to find them. We prepared lists, for instance,
which were uh uh exchanged with the with the people in in the American zone and other DP camps
and so forth. Uh but also uh at the beginning very strongly that help should be forthcoming to
alleviate the physical situation, and in this respect then luckily the Joint was able to bring the first uh
supplies in and in that committee in Belsen, it was decided that everybody should get the same,
irrespective of origin, irrespective of whatever it was, whether living in Belsen or living outside of
Belsen, and and that worked well. We had some kind of a we called it, which means
economical uh department and we got together with the Joint and with the Jewish relief unit and we
were sitting together checking the needs and then making the distribution and the central committee
had a say in all this and not only that we were working together. We were very proud of this in in
organizational ways but we became very good friends. It was it was really a a deep friendship
which developed and which it lasted for a long time after we left Bel...Belsen already and which
manifested itself whether there was uh many weddings, for instance, occurred and we went there
together and there came came came __and there came came came all kinds of occasions and we

were we were always together and and and uh I would say in this respect, I must say, Joseph (ph)
and __ were very instrumental in developing an atmosphere in which you did not only (cough)
discuss business but also asked, you know that Yiddish expression ..what is going on
with the family, what...and people then revealed what what what what their their innermost...what's
bothering them and so so you knew you had a place where you could exchange not only views but
your mood with with with friends. Uh it was not always easy. We had a situation, for instance,
when the British decided that uh uh uh people who had tried to reach Israel illegally...the Exodus,
with the famous Exodus ship...should be brought back to Germany and they were were then forced
to to land in in Hamburg and were brought to two camps near the place where I had my my home,
my transitory home near __ and _ that was a very, very difficult uh situation for us because
tensions were high. Amongst those people who had been brought back in force were our friends
and relatives and so it...we had a a terrible responsibility somehow to regulate the tension because
there were people, certainly militant people who wanted to take it out on the British and uh we felt
as responsible leaders that we should try to avoid it. After all uh __ was the spokesman of the
people in the camps. I was accredited to the British authorities as a spokesman for Jews living in
the cities, so we had a certain standing but what was more important, we had also established a
close uh line to our friends of the World Jewish Council in London uh who as members of
Parliament like Sidney Silverman andand and , were able to help
us in whatever was to helped. Two fold as I say...with the the help of food and and...and also the
religious help. Belgium, for instance, helped the people in in the cities around with __, with
with with religious people and so but the other work we were involved in was call it political
work...to know that this is a transitory existence, that living...that life in a camp is no normal life,
that it has to come to an end, and that's the reason why when _ and | were traveling very often

to London, and we had...with our friends of the World Jewish Congress...we had meetings with the
politicians, with the head of government, not with a representative, interesting enough, of the British
Army or the British Military Government in Germany, but we met very often with the with
the...because we had a shorter line ——_—.~You know, in Germany everything had to go through
channels and in London with the help of our friends, we didn't need that and uh Joseph (ph) was one
of the first ones to come to America. He was the first , the first messenger and and lift up
interest for a for a solution (coughing) and he did not uh uh...that was not a fund raising speech.
These were not fund raising speeches he made. He made speeches just to say don't let us rot away
in in the camps. Don't let us...don't leave us alone to repeat this. We are liberated but we are not
free. And we don't feel free before we have a chance to build a new existence, wherever it was...in
Palestine or in America or wherever it is, but a normal existence for for our families and for ourself
in order to reestablish life and a new career and and and and to make our own contributions. This
went on...we had this for...1 remember uh uh that things were were so terribly difficult in London.
____ and I met uh and that was at a very very difficult time and we needed badly
moral support uh in order...because the people really almost got got into despair, and what could
we...what could we tell them time and again. Have hope and it will become better and so...so we
asked uh to come to Germany, and he said no, I can't, uh for two reasons. Number
one my foot will never touch the bloody soil of Germany again, and number two, what kind...what
kind of a message can I bring to the survivors...lies. I cannot bring lies. And there is nothing I can
bring them. These were the situations under which we were working, and uh then luckily uh you
know, came came the development after Exodus which was a really a very difficult chapter, that
then in in in May 1948, Israel was created as a state and then slowly but surely we knew that those
who wanted to go to then Israel would would would be able. Not immediately because there was a

technical problem. Uh Israel was at war with the Arab neighbors. Uh people volunteered to go to
Israel. Some of them did. Many of them who came to Israel were pressed immediately into the
____and and gave their life away, especially in the battle of , had hardly seen the
country and were killed in action, so it was a was a was a troublesome uh time but then slowly but
surely things got organized and the the camp could be could be could be uh uh uh...I wouldn't say
cleaned out but could could be evacuated with...and also then the...luckily the uh the uh DP bill
came into action, so people who wanted to go to America had the chance to do so, but the
Americans had an interesting practice. First they they they take care of the American zone of
Germany so the people in the British zone had to wait, but it was all not that easy either, because I
remember when I came...was invited by the United Jewish Appeal in 1946 to come and to bring the
message to the Jews of of of America in the west...in the east and also was taken to Los Angeles and
Seattle and Portland and San Diego and at this time I reported about the situation, that that not even
the the quarters available were be...were used, and uh but that in in the British zone, but that in the
American zone, they were...they had made already...they had begun to do this, and I went to the
head of the immigration department. I think I was taken in Washington here, and uh this
man...obviously he was not the smartest...gave us as an answer that they have not enough funds
available in order to establish processing centers for security, to to check security and so on, so the
man I was with then was was leading our delegation, said if that is so sir, I might suggest to the
Jewish community in America to make a fund raising for the government of America in order to uh
to uh finance the immigration department, but still it didn't help. But when the DP camp...uh DP
bill came into into... mean was was started, then slowly all those who wanted to leave left and that
was the majority of the DP's. Some were left. Some had built uh built new lives in Germany. I
don't want to talk about that, but those...and I must say then we felt that our job in Germany was

done and that we could leave because...but it took us longer than we thought. It was almost five
years after until until until uh the Belsen ceased to exist and also uh uh uh those who couldn't leave
then found a place in Norway or so for medical reasons or other reasons, so that was then and and I
decided then also to leave to leave Germany. I was asked by my friend...at this time I had already
started to take...to have uh contact with the progressive uh forces in Germany...progressive political
forces and and and was asked why did you leave Germany. Uh we need you here and I said listen, I
haven't destroyed Germany. I have no duty to build it to build it up again, and I I can't. For me,
Germany is one big cemetery. I have nobody here, and in the meantime I'm married again. I found
a lady from my youth movement and married in Belsen. I married her in Belsen. We had two
children in and then we came to the conclusion that also in the interest of the children, we
would not stay in Germany, and this is then when we decided to to uh to uh leave Germany. There
was still another job to be done in which I participated and that was uh uh...that was under the
military statute, a so-called successor organization was built to claim the heirless and community
property of the Jewish community. This was under Allied law with the seat in London and uh I
became one of the founders and we were able then to solve the problems by putting all the funds
which which which uh accumulated out of community property which was not used by new
communities, and heirless property into one fund and uh this fund was administered by a mutual
committee of the communities and the major Jewish organizations and then distributed especially
for social purposes for needed people in Israel and in in America, so that was the Jewish Trust
Corporation and and and then I came to the United States. I landed in and was in 1952 together
with my then wife and my two children.

Answer. Uh uh I I learned one lesson from my from my teacher, my spiritual mentor, Leo Beck
(ph), who said America is not the country of social continuity. In other words, what I had done in in
Germany, studying law and being a social worker and so on, wouldn't work, and then after a certain
while many friends advised me if I would still have...like to do something with law so many
newcomers, especially of Germany, had had had found uh uh a way to establish themselves and
have a career in the field of accountancy, so uh I I went back to the University. Luckily NYU, the
New York University, was generous enough to give me certain credit points for my studies in
Germany, and I took up the uh the uh studies of accounting...of public...and became a public
accountant. I never was an enthusiastic auditor or or or tax tax preparer, but it was a a profession
which which uh uh guaranteed me an income to give my family whatever was required and and to
make a a a call it comfortable life and uh this is what I did uh from the moment then when I entered
the professional life and uh uh until recently when I retired after having done enough uh coming to
the conclusion that whatever I had done for ___—_—sw would never be enough in order to meet the
requirements of the budget, so uh uh as I say I was...but irrespective of the of the of the accounting
business, I still kept my interest in in in organizational work. Certainly at the beginning I had to
establish first my family. I had a home and and so on and get settled uh and uh then I I also took
some time out to do something for for other things again. I, for instance, there was when I was still
in Germany one day uh __, which is the equivalent of of the duPont in America, uh
star...published a a statement saying that the former stockholders should uh file...should register
their claims. Now I told you before that we worked in Auschwitz for the factory —_—s was
building there, but that we never got a penny from them paid at whatever...that we just uh uh
worked in order to keep...to stay alive, but that ___— paid a certain amount of money, small money

to the SS which considered us as ____ and and and had a profit out of our work, so when I saw
that statement in in papers saying that...and after the war when you had a West Germany and an
East Germany, the of uh uh where the records had had been lost somehow and
they wanted to register the stockholders and claims which certain people had against __——__—, so
they published that statement and there all of a sudden I had a brain-storm, and I said if they ask for
claims to be registered, I think that we also...I also have a claim. They never paid me a penny for
my slave work. Uh I'm entitled to something, and I approached with this question in mind, a man
who I had befriended when I was living in___—«.-~*He was a refugee from Frankfurt, had returned
with the British Army, had participated in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen and he had then become
an officer in the control commission, regulating the admission of people to the press, to the movies
and so and I met him when I became a witness against one of the movie directors, but that's another
story in Hamburg. He uh returned to Germany to open a practice again in Frankfurt,
and him I approached with the question. I said what do you think. Uh not under the Nuremburg
Laws...under the Nuremburg...Nuremburg... the rules of the Nuremburg...though I had been a
witness against before the American Military Tribunal in in Nuremburg, but don't you
think there is under the civil court of Germany, there is a certain claim and he was doubtful. But at
the same time I befriended uh uh in connection with the with the case which was pending against a
Nazi director of uh... was his name, a man who was the the prosecutor, the chief
prosecutor in Hamburg, but he originally was an expert on labor law, German labor law, and when
we discussed it, he said my goodness, that's that's there's dynamite in that. Nobody can tell you
you'll be successful, but this is...by all means you should bring suit, so my friend __ alright. I'll
take the case, and we brought suit against sin my name and uh then all of a sudden when the
papers started to write about it and uh then there was a trial in in Frankfurt. Quite a long story...and

some of our...my British prisoner of war friends came as my witness to give evidence against

, like they did, by the way, also in Nuremburg, so I got a verdict in my favor by the by the
District Court in Frankfurt, the German District Court in Frankfurt under the German law saying
that the people like me had worked under the...in the shadow of death, in the shadow of the gas
chambers, that knowing this should have taken better care of those people and give them
human consideration, but had obviously accepted these people as slaves and therefore they are
responsible for for the treatment, for mistreatment, more treatment, and they...we had uh asked for
an award of 10,000 marks. This is a technical thing because 10,000...you know, under German
tules and regulations you are giv...you are responsible if you loose, you are responsible for all the
costs in court and of the other...of the lawyers of the other side, but 10,000 guarantees you also to
tun a petition of appeal, so uh when that...when the verdict came out I was already in the United
States and in the German papers, there was an outcry, even headlines, that I'm endangering
Germany industry because not only had taken had taken slave labors, but also
and the others and__—_and by the way, we had arranged it in such a way that my uh case should
be considered a a class action case so that that the others, the thousands who are...were still alive
would then be entitled to the same claim I had satis...1 I got...had satisfied, in order to avoid and
avoid a flood of of of uh procedures in the German courts, so uh uh uh as I say the press started to to
to to get desperate and uh then it became very serious because then _, they did not give in.
They didn't have the the moral fortitude to say yes, we know something went wrong in Auschwitz.
Yes, (cough) we feel there is a certain if not legal, at least moral responsibility, and we agree to to
act uh uh in response to that to that responsibility. They said no, they had been forced to do that and
in certain briefs...1 saw that just recently again...they even tried to sell, to tell what a kind of a
sanitorium it was they had created for us in in Auschwitz, and another interesting facet of that which

their lawyers found that if they hadn't uh taken us as slaves in in Auschwitz, then we under normal
conditions probably would have to go to the Russian front and could have been killed there easily so
I say this is something which is is unbelievable. Uh they they did not give in and (drinking-pause) I
uh reactionary...reactionary forces in Germany which were prevailing, at that time of the Buna's
(ph) Republic already...Buna's Republic..Federal Republic. They said no no...you we have...you
have to go uh and encourage __—___ to run a petition of appeal, and this was negotiated in the
meantime knowing that I was...uh my lawyer and I were not strong enough to to fight this fight
alone. Lapproached __ Goodman, you know, the...blessed memory...the leader of world Jewry at
this time and uh I knew him personally through —_ and uh I asked for help and for his support,
and there was already a situation created by him for claims against Germany called the
Conferenceon__ Claims against Germany, briefly, the Claims Conference, and he saw to it that
uh uh support was given and in this way we were able touh add to Mr.__ uh uh activity, the help
of two very famous lawyers, Mr. Christian (ph), a non-Jewish man, and Mr. ___s who came out of
a very famous practice in Munich originally and had fled to Israel. Uh the court in in in then in the
in the appeals court said well, we are we are not able to make history. This is a case which we are
not able to make history, and they advised very strongly to look for some kind of a...call it
amicable settlement, and uh after this happened again they tried through the press in Germany to say
what it would mean and what German industry would go into bankruptcy and they had just started
now after the establishment of the Federal Republic to find their way in the world, in the
economical world and it would be terrible...1 would do terrible damage. Uh also there was...I had
some help in America, because there also some stories brought into the Times, and so it were
helpful to needle them, so that I knew that they were not silent. Uh to cut a long story short, uh uh
negotiations were started between representatives of the Claims Conference and __ and it settled

in a so-called amicable settlement of thirty million _ for all survivors, for all those who had
survived on the basis of that in addition to claims they could make under the German ____—_ Laws,
they could claim additional five thousand marks for work they had performed for sin
Auschwitz, and a whole mechanism had to be uh uh established to to work on that. There was a
special German corporation built just to receive the money and to distribute it and with the help uh
of uh of uh fellow survivors who checked applications and so, it took quite some time. Uh these
were paid on the basis of those who were in Buna at least six months, that five thousand marks and
those were in Buna less than six months, two and a half...two and a half thousand marks, and uh...
Question: For the purpose of the tape, would you just explain that Buna was the subcamp...
Answer: Buna was the subcamp of of Auschwitz where where the actually had had
established...had tried to build in the interest of German war industry, a factory to produce artificial
rubber, so all those who had worked like myself there, were then were then given an additional uh
uh uh call it compensation. Based on that, the Claims Conference also tried to negotiate similar
deals with _ and all the others. In some cases were successful, in some cases it was not. One of
the successful...unsuccessful cases remain the group of a man by the name of Flick (ph) who was
brought to Nuremburg as a war criminal, was sent to prison, had time in prison to re-establish his
empire including Mercedes (ph) and others, and up to his very...to the last day of his life, he refused
categorically to hear anything about additional compensation for slave laborers, so he went to his
grave or to to to hell, wherever he may be, with...and he can say for himself, be satisfied that that he
didn't do any favors to former slave laborers. Uh and then with some money which which was left
over from this, we were able to establish in Israel at the end some kind of a loan uh uh loan uh uh

fund for needy people. There was especially after the Six Day War and so so uh that that...and so
uh now this chapter is is closed because it took years to liquidate all this. Uh the question is, was I
right in doing it? Was I not right in doing it? Very often I doubt that that what I did was was was so
smart for the very simple reason uh they, the German...German and , some of Germany...I
will not generalize...I don't like to be unfair...used the the the fact that __ had paid what they paid
as an argument to say well, what we have done...it was...we were not legally..it's not legally...we
were not under legal liability but we did it our of our good heart in for and consequently the record
is clean with us. We didn't do anything in in Auschwitz. What they did in in Nuremberg was was a
was a crime that they sent us to jail for for for participation of this uh uh...we did it out out of our
good heart and and even helped the the prisoners there, so as I say, I'm not very happy but it's water
over the dam. You cannot rewind the the film, but it is a certain chapter which was called the the
beginning of the slave labor programs, in order to give our people, especially those in need in Israel,
in South America, where the _—ihad a certain importance, where it was somehow helpful, and
I'm glad that that some people, even with five thousand marks, could could make life a little bit
easier for themselves.

Question: Good. I thank you. Uh tell me, while you were going through all of this with
what...and you were talking about all the publicity in the German press and whatever, were there
any kind of attacks on you personally? How did people react to you for instigating this?

Answer: No. II must say frankly I was never attacked personally with one exception and I'll tell
you that. Uh they tried probably to to get some dirt together, uh to collect some dirt uh but
obviously couldn't found anything in my police records. I had not stolen any where silver spoons or

so. I had not been a prisoner because I had uh uh committed fraud or or or uh embezzlement, so
obviously these attempts were in vain, so therefore in this respect I was never attacked. I was
attacked in the German press in another connection. I was, as I indicated before, a witness in a
couple of uh uh war...call it war crime trials. Uh the first was in Nuremburg against ss uh
where I was a witness and gave evidence especially against the man who was inchargeof_ sin
Auschwitz, Dr. __, who by the way was sent to prison but very soon released and very soon got
a terrific position again in German industry uh so uh uh then I was a witness in...when I was still in
Germany, against this film director who created a vicious poisonous anti-Semitic movie called

, the story of . And I had, must say this was used, which I found out only later, in
certain concentration camps to whip up the emotions, the anti-Semitic emotions of the of the guards
against us, so after I had seen it after the war, I said I wonder...I I'm surprised that anyone is still
alive after these people have seen it. It was heavy, very effective anti-Semitic stuff, and he was
accused in German court uh for crimes against humanity, but he could prove that he didn't
meant...that he didn't mean it and he was released from all charges. Uh as a matter of fact there was
one one case against him. Then there was was appeal and when I was asked as a witness again in
the second court trial, I sent a letter to the to the to the president of the court saying that I refused to
appear as a witness because I considered this would be an injury to the memory of my...of the of the
of the victims, that I have found that... didn't find that he had...that he had been a fair judge and I
refused to. Now it could have been dangerous at this time for me, but they didn't do that because
the the prosecutor was a friend mine, said listen, the fellow can...this judge can ask me to take you
into custody. I said alright. You know, in these days you did...I I dare...let him dare to do so, but
since he was himself, that judge a member of the Nazi party, I was assured that that something
could come out in the press. Then I was a witness uh in in in in a case for which I was brought over

from from America already against this fellow who was participating in the shooting of the of these
poor people on our way from Auschwitz to Mauthausen when they brought them down, and then
the last was in the second...so-called second Auschwitz trial in in in in Frankfurt uh against a man
whom I had observed making selections in Auschwitz, and he was accused in Auschwitz and then
the...my my lawyer with whom I had worked in the ___ case, uh told me uh you have to know that
the president of that court is a man who was active as a pilotinthe Legion __, that is the Legion
____ which was lent by the Nazis to the Spanish DeFranco (ph) and had participated, for instance,
in the bombing of . So he was uh uh...but obviously the the administration today thinks
that this this is nothing burdensome for him, so they made him a judge, and a judge in the
Auschwitz trial, so after I had given my evidence, and interesting enough the lawyer of that fellow
didn't ask one question because as my lawyer said, he knew that he probably would have made it
worse for his client, but the president, this this pilot ofthe Legion _, asked me, don't you have
anything good to say about the about the man who is accused here, so after I had recovered a little
bit from that question, I lashed out and I I really gave it...after all, I was at this time already an
American citizen and I had the American press there also, so so I felt strong, and I told him...I gave
him my indication what goodness means for SS people in in Auschwitz.

Question: What did you say, and repeat again which trial we're in now?

Answer: That was the trial against a man who had participated in selections of people for the gas
chambers, and and and and and I told him, I said what kind of goodness do you expect from
anybody who has become a slave of that criminal machinery which with with with the...which liked
to kill people everyday at whim, for whom any human being or every Jew was nothing but just

vermin (ph). What kind of goodness do we expect from them? So then at the end of it, interesting
enough, when the judgment was was rendered, I was considered as unfri...unfriendly witness. Now
after that, when I came back, I I asked a friend of mine who was writing articles for the Times and
so, that I had enough, that I would never accept an invitation again to go to give evidence before a
German court, and certainly this article found its way into into the German press, and was
re...reprinted there, and the uh there was a semi-Nazi paper in Germany called the and the
soldiers' paper. They picked it up and then they at...attacked me personally uh that I probably would
like to re-establish...I liked more the cause...the courts of and so on, and so but but the...I
didn't react to it. 11 1 I...because it was in the German press and I let it go, but I kept my promise. I
never...never appeared again uh in Germany before a German court.
Question: OK. I thank you. Tell us now...we have time...you said there were some things you had
wanted to tell us.
Answer: Are you asking about Leo Beck (ph), no.
Question: Yes. Yes. Yes. Do tell us about Leo Beck. You...you had a special...
Answer: Well, Leo Beck, Leo Beck was my...he was...was my teacher and my spiritual leader, if I
may say so. He was...he was the the head of the Jewish central organization, not because he was a
politician. He was far from that, but a man of impeccable moral and ethical attitude, uh who did not
only preach as uh preach ethics and and morale but also also practiced it and uh uh L..we got
together actually uh on a more personal basis when I was working uh at the beginning of the war for

the central organization in Berlin and when we had the first air attacks there by the British...by the
British uh uh air force, uh we were uh taking cover, or we had to take cover in a so-called air shelter
which was nothing, with no protection. Uh with the other members working in that office and very
often Leo Beck would...certainly came. He was a very, very uh disciplined worker and and uh uh
he uh he gave all the time to the Jewish work and I tell you in a moment why. Uh he was there and
we we were listening when the bombs were falling, and he told us well this is far or this is very
close or so. Why? Because he was one of the few with experiences of World War I. He had been
an Army rabbi, especially in in France, so he was familiar with with with the military...with military
practice, so he could teach us or could enlighten us if the bombs were deadly close to us or the ones
were far away so we didn't have to worry about it. Leo Beck was, for instance, a man uh when he
his wife died...1 think in 1938, sometime ___...uh he got offers from a lot of universities
outside...in England and America, to teach philosophy, to teach theology and so, and he refused and
his reaction was as long as one Jew needs me in Germany, | feel I have to stay with him, and as I
said before, he was not only preaching ethics and morale, he also practiced it. He stayed. He knew
what his destiny would be. Uh he was taken to Theresienstadt in March, I think, of 1943 or
February, but where...by by a miracle he survived and this is a very interesting miracle. He told us
this miracle when he came uh uh to Germany. You know, he was saved in Theresienstadt. He then
made his way with the help of the American army to his daughter in in London and then in '47, I
think, or '48, he came to visit uh Jewish communities in Germany. We needed him badly to give us
some some hope, some spiritual encouragement and uh uh then he...when we were sitting in a small
circle, he told...he was very...a very shy, a very private man. He didn't say a word about about about
what he did or what what some heroism or so, some heroic things or so, but he he said uh...

Question: I'm going to ask you really to repeat the word Leo Beck.

Answer: Yeah. Leo Beck was incarcerated in Theresienstadt, in ___—_—«.:~There was a practice in
____ that uh uh the name of famous people, let us say of leaders, of Jewish leaders from Austria,
from Czechoslovakia, and so who were all incarcerated in , who had to be reported to
Eichmann (ph) and he had a...was one of his bureaucratic whims he had...he had to know who of the
people he knew uh had had had had had died. And one day he was advised in one list that a rabbi
Leo Beck had died, and he thought it was the Leo Beck. Next to that name, nothing was mentioned
from which place this rabbi had come, but there was a rabbi Leo Beck in ____ in Czechoslovakia,
and he had died of old age. So when Eichmann came to Theresienstadt, to__—_, shortly before
the end of the war, ten days or twelve days before the Russians entered, he all of a sudden find uh
found Leo Beck there, and he was absolutely flabbergasted and in the words of Leo Beck he said,
Leo Beck. He said yes. He said wouldn't say rabbi or doctor or so...he said Leo Beck, what are you
doing here. He said . [understand you are dead, so Leo Beck who was a very courageous
man also and a witty man, said you know there is a saying amongst us that when you are...when you
are believed dead, you live double of your time. Now Eichmann did not have the courage anymore,
because it was ten days before the end, to let us say have him shot or have him...because...and he
couldn't certainly dis...have him deported to the east anymore, so he left it at that. And that is the
way, according to what I was told when we were together, how he had survived at Theresienstadt
and was saved by the Russian army and later a group of of, interesting enough, an American
colonel, of the __ family I think, made a special way when they heard about Leo Beck to
Theresienstadt to to take him out and by special plane he was flown, flown to London, so uh uh but

and there was also something else which L...and it's the last I want to say about him. In uh in
writings, especially also in the book of ____ about the banality of evil, there were very unfair text
against him, against Leo Beck, based on a story which I consider a historic lie. In 1945 a man who
had entered Germany with the American army and who wanted to make probably a quick buck,
wrote stories of survivors uh under the title "We Have Survived." And he published one story
which he published in such a way as if it was the writing by Leo Beck, but anybody who was
familiar with the writings of Leo Beck could see immediately that it was not his writing. And he
told of the story that Leo Beck had been advised in 1944 by somebody who had escaped Auschwitz
successfully, who had come to Theresienstadt to advise him that in Auschwitz people are being
gassed, and he kept it as a secret and did not make it known to the people around him. I personally
consider this as a I say, a historical lie. First of all, the number of people who succ...Jewish people
who successfully uh escaped Auschwitz, you can count on one or two hands of your of your of your
two fingers of your hand, but number two that a man would have the folly to escape as a Jew
successfully from Auschwitz, make his way into Theresienstadt, penetrate the the wires or the walls
or whatever it is, to look up especially Leo Beck and tell him, listen, I want you to know they are
gassing in Auschwitz. It's so absurd. I asked especially in the work I did for the...with the...after the
____, I went...I was...I met hundreds and thousands of fellow survivors, if that fellow heard about
somebody who had come from from Auschwitz and gone to Theresienstadt. They never heard
about it because it's absurd. It's abso...not only absurd. I would say it's obscene, but

picked it up and and and it is sticking in her book. I think somebody else also were picking it up,
but I consider it as...Leo Beck would not defend himself. He would not say a word about it. That
was not his system. Personal attacks he would ignore, because he knew who he was and he
then...he knew that others would speak for him. That's he agreed for _, but that he would say

and I'll write an article and make a statement and so and he wouldn't do it. And I say I I..-he was he
was he was absolutely he was he was a great man. Unfortunately uh uh his...you know, because he
lived at a time which was a terrible time, he could not live up to his full potential, you know, as a as
a spiritual leader, but whatever...whatever he wrote after...it's interesting. When we took
I remember, people told me when he came to London, and for the first time they asked him to speak
to the people and there was an overcrowded hall and they thought he would talk about something
about Theresienstadt. Not a word. He talked about _, about Moses Mendelson (ph), about
about whoever he wanted to, but not about Theresienstadt, because he doesn't...didn't want to be
want to be to give even the appearance of a hero who is a survivor. So may I say...may I close with
with this remark...everybody is reacting to this chapter differently, and and and and I'm glad that I
had the opportunity to to tell you. Probably I could cover hours and hours more of that, but it's my
belief that what what you are doing here and what the the Holocaust Museum is doing by putting
the archives together together is of tremendous importance and of tremendous value, irrespective of
the revisionists uh telling us Auschwitz was a hoax or like in that book of uh David Irvin (ph) with
pages and pages just tried to prove that Hitler did...never knew about the Holocaust. It was only...it
was only Himmler and the others, or the attempts to say just uh Hitler and Himmler and

are guilty, but all the others are...1 never believed in collective guilt, and we never
spoke about it, not even in Belsen after the war, but I also never believed in in collective innocence.
That means that we all have to try to learn a lesson. The Holocaust happened, unfortunately. What
could come out is that the world and especially those who luckily were safe from it, have to speak
out and have to to to to teach what can happen if human beings become become...or forget the
concepts of morale, of ethics, and especially that...and I think this is one of the tasks of that museum
and of that of that of that of your archives...to say to the world, look at what can happen. Therefore

bigotry is evil. Racism is evil. The the the uh damage of human rights is evil and anti-Semitism is
evil. It happened once and let us hope it will never happen again.
Question: Thank you.
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
Question: You had said that there were a couple of pieces of testimony that were particularly
compelling or a couple of incidents. Could you tell me about them?
Answer: Well, there were there were there were there was evidence from me from from me as a
plaintiff, but there was also testimony for the defendants. Now for the defendants, they had brought
in some people who gave them an accounting down to the last penny in a typical German/Prussian
way, why should not be held responsible because they actually lost on the slave labors
because they gave so and so much. Even that was too much because the capacity, the work
capacity was was nil and so he proved to the court that certainly should not be kept
responsible. On my side, you have interesting uh Mr. selected carefully very interesting
people. One friend of mine...unfortunately he's not around anymore...was a professor of medicine at
the University of Strasbourg, and he gave a very powerful statement. The other was a a a lawyer
who was I think a teacher at the Sorbonne in in Paris, and then there came three British prisoners of
war and uh told the court what they had seen and how they had reacted, and interesting enough the
court said in its verdict that uh to their to their regret, that none of the German uh uh witnesses they
could believe, that uh especially the British prisoners of war had made a deep impression on them,

and that uh I think this is a formula I don't uh get it verbatim, that the British prisoners of war had to
show the Germans how even under stretching circumstances, you can keep the values...human
values alive. And uh so that was a very important important uh argument to keep them responsible
and tell them you have to pay.
