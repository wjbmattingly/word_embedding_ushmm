GERHART RIEGNER
April 28, 1992

Q. Dr. Riegner, would you tell us your full name, and where and when you were born?
A. My name is Gerhart Riegner. Second name is Moritz. I was named after my grandfather. I
am born in Berlin. I am a real Berliner, as Kennedy would have said. And I am born on the 12th
of September, 1911.
Q. And could you tell us a little bit about what your life was like when you were growing up in
Berlin with your family, friends, the climate, so forth?\
A. Well, I come from a typical German Jewish family. And I would say that we belonged
already -- as Kurt Blumenfeld would have said -- to the post-assimilationist era. It is typical that
I am born in Berlin and that my two parents were also already born in Berlin. My grandparents
came from very typical German middle-sized cities. One grandfather was born in Magdeburg.
The other -- my grandmother was born in Halle. The second grandmother was born in
Neubrandenburg. And the other grandfather -- here we come already to the frontier towards
Poland -- in Niederschlesien, which is Silesia, the more German part of it. So 1am coming from
a long stock German family. We had in the family two traditions. On the one hand, a very
Jewish tradition. My grandmother, my mother's side, was a Lewandovsky. She was a niece of
Louis Lewandovsky, who was the creator of the modern synagogue music, and some of the most
beautiful modern melodies originate from him. His son-in-law was the famous philosopher,
Hermann Cohen, the founder of the Marburgerschule of the school of Neo-Kantianism. He was

one of the few full professors under the Kaiserreich in the old style. He came from very Jewish
origins. He studied the Talmud. He went to the Jewish theological seminary in Breslau before
he became a philosopher. And he is the author not only of great works and the reinterpretation
of Kant, but also of religious philosophy, of work in religious philosophy, based on the sources
of Judaism, "die Religion der Vernunft." This is a great man in my family, whom I knew as a
child. And where -- every Sunday we went for lunch to my grandparents' andfor coffee or tea to
Cohen's. And in Cohen's house, which was very near that of my grandparents', every Sunday
there was a great party, sixty, fifty, sixty persons. And the old man was nearly blind, was in the
rocking chair, like Kennedy, with white, wonderful white hair, and the blue dark glasses, was
presiding over -- what should I call it? Holding court, if you want. He was really nice to us
children. He played with us, and -- but before all, I knew that he was an important man.
I see him still in the synagogue on -- Simchas Torah. 01:10 In 1917, I was six years old, when
he walked directly behind the rabbi with the little Torah, very light because he was not so very
strong any more. And he looked like an old Jewish prophet, with his fantastic great face, his
white locks, and he gave the impression of a real leader of a religious movement.
Q. But you knew he was also an important man in the country in terms of his academic
standing?
A. He was fighting anti-Semitism. And he spoke out from 1879, when the famous attacks by
Treitschke, the historian, and Stoecke, the priest and the official Dompraediger of the empire,
attacked the Jews. And he was himself, by the way, the victim of many anti-Semitic attacks, and
was -- had never a call from another university -- this is also very interesting -- and was fighting

for his pupils to get appointed as professors, and had one defeat after the other in this respect.
Even a man like Ernst Gerschieler, as great as his name was in this country -- was his most
important pupil probably -- couldn't get in Marburg, the Privatdozenten, and so on. Now, this is
the one -- and here, the one source of my Jewish background which was perhaps in myself
stronger than in the family itself. And this was due to the general climate in Germany. My first
anti-Semitic experience was on the second day of school, when I went to school in 1917, and
somebody called me "ein dreckiger Judenluemmel," dirty Jew boy -- something. And I -- this
was my first anti-Semitic experience. And I reacted immediately, not very intelligently. But I
couldn't not react. And I replied "dreckiger Christenbengel," which wasn't very intelligent. But I
did not accept the attack. My second experience was an experience of social anti-Semitism, in
school, when a good friend of mine, who was also a son of a lawyer, never succeeded in inviting
me to his home.
Q. You mean he tried, but his parents wouldn't allow it?
A. Yes. It was a tragedy with which I fought three years, each time finding another excuse why
they didn't invite me, until I finally understood why. Now, all this happened in a Germany in
which there was a strong anti-Semitic movement. I come to it in a moment when I speak about
the political background.
Q. Allright.

A. But I remember, for instance, the day on which Rathenau was assassinated, in 1922. I was
not yet eleven years old. And I remember the day my mother was in the clinic and we visited
her. She had some operation -- I don't remember what it was -- and it shook us to the
foundations. This was the great German Jewish patriot, who, in 1918, at the end of the war, was
the only one to suggest that the war was lost "Levee en masse" — the popular resistance
movement -- a Jew who had the courage to do this -- was the organizer of the whole economic
administration of raw materials during the four years of the first World War, for Germany. A
really great German patriot, no doubt about it, who had immense merit, from the German point
of view —
Q. He was a very able man.
A. -- to have organized it. And he was, as a minister of foreign affairs, killed by "voelkische,"
racist people. I will never forget this. This -- and in this whole -- this whole movement, there
were at least three, four, five others -- I am not speaking even of Hitler -- the first revolt in 1924.
But in every election we had it, and you felt it, and you saw it, and we were very noisy. Now I
come to the other side. My family was very interested in politics. My father was associated
since 1910 with a member -- the socialist member, a prominent socialist who became a member
of the Reichstag, who was during the revolution in 1918 a member of the provisional Prussian
government, minister of justice, and who became one of the great fighters against the death
penalty in Germany.
Q. Kurt Rosenfeld?

A. Kurt Rosenfeld, yes. My father was not a socialist. My father was a very socially minded
democrat. Perhaps more social than the Socialist Party, deeply -- but didn't believe in Marxism,
and so on, but he had a very great social conscienceness. He was a typical product of his time,
where the idea of "allgemeine Bildung," universal knowledge, universal education, was the great
idea towards which a great part of German Jewry attended. He was very close to Cohen, who
considered him as his preferred nephew, who had no children, and, therefore, the close
relationship. He was in reality very knowledgeable in German literature. When he died, I heard
him -- and the last time I saw him and -- lying on his bed -- declaiming for hours verses from
Goethe's Faust, from Heine's "Lieder," and so on. You know, this is human. At the end of the
life, the souvenirs of the young years come out very, very strongly -- that remain, years full of
German "Bildung." He was a great connoisseur of art. In his old years he even wrote books on
art and articles. Where he didn't succeed to write about European art -- to publish it in America, I
gave him the idea to write for a -- European publications about American art, and he published a
series of modern American art. It was very appreciated. He was at home in many ways in many
fields of human knowledge and endeavors. As I said, he was a lawyer. And he was even very
esteemed amongst his colleagues. He was what is called a member -- elected as a member of the
"Vorstand der Anwaltskammer," which is the chamber of lawyers, where all the lawyers elect
their own disciplinary courts and instances. And he got in Berlin the largest number of votes
amongst the lawyers, which -- for a man who was very modest -- and so this was quite
remarkable. My mother was also active in politics. She became active in education of women
and information of women as citizens of the country. She gave lectures and courses to -- in
women's schools about the responsibility, civil responsibility of women. She became a very

active member of the Democratic Party and belonged to the enlarged Bureau of the party, went
out taking -- making speeches at all elections, and so on. So you see here, there was a political
atmosphere, both from my parents and from associates of my father. This was the other part. I
was deeply interested in politics all my life. And I saw the disappearance, slow disappearance of
the democratic republic. I had mentioned today when Rathenau was assassinated. I remember
the day when the first president of the republic died. I took part in the 1925 -- I think, in the
funeral in the Lustgarten with the hundreds of thousands of people. And I felt already then
somehow instinctive whether we hadn't already buried the republic there. And all the more when
Hindenburg, to our great disappointment, was elected president. And -- which was, of course, a
terrible regressive step from the point of view of democracy. This all I lived very intensely and
followed very intensely. And I saw with growing fear what was happening, and the great uccess
of the racist and Nazi movements. I finished my school in 1929 with a very good examination. I
went my first term -- I followed in the University in Freiburg im Breisgau -- was my first being
outside the house and on my own. I continued in Berlin. I went again the next summer to
Heidelberg, which was perhaps the greatest experience in my university life. This was the
Heidelberg of -- where people teaching, like Jaspers and Anschutz and Ratbur and Gundolf, and
-- you name it, Tibelius. This was really the summit of German intellectual life, and it marked
me very much. Even if I have been forced to separate slowly from the identification with the
German people -- and you were, by the rejection which you felt -- always more separating
yourselves from this milieu, from this concept of belonging to the German people. This was, in
any case, one of the great culminating points of my life, which I will never forget. And I owe
very much to this cultural activity, to this expression of German culture, especially in
Heidelberg. I am not speaking of the other place, of course. Berlin at that time, of the Weimar

Republic, was an enormously cultivated life, theater, opera -- I took part in all this fully, and I
belonged to the Volksbuehne subscribers. I saw the most modern theater, plays, and so on, and
so on. But I was very conscious about -- as I said, about the going-down of the republic. When I
was a student, I joined the Association of the Republican Students. And this was not an accident.
In Baden, where both the University in Freiburg and in Heidelberg were located, there were still
student elections. In Prussia, these elections for the student representation at universities had
already been suppressed because the Nazis had gained large majorities all over. But in Baden it
was still allowed. And I took part in the student elections in my first term, in my third term,
made speeches, organized, cooperated at that time with people -- very interesting people. Our
patron was an old German professor, von Schuelze-Gevanitz. His son was later a consul in
Zurich -- very important consul, by the way. Schuelze-Gevenitz was an economist, a sociologist,
a very wonderful human being. And one of the students with whom I cooperated then was a man
who became very famous, had a very sad life, was Schulze Baeusen. He had just joined the
democratic movement, coming from the Jungdeutsche Orden. He ended as a Communist, was
one of the founders of the Rote Kapelle -- the Red Chapel, which he organized from the minister
of defense residence. A fantastic fellow, I must say. We worked together in the elections in
1929. I would never have expected that he would go so far to the right and to be so true to his
ideals. Anyhow, you see that I was involved in this. I was also involved in Heidelberg. But
there -- this was 1930. There I already separated somehow and visited regularly the Zionist
groups. I never joined the Zionist student groups, but I had many friends there, and even raveled
on some of their excursions, winter excursions in the mountains. I joined them, was skiing with
them together. And I was very much attracted by the Zionist —

Q. Let me interrupt for a second. Would it be fair to say that as of roughly this time, near 1930,
you are still balancing in your mind the dual loyalty of being German and Jewish and trying to
figure out for yourself what are the problems and where does one have to come down?
A. Well, I came certainly -- I started certainly as a conscious German, but deeply offended as a
Jew by what happened to the Jews. And was struggling first to defend it from inside, and then I
saw more and more that this didn't work. And so my way of retreating from identification with
the German nation became more and more clear. I think this is as far as I can get it, but I think
this is the right description. And when I finished my studies -- by the way, I would say that here,
also, I am far from being only a jurist, only legacy. I was deeply involved in all kinds of other
things. I followed especially the historians, Ongden, for instance, in Berlin. I followed
philosophers, Jaspers, Spengler, was deeply involved in all kinds of other art, history, and so on.
The ideal of universal Bildung, which I learned, so to speak, with the milk of my mother -- in the
family, it was deeply working on me. And I took it over from my father, from my parents. And
I was never one-sided. Even in my whole Jewish career, you will find in my library sections on
philosophy and history and on economy and you name it. And I used my university years to the
full to get involved and educated in many other fields. Now, I finished my studies with the
so-called "Referendar" Exam. This is the first great examination after three, three and a half
years of study. And I got a very good result, and was then named in the first days of 1933 as
"Referendar," which is a kind of assistant to a judge, if you want. It's really the practical years,
where you use what you have learned in a practical way. You spend time at different tribunals at
various degrees in the administration, and as a lawyer, and so on. And I was in the first stage of
this. I was at the Amtsgericht Weding. It's the largest tribunal of the first instance in Berlin.

And I wrote the judgments for the judge, which he signed. And active in all kinds of legal
assistance, and so on, wrote what was asked for in this position. Then came Hitler to power the
30th of January, 1933. And this, of course, gave us a terrible shock. All the more --
Q. You did not expect it?
A. Yeah. But here I would say, in the November elections, '32, you know, during that year, we
had -- I don't know -- three, four elections. In the November elections the Nazi party for the first
time had lost more than a million of votes. And it looked at that moment that it was not
absolutely necessary. And the whole thing that he got into the place as chancellor was an
intrigue started by the people around the president, Hindenburg, because of some of the scandals
in the eastern Prussia. And then Papen and the other reactionary politicians combined in order, in
a great miscalculation, to bring about the coalition between the Deutsch Nationale Volkspartei
and the Nazi parties, believing that they would dominate Hitler, which was, of course, ridiculous
from the point of view of political judgment. When Hitler came to power, I was very soon
convinced that this was a decisive point in the history of Germany, and I was very soon
convinced that they would not give up power, and that this would lead to terrible persecutions for
the Jews. I was a little -- we come back to this -- a number of these Nazi manifestations, and so
on, on the 30th of January, when he took power, and the Ist of April, and the Boycott, and so on.
And I decided to leave Germany. We were under an illusion. We didn't know the world outside.
We didn't realize how deeply the economic crisis had worked. We thought that first the younger
generation should get out and then the older should follow. But the chance to build up a new

existence for the younger generation was practically nil. I would have liked to go then to
Palestine. The Zionist ideal, as I already said, worked very strongly on me.
Q. Excuse me a second. Were there any specific events that precipitated your decision to leave,
or was this just your general impression after Hitler had taken power —
A. Well, I think it was the general understanding of what was happening. Practically -- I will
just give you an example. On the Ist of April, when I was suspended as "Referendar," as the
functionary of the tribunal, the same day my father was suspended as a lawyer, the same day my
older sister, who was a teacher at the Lycee in Frankfurt am Main, was suspended as a teacher,
my youngest sister, who was still in school, was thrown out from school. So out of a family of
five -- my mother didn't exercise any profession as she was a good housewife at the time. She
was a teacher by profession, and she took on again after my father didn't earn any money any
more. She became again a teacher in the Jewish schools and was teaching then. The existence
of four of five of our family was completely put upside down. This was -- but this accompanied
my reason. Of course, if I wouldn't have been thrown out the Ist of April, maybe I would have
taken longer to decide. Although I was only suspended, and I could have waited. But I knew
this was a definite throwing-out. So I didn't wait. I waited a little bit, because on the same Ist
of April, in the evening, there was a -- we had rented a little house outside of Berlin because my
father was not in good health at the time and the doctors had prescribed him he should be more --
in the fresh air and not running too much from one tribunal to the other. We had rented a house
in the neighborhood of Berlin. And the evening -- and we were the only Jews there, no other
Jewish family at all. And at ten o'clock in the evening that day, there was what they called

"Sprechchor," "Juda Verrecke, Juda Verrecke, Juden 'raus." This was an anti-Semitic local
group of the Nazi party which made itself felt for twenty minutes or so. My parents were in
town, visited some friends. And I was alone in that house with my younger sister. I was in the
bath. I felt like Marat. What will happen now? But I didn't make any movements, kept quiet,
and after twenty minutes they disappeared. But it incited me not to leave immediately, to wait
whether there would be other such demonstrations. It didn't happen. And I left in the middle of
May. I said I wanted to go -- would have liked to go to Palestine. I was very much attracted by
it, but I knew you had to go to a kibbutz. And -- which was very beautiful, but not for
everybody. And knowing that I was very individualistic, I knew that this wouldn't work with
me. Two of my best friends decided it, and it didn't work. They went, and they left afterwards,
and finally ended in America. And my judgment was right. And as I was a quite good lawyer
and very interested in, especially the philosophical side of law, what's called jurisprudence,
theory of law and state -- this comes and joins with my political interests, of course. I decided to
continue my law studies. I went to Paris, and made my legal examinations again in Paris,
Licenscie en Droit -- of the Sorbonne. And but here, something which happened -- which I
should perhaps say. A few days before I left, I got a message from one of the most famous
professors of jurisprudence, of public law in the University of Berlin, Rudolf Schwent [ph]. It so
happened that in my second term he admitted me into his seminar. Why he did this, I -- to this
day I don't know, because ninety percent of the people who were there were postgraduate.
Maybe he wanted a few youngsters who could make work and -- which he couldn't do. I don't
know. In any case, I made a communication, and -- it was very interesting -- on "Die Wandlung
des Rechtsstatsbegriffs". It's not an accident, by the way. "The changes in the concept of the
state based on law." And this communication was an expose, as very well received. You know,

it wasn't very original. When you are in this young stage of life, you have two choices: Either
you get a very bright idea, or you use your working capacities and work very hard. And as I
didn't have especially a bright idea, I worked very hard, and I found out where the notion of
"Rechtsstat" appears the first time in the 18th Century literature -- not in Kant. I forgot even the
name. I have it somewhere. And this made a great impression on Schmendt because this wasn't
known. It's, by the way, not known because it's never published. And he somehow learned
through a cousin of mine -- my name is not so frequent -- asked what I be -- what I become, and
so on. And when he heard I am leaving for France, he asked me to come and see him. And for
three hours, two and a half hours, he tried to persuade me not to leave. "Das kann doch nicht so
bleiben." "This cannot remain like this." "You know that I am a German nationalist. But with
these people this cannot last. This is an episode. In six months --" Well, the young student -- or
whatever you call him -- was more intelligent in this respect than the professor. I told him that I
was convinced that this was the end, and I had to build up a_new life and had to leave. It's
interesting. This, by the way, I -- although we were politically and even philosophically really
on the extreme different positions, I am a great adherer of -- that the theory of Hans Genz -- I
will come to it in a moment -- who was just at the opposite end of theologic -- theopolitical
concept. I nevertheless got a very warm memory of him. He is the only German who ever
cared for me after I left. This is one of the things which nobody will ever tell you. I was
twenty-one years when I left. I had friends, I had comrades in school, I had mates in the
University, I have studied in three universities, I knew hundreds of people. I was active in everal
university student groups, and so on. Not one German ever wrote me a postcard after I left
Germany. Not one German ever asked what I had become. With the exception of this professor.
The lack of courage of the German intelligentsia was unbelievable. They didn't want to be

involved. A Jew is outside -- was already something like treason, and an act of revolt against the
system. So they didn't want to have anything to do with them. But what humanly this means --
that nobody ever asked for you, nobody ever sent you a postcard, nobody ever gave you a sign of
life -- is something which I will never forget. And Schwendt wrote to me because he wanted to
publish this communication I had made in a seminar. He thought it was deserving of publishing.
And as it was not possible -- this is also important to know -- to publish -- as a Jew to publish in
Germany, you couldn't publish any more. He tried, but it was impossible, to publish it in
Austria. This was before the Anschluss. He didn't succeed. But he tried at least. And I will
never forget this. It's an interesting part of my story, but it is also a very sad part of my story.
Now, I did go to Paris -- and we were allowed in Paris -- you hadn't to go to the lectures in the
universities. We could present ourselves to the examinations. And I passed the three
examinations as soon as I could. And when I passed the second examination in the beginning of
'34, probably spring, March probably, the French Barreau, the lawyers in Paris, got terribly
scared of the -- I don't know -- forty, maybe fifty, young Jewish refugees who took up the law in
France. They were so scared -- but to a certain degree they were right. We were very good
lawyers. We were a very good group. And only people who really meant and were involved and
deeply involved in the profession went on with this. But after all -- thousands of lawyers in
France. Forty or fifty Jewish lawyers would have disturbed their career? And they pushed
through a law in the French Parliament which barred any foreigner from the exercise of the legal
profession until ten years after naturalization. Now, as it took five years to get naturalized as a
minimum, fifteen years meant you are out. And this was in the summer of '34 I was faced with
what to do. And I decided -- I wasn't really -- very unclear there. In the summer there was -- at
the Sorbonne -- one of them who was the most eminent legal philosophers of our time gave three

lectures in Paris at the Sorbonne. After the second lecture, I took my courage into my hands and
went up to him and asked him for advice. I had corresponded with him as a chutzpadik young
student twice. And he immediately remembered this, which I was very surprised. He was --
every great man wants to have pupils, you know, and is, of course, flattered. And said
immediately, "Come to Geneva." So I said, "Well, it's not so easy, you know." I depended
practically on the -- what an uncle of mine who was living in Holland gave me as a kind of
contribution monthly to make my living. I was really proud that after a few months in Paris I got
the first Bourse fellowship from the Alterad [ph] Universitaire Internationale. As a matter of
fact, the only case where a man who had got a fellowship from the Alterad Universitaire
Internationale, became later a president of the Alterad Universitaire Internationale. Anyhow, I
told him, "It's not so easy." He said, "You can last four or five months?" I said, "Yes, I can."
He said, "Come. And after four months, you had got -- four, five months, a good lawyer, know
you, he get you a fellowship, and after a year, you renew the fellowship for the next two years.
Nothing will happen to you." And this is more or less how it happened. I finished my
examination. I went to Geneva. I got after four or five months a fellowship. And -- which was
renewed and I had still -- I think thirteen months of fellowship, which, as a refugee, is an ideal
thing. This is unheard of. You don't know -- that you don't have to be preoccupied with your
future. So I was in Geneva, and here starts now the beginning of my career. I was not looking
for any job. But while I was studying and doing postgraduate work, really, what it was, in
Geneva -- Stephen Wise and Nahum Goldman decided to create in the autumn of or the summer
1936 the World Jewish Congress. And they turned to three professors, whether they couldn't
recommend to them a young international lawyer. Because the program of the World Jewish
Congress at that time was two-fold: on the one hand, to fight against Hitler; on the other hand, to

support and defend the interests of the large Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. Practically
all disappeared today -- in Poland, in Romania -- three and a half million in Poland, there were a
million in Romania. And all these eastern European countries after the Treaty of Versailles had
to accept the minority treaties and the protection of minorities under the guarantee of the League
of Nations. There was a whole procedure for these things, and the Congress needed somebody
who could write the briefs, and so on, and know the procedures. And those three professors to
whom they turned, they all recommended me. I don't know why. Especially William Rappard
(ph), who was the director of the institute, member of the Mandates Commission, old friend of
Weizmann, of Goldman, and so on, and with whom I had never discussed Jewish affairs, but he
knew apparently that I was Jewishly interested.
Q. Iam going to ask you more about the three professors, because they become later -- at least a
couple of them -- become important later, but they're about to run out of tape, so let's take a
quick break right here.
A. But it's all right?
Q. Yeah. I think we're --

A. Or is it too long, too detailed?
TAPE #2
Q. Dr. Riegner, you were telling us about the events that led to your being hired as a
representative of the World Jewish Congress in Switzerland.
A. Yeah. This is even -- too much said. I was asked to become the man who deals with the
international legal problems under the system of the minority treaties at the League of Nations.
Now, as I told you, the three professors who were approached all recommended me -- without
telling me, by the way. And then Goldman approached me. He was at the time a representative
of the Jewish Agency at the League of Nations. And there was a mandate system, as you know,
but Palestine was one of the mandates. And there was a permanent Mandate Commission which
supervised the application of the mandate provisions by the mandatory powers, and he
represented the Jewish agency vis-a-vis this organ in Geneva. And he knew as such Rappard,
who was one of the professors. Rappard was a very fine, liberal personality. He was teaching in
Harvard in -- I think in 1911, a Swiss professor, who became a friend of Wilson. And it was due
to his relations with Wilson that the League of Nations came to Geneva in 1919. He was a very
important personality in Swiss politics, became later a Member of Parliament. But he was very
respected as an international figure, one of the great international figures the Swiss had at the
time, was presiding at the International Labor Conference, was one of the representatives at the
League of Nations, and so on. And he was the first director of the Mandates Commission, of the
mandates section in the League of Nations secretariat, and became later a member of the

mandates Commission, when he gave up this job and was a very great friend of the Jews and
supported us against the White Paper of Britain in 1939, was a friend of great admiration of Dr.
Weizmann. He represented the Geneva University at the laying of the founding stone of the
Jerusalem University in 1925. He was there when Weizmann gave Balfour the great play on this
occasion, and told us about it a number of times. Anyhow, he was a -- really a great liberal and a
great friend of ours, and he -- in his institute, International -- the Graduate Institute of
International Relations was one of the places which received refugees from Italy against the
Mussolini Fascist state and supported them and allowed them to study there. And he did the
same when the Nazis came to power. And we were in Geneva a large group of very gifted
Jewish refugees and Italian refugees. And also, we had wonderful professors there: a great
historian, Guglielmo Ferrero, the historian, was there as historian; there was Roepke, economist,
a liberal economist who left Germany under Hitler; Weberg, who was an old pacifist who was
teaching there; Kanzel who had taught in Jena; later, Rathenau, when he founded the University
of Cologne and brought him to Cologne, was one of the first to be denaturalized by Hitler. And I
could continue —And there were at the same time a good number of students of this type which
were supported by fellowships which came partly from Rockefeller and partly from the Swiss
government. And in any case, it was an extremely lively and interesting institute which --
created really in the tradition of preparing people for positions in international life. Many went
to various international organizations. Many went to the foreign services in their countries, and
soon. Now, when Nahum Goldman approached me, as I said, I didn't look for any job. I was in
a wonderful situation. And I really didn't want to change my outlook. I often said that I was
very interested in public law, state law, state and -- normally I would probably, without Hitler,
have aimed at becoming a professor of jurisprudence at one of the universities. I hadn't given

this up when I was in Geneva. But the group which Wise and Goldman headed -- and this I
knew because it was a public knowledge -- was the only group -- Jewish group which was really
fighting Hitler. This is, without contest, the only group. They had already called three
preparatory conferences, the first in 32, before Hitler came to power. In the summer of '32, six
months before Hitler came to power, is the first international conference of the World Jewish
Congress -- before it became a permanent organization. And there were two other such
conferences, and they had gotten quite important publicity and it was known what they were
trying. So I was aware that this was the only Jewish group. And it was so much in the line
which I was educated and brought up, that I said to myself, "You cannot refuse it. I will give this
group three, four years of my life." That was the idea. But I happen to tell you, I got stuck with
the World Jewish Congress. I am there now for more than fifty-five years.
Q. Sometimes three or four years can be a long time.
A. It's a long time of three, four years, yeah. And then, of course, I often ask myself, "Was it
the right decision or not?" Of course, I often ask myself, especially when in such a position you
have to do many things you don't want to do. You come here for the certain ideal. You come to
do certain things politically, but you have to deal with this bureaucracy and this administration,
and so on, which is not what stimulates you very much. So | often ask myself, "Was it right?
Should I have not continued? Should I --" Well, of course, the fact that I remained is the answer
to the question. I was fascinated by it and it didn't leave me. It didn't -- the characteristic of --
the most important aspect was that from time to time the subjects with which I had to deal
changed completely. It was a fight against Hitler. There was the rescue effort in the war. There

was the rehabilitation of Jewish communities and the fight for Israel after the war. There was the
problem of North African Jewry, who are completely outside of our normal considerations,
which came then. And so a completely different aspect followed, the one, the others, and which
all deserved support and great concentration of labor. And so I came from one to the others and
couldn't stop. On the other hand, I must have -- could say, also, it gave me great opportunities
even in the field in which I was educated. I worked with great enthusiasm as a representative of
the World Jewish Congress at the United Nations and the Human Rights Commission, and so on,
in the efforts for the elaboration of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. I contributed to
some of the formulations. I worked on the formulation of the covenants on human rights, the
two covenants, international -- on the international convention against racial discrimination, on
the conventions of the INO and of the UNESCO, discrimination in occupation and
discrimination in education. I was part of the effort to redefine the whole new humanitarian law.
I participated in Stockholm in the International Red Cross Conference, and it was prepared -- I
was an observer and participant in the international conferences on the new international law, the
Red Cross law, in 1949 in Geneva. I participated in the new efforts in the seventies. I presided
at a commission of fifty international organizations to formulate a united approach to the revision
in the new International Red Cross protocols, which were later adopted. And so I had hundreds
of -- what shall I say -- occasions to use my knowledge and my tradition. But it was, of course,
not the center. It was one of the things which I did. But I must have found sufficient satisfaction
to continue, and, in fact, the work gave the answer to my question, which doesn't say that I don't
regret that I haven't written this or that book which I was -- always been dreaming of. Now, I
said I couldn't refuse this, I said. And I accepted and gave up my career. And then I am now for
fifty-five years in this role.

Q. Well, perhaps you could tell us a bit more about your impressions of Stephen Wise and
Nahum Goldman as you encountered them in 1936.
A. Well, let me put it this way: In the summer, Nahum Goldman hadn't to offer me anything.
He just found out whether I was ready to. And I didn't commit myself either -- myself, either.
Because he hadn't to -- he couldn't know anything. The organization had first to be established,
and then they had to establish the executive, and then they could act concretely. So he asked me,
though, to write for him a brief, wanted to see how I would do it. And he gave me some file, and
asked me, "Perhaps you can write a memorandum about this, how you would put it."." Which I
did, and which must have been satisfactory. And we left that summer. And my family was still
in Germany. And we met usually in the summer on the invitation of my uncle in Holland. And
we went and spent two weeks in Noordwijk aan Zee, a very nice place, where I met my family.
And one day I got a telegram from Nahum: "Come back immediately. We need you for the
preparation of the Congress." Not a permanent offer, but -- so I took the next train and spent I
think thirty-three hours in the -- still wooden compartment in the old European trains, and arrived
in Geneva, where Goldman wasn't -- he wasn't on board. And there was another chaotic bureau
which gave me an enormous dossier and asked me to write a brief, a memorandum for the
assembly, the first World Jewish Congress assembly, which was to meet in a week's time. And
they wanted me to give for the participants a memo -- outlining what policy, in my opinion, we
should continue. It was on the German Jewish refugee problem, of which I was, of course, very
much aware. But that doesn't mean I had specially studied these things from a legal point of
view. And I prepared fresh from vacation in a few days a very -- a very, very good paper, which

Lused myself years later to look up. When I finished it, they asked me to write two other papers
about some other problems, the problem of Danzig, the problem of Upper Silesia. And then the
Congress started. And nobody talked to me, and I was just there. And so there was great chaos,
as always in such things, and I -- as a very orderly person, I tried to make some order in helping
in the secretariat, and didn't mind whether -- to do -- they give us small things and big things, but
-- they made me secretary of two great commissions, one on the German Jewish problem and
one on the minority treaties and problem with international protection. And there I saw for the
first time Wise and Goldman in action. Now, Wise was the Good great moral figure of the
movement, a fantastic orator, a wonderful voice. I know people who went to his sermons only to
follow -- to learn the English -- the beauty of his English. He was really a fighter not only for the
Jews but for all great human causes. It's not an accident he supported the movement against
child work -- what you call it? \
Q. Child labor?
A. Hmm?
Q. Child labor?
A. Yeah. Child labor. He was supporting the women's movement. He was supporting the
Czech independence movement. He was supporting the Greek. He was really -- and the Negro.
He was very, very active in fighting the fight for the equalization of the Negro -- the status of the

Negro in this country. He was really the great liberal, moral figure in the movement, and he was
the first to have started the resistance against Hitler. When I was still in Germany, I knew -- he
made headlines in the Nazi press. You can find a number of -- which I still saw in Germany.
They called him the "Rabbiner Wiese." Wiese, not Wise. Wiese. He was really public enemy
number one for them. Both in Goebbel's Angriff and Voelkischer Beobachter there were
numerous cases where he made the headline on the first page. And I knew this. I had seen it.
This was one of the reasons that I saw that he was really the one who was fighting against them.
And he remained also a great moral figure. He never gave up the fight, even in the worst times.
He was a man who -- of unusual patience, open to every Jew who had some complaint. He was
sometimes criticized that he wasted his time in doing this instead of concentrating on -- but he
couldn't. He loved -- not the Jewish people. He loved every Jew. It's something which you --
you don't find today anymore in this way, very rarely it is. He was very courageous. You know
that he was a liberal rabbi, although in the end he came a little back, moderated some of his
liberal convictions. I saw him officiate with a kippah in -- at marriages, and so on, which in
earlier days he didn't do. It was a whole Hebraization process, and so on, in the reform
movement. But he was, on the other hand, a man who had been the first to go to the Zionist
Congress in 1989 -- in '98 sic. [Dr. Riegner means 1897] He quoted in one of the great speeches,
the last speech he made to the Congress in '48, the year before he died, in the Montreal
Assembly, when he recalled this encounter with Herzl, six weeks after the state was founded.
And he quoted Herzl: "I will not see the Jewish state, but you will see the Jewish state," and so
on. It was unbelievable when he quoted this. He was not a great intellectual. He was a great
moral figure. The intellectual was Nahum Goldman, absolutely brilliant. And one of the
greatest speeches he ever made was a speech at the opening of the assembly in 1936. You read it

today -- although it was even also a little bit censored because he couldn't -- you had to be in
some ways careful with regard to certain diplomatic necessities. I finally formulated some of the
corrections. But this is a great speech. So there he came out and made a formidable impression
on the audience. He was, as I said, brilliant. And we've come to the problems of rescue, and so
on. We'll have to come back to some of these aspects. He saw the essential. He could formulate
the essential in very short sentences, but what he then extracted was really the essence. And he
had -- I believe opinions that was later -- he was a maverick. He was provoking in the last years
of his life -- intentionally in order to get reaction and to educate the people like that. The old
rabbis of old -- he wanted to have this impact on the people, that they should think. But he was a
very highly intelligent man, very brilliant. I have once written a piece on the occasion of the first
Jahrzeit, where I called him the Renaissance Jew, a new Renaissance man. Renaissance, in
every respect. A Renaissance personality, and was all what the Renaissance Mensch
represented, and he was -- open and extremely wide interest, and so on. And on the other hand, a
man of the Jewish Renaissance, of course, in the Zionist movement. He was the brain, and Wise
was the conscience.
Q. You mentioned so far that you hadn't yet agreed to take a permanent job.
A. Yeah.
Q. When did you realize --
A. Well, as a matter of fact -- yeah. I will tell you the story, too. And as a matter of fact, I
helped in all kinds of things during the assembly, and I was taken in -- there was -- this I felt,

there was a great movement born. And the people were quite impressive people. I mean, they
are all dead today. And nobody knows about them. But it is astonishing how many great
characters came to the movement and each of them had a history of himself. It's difficult now to
remember them. I spoke at the 50th anniversary of the World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem, and
I named a few of them. A man -- Rabbi Rubensteiner Willner, was a member of Parliament,
with the Polish Parliament, very great Orthodox Jew, a very great personality. Take a man --
Anselm Reich -- Reich and Aldi Tartakover. They came from the labor movement. Reichs
pronounced in the -- or read in the Congress of 1936 on behalf of the whole Polish delegation a
declaration accusing the Polish government. This had never happened before. Usually in Zionist
Congresses, the Hungarians accuse the Poles, and the Czechs the Romanians, and so on, but this
is -- distributed roles. But here was a man of enormous courage to do it himself for the whole
Polish delegation. Take -- there were so many. | -- it's very -- really very difficult to name them
today. The old people from Romania. The -- there were the -- from all the Baltic states, from --
but the Congress, the personalities was very, very impressive. But on the other hand, Western
Europe was very underrepresented, and America was underrepresented, and we didn't succeed at
the time to really have the majority of the Western European communities. The Bungdorf (ph)
deputies of England decided with a vote of six, a majority of six, to refuse the cooperation of the
Doily (ph). And this was, of course, a great tragedy. But here was a colossal potential. And
they -- I think we -- it's unbelievable today that the unit of the Jewish people and the joint action
of Jews is such a normal thing, that we have established it, how this was bitterly fought in the
three years before the World War II started. And there the war has completely changed the
attitude of the Jews. And the Jews in the Western countries followed their government. They
followed the policies, the wrong policies of their government, the appeasement policies of their

government, and didn't stand up, and here was one of the great lost opportunities. I don't know
whether we could have changed the tragedy, the events. But at least we should have -- should
have tried. And while today, even a young youth doesn't understand it, this opposition, and the
denouncing of the people who had the courage to stand up and preach for the united Jewish
approach and the common fight against Hitler. Finally, when the Congress was over, the next
day the executive met, which had been elected the day before. And there, the decisions on
offices, and so on, came up. There Nahum Goldman proposed my being selected for the Geneva
office. And very interesting: There was great opposition. All the people with whom I became
very friendly later, other Jews -- the opposition was, "But he doesn't speak Yiddish." And Nahum
Goldman apparently -- I wasn't at the meeting. I was told later -- he said, "Well, I need him at
the League of Nations. There they don't speak Yiddish, either. They speak French. They speak
English. And this he does." But this didn't make any -- any -- any impression -- and then the
only German Jew who was there in the new, elected executive was Georg Bernhardt. Georg
Bernhardt was a former member of the Reichstag, editor-in-chief of the Voelkischer Zeitung,
which was one of the great German, liberal newspapers. He was a professor at the high
commercial school, a university in Berlin. He had a number of other high positions. And he was
the leader of the German Jewish immigration at that time in Paris, editor of the Pariser Tageblatt,
and the uncontested president of the German Jewish immigrant society. And he stood up, and
said -- as I was told later -- he said, "But he comes from a very, very, very good Jewish family."
Now, that did it. There was no argument. Yiddish you can learn, but a good family, you can't --
you must have, or you don't have. And apparently this convinced the people. Very funny, but so
it happened. So I entered the office on the 1st of September, I think, 1936, in an office which
didn't exist really, which I had to create. And with no budget, with a lot of debts. And instead

the salary which I got was just a hundred francs more than I had as a student -- postgraduate
student without having any obligations. And not only this, but all these great problems,
financial problems, and -- and came the end of the month, I had sometimes to advance the money
for the secretary, and the postage, and so on, and so on. And this hasn't changed. It has only
grown in figures. They were smaller amounts, and now it's much higher amounts. And so I
came in. And -- but in reality, when -- while I was selected because of my legal knowledge, and
so on, I was involved in the whole movement immediately, and I took as much part in the
anti-German fight as in anything else. And I must say, I said I didn't regret the fifty-five years.
But there is, of course, tne factor, also, which I should mention. Nahum Goldman was a fantastic
chief, generous and -- as I said, he saw the essential. He did leave you enormous freedom. He
discussed with you the line, but not every comma and point. He would discuss with you the
general ideas. He would agree with you. He would make here and there a comment, "Perhaps
this is too strong," "Perhaps this is too weak." And he would leave it to you. And he would
leave you an enormous amount of freedom in the execution of your function and give you the
feeling of participation. He never considered me as an employee. There was always the feeling
of equality. He gave in the -- and I was what? -- about twenty-five years secretary general, first
coordinator, and secretary general of the Congress. I gave the staff, the higher staff a position of
codecision in the Congress. And because they knew, because they were underpaid, because they
had something to contribute, and they shouldn't take the layman's opinion. They should
contribute to it, and there should be codecision. And Nahum Goldman understood this very well.
And this, of course, facilitated enormously my work. I really felt that I have contributed. Many
things which have gone under the name of Goldman came in fact from me. I never resented that.
We were working on a joint project, a joint work. And, therefore, this fact. I am not saying that

[hadn't a complaint. A complaint was, on the one hand, we were all very badly paid. We are
really idealistic workers, but we didn't -- I often said -- once Israel Sieff, the great philanthropist,
the Zionist in England, said to me, "You could become any moment administrator director of one
of my 122 stores in England." I said to him, "This is very nice, the nicest thing." These stores,
each of them, had more than a million pounds -- how do you say? --Umsatz -- turnover, yeah. So
there -- at the time, I think 132 million pounds, which was not bad. And I said, "Israel, it's very
nice what you said to me. It's perhaps the nicest thing. But if I wanted to make money, I would
have become a banker, not a secretary of the World Jewish Congress." And this is it. This was
real idealism. And I include practically all my colleagues in this. We all worked for the cause,
not for the money. And we were deeply involved in the cause. We lived it and we developed it.
It didn't exist as a scheme. And this was, of course, very attractive, and, therefore, I stayed.
Q. Things must have changed rather radically for you when the war broke out. I mean, here
you were -- you were hired partly because of your legal expertise, your international legal
problems.
A. Yeah.
Q. Now there was no legality. There was no effective League of Nations.
A. On the contrary. You had to learn during the war that everything which is legal is no good,
and everything which is not legal has to be done. And the complete confusion of what is --

Q. How did you decide to do what you ended up doing, which was simply -- well, which was,
among other things, to amass as much information as possible about what was going on?
A. Now, this was -- became -- this developed very naturally. The first days in the war we
decided we had -- we have to deal -- there was an emergency, and the great -- the great danger is
for the whole Jewish world. One of the terrible things [for] which I will never forgive myself --
was the last days before the war broke out, there was a Zionist Congress in Geneva. And
everybody wanted to go home. And I helped hundreds of people to get transit visas to get home.
Because I was the only one who had the relations with several of the consulates. And the French
consulate -- one day worked the whole shabbat to get 150 passports or what -- stamped through.
And afterwards, I said, "What have you done?" But, of course, nobody could foresee. No.
But on the third day of the war, we, for instance, communicated to the International Committee
of the Red Cross, that we had organized ourselves in a special little committee in which we are
dealing with the world -- with the war affairs, and that we wanted to be in contact with them, and
we were certainly the first to take this -- this initiative. We established -- and this was -- at that
time not yet so important, but later it became more important. This committee, which was called
a Relief Committee for the War-Stricken Jewish Population -- and it was abbreviated RELICO,
which could be a Relief Congress or Relief Committee, whatever you wanted. It helped us to
establish relations with the occupied territories. We couldn't work under the name of the
Congress. The Congress was clearly an anti-German, anti-Nazi movement, and in order not to
endanger the people, we used from -- from that September on, this second name. For several
years I used practically only this name. The other side was diplomatic -- oh, yes -- to America
and England. And when the war got to its end, I took out the "World Jewish Congress" again

and started writing on this paper. And this was, of course, very helpful. I mean, this was very
important. And the situation -- I have recently -- I have it somewhere here, but in my --
Q. Luggage?
A. In my luggage. Statistics. How we became active in all kinds of services which nobody
could render but we in Geneva, in a neutral country. We became a little Red Cross, a little
Jewish Red Cross. We transmitted messages from one to the other -- thousands, not a few. In
the thousands. In the tens of thousands. We made inquiries where people are. And we -- we
transmitted money, so -- to relatives, to friends, and so on. There were hundreds of such
initiatives. I have a statistic in -- for certain months, which is interesting. We had an enormous
amount of purely humanitarian activities which developed by themselves. And you couldn't
stop. You couldn't say "I won't do it." That wasn't possible, humanely not possible. And I have
in my files letters where I plead with New York, "You cannot stop this here. There is so much
human hope and need involved." And Nahum Goldman left Geneva in -- in May 1940, before
the downfall of France. He smelled it. He knew what he was doing. He said, of course, he
would come back, and he never came back. But he also knew that -- he was right, that he
couldn't have done in Geneva political actions. He was right to decide to go to America. And
then there was a moment where New York wanted to close the Geneva office. And there is a
very violent correspondence between New York and me. And I just refused to close. I was
right. They had great financial difficulties. Without Goldman, they thought, well, what -- what
-- this is how our polling (??) -- and this -- Geneva. And I pleaded. And the statistic which I
have taken from some of these correspondence -- I just refused. As a matter of fact, in the

terrible -- vielleicht [perhaps]-- one of the greatest things which I have done, one of the best
things which I did -- in the terrible situation of the summer of 1940 -- and you cannot imagine
what that meant, the downfall of France, for all of us. This was really the -- practically the end.
And in Geneva, in Switzerland, it -- Fascist Italy, Austria, the Nazi Germany, all Nazi, now
France, Nazi. Where was hope?
Q. And you were surrounded?
A. We were completely surrounded. You couldn't get out normal -- there was -- then the
so-called non-occupied part of France, a little piece where you could get out, but -- this was
really the most difficult. And there was complete chaos and mental despair. And the people
didn't know what to do. They went to Zurich. People came to Geneva. Geneva people came to
Zurich. In the offices was terrible confusion. What do you do? What can we do? And I
decided with one of my colleagues, Fritz Uhlmann, who was in the agency, we leave the Geneva
offices and go on vacation in the mountains and not be infected by this terrible depression. We
have to keep our minds open. We have decided to remain. We have to stay where we are. This
is more important than anything else. There have to be some offices who will remain and will be
responsible for whatever still can be done.
Q. When you thought of keeping that office open, was your consideration primarily in terms of
helping the people who needed help, or finding a place where —

A. Whatever. We saw that the information was essential for that. And we saw that we could
do still very many things for the people inside.
Q. So it was both?
A. Both. Both. Both. And we just wanted to keep our heads free from the confusion and
deterioration of the atmosphere. The atmosphere was terrible. People wanted to run away, and
soon. I must say, Wise sent me in August, '40, a visa to America, one of the first emergency
visas, which shows my personal relationship with Wise. He sent it also to Gugenheim, who
didn't take it, and to one or two other people. But I -- I had still a German passport at the time.
And I put it in the passport and left it in the passport. I didn't have any intention. On the
contrary. When Nahum Goldman left, we foresaw all kinds of it. He bought me a Bolivian
passport, which was from the real consul of Bolivia. I never -- this was for an emergency. The
situation was so frightening and so unclear, I had at my home in -- a packed Rucksack, with
shoes, and so on, to go into the mountains, if necessary, to disappear, that the World Jewish
Congress office would be -- in case of invasion or what -- the first to be looked after was clear to
me. I mean, the fact that this Rucksack was packed and the -- some of the things which you
need when you are on your own shows you the atmosphere in which you were. Desperate. And
we were really desperate. And I will tell you another story. We were in Switzerland. It was the
center of espionage. Don't forget this, either. One of my best friends was a French vice-consul.
When I came -- I had spent summer vacation in -- partly in Holland and partly with him in
Britanny, where his family had very close friends really. He was married to a Jewish girl,
Russian Jewish girl, and we were very close. Not only -- the whole group of young people. And

I remember the second day, his wife was still at the -- on the vacation, hadn't come back. And
we ate in the evening together. He had a little car. I didn't. And he came to fetch me. I think
must have been the 2nd or 3rd of September of '39. And he said, "Let's go to this and this
restaurant, but I have to do two other things before." And he said, "And you can look at it."
And he stops before a house, takes out the mail from one of the boites postales, the boxes, and
puts it in his pocket and takes out of his pocket another from the day before. And so he did that
two or three places. These were German officials, I think, journalists and officials at the
international labor office, who were controlled by the French secret services. And he showed it
to me, that I should know in what situation we were. And I never forgot this. I mean, I laughed.
I smiled when I saw what the situation was. It was not gemuetlich, I tell you. And became
always less gemuetlich. Now, so we moved in this field slowly from one to the -- then, of
course, when terrible things happened, we organized ourselves to be involved and to be able to
report. There were no direct communications of any kind. So we kept the relations, the
correspondence with the Jewish community as long as we could. We subscribed to all the
Jewish newspapers. I subscribed to all the official gazettes. I had I think twenty-three official
gazettes, which regularly -- you can see them I think now in Yad Vashem. I gave it to Yad
Vashem, or the institute gave it to Yad Vashem. I did this for the Institute of Jewish Affairs,
which since '40 was here in New York. And we translated those into one of the languages
that the Jews would understand, German, or French, English. I established a whole mechanism
how to get information. And I was helped by, for instance, the League of Nations library. There
was a man whom I knew very well, and so on, and he helped us. He knew what we were doing
and was a friend. So I could take photocopies of some of these official gazettes, and we
examined them each time and we found these -- all these anti-Jewish legislations and decrees.

And I made the files -- I don't know whether you have ever seen them -- at least of -- for
Romania and for France and for Germany and for General Gouvernement, for Boehmen und
Maehren, for Slovakia, and for Italy, and for the -- some of the especially established territories
like Alsace-Lorraine or the Baltics where there was also amilitary government, and so on. With
the help of some of the League of Nations officials then with the help of the book shop, they -- I
subscribed, and I was "Monsieur Mondial," who got these -- all kinds of -- we really organized
ourselves in order to be able to. And you know, you can obtain a lot of information on this.
Especially -- there were -- under Slovakian file, I think there were at least 150 official decrees
and communications which I had sent to New York and to London. They got it all. So we
organized ourselves in order to be able to inform. This was certainly the most important thing. I
felt -- we felt -- and I include Gugenheim, for instance. We felt that we were encircled, and
political decisions would have to be made outside. Our judgment was not sufficiently
independent. This, we accepted from that. That doesn't mean we shouldn't make proposals. We
made a lot of proposals. And our judgment was often better than that of the people who were
outside. I am not contesting that. But we never felt in these three years or four from -- am
speaking the years from '40 on -- that the decisions had to be made in New York and London.
And, therefore, my most important function was to report. This was developed very, very -- it
came from a political understanding of the situation.
Q. You can't make decisions unless you have good information?
A. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Now, I said, of course, we had reports from communities, and then we
had reports from individuals. Some people appeared, disappeared. You know, some wonderful

figures. There was a -- a Dutchman, he was shot later -- Nijkeirk, wonderful man. He was a
young Dutch who lived in Belgium and organized the Jewish youth and tried to -- you may have
heard the name. Maybe it's not on there. He was later arrested and put before a tribunal and
shot.
Q. Let me stop you there, because the tape is going to run out. I'm going to want to ask you on
the next tape when you started to collect information from people as well as from published
sources, and when --
A. This I couldn't tell you. This came -- you just -- you couldn't get enough.
Q. Yeah.
A. On the contrary.
Q. We can talk about some of the people then, but that will have to be on the next tape.
A. Yeah.
Q. Maybe they will give us some lunch now.

Q. Ifyou don't remember exactly when you started to get it, that's fine, but let's talk about the
people who -- from whom you got information.
A. Yeah. No. I spoke about this -- this Dutch Jew in Belgium.
Q. Yes.
A. Which -- this is the type of persons -- I mean -- there came, of course, others, but he was one
of the finest I -- Iremember. And he came by himself.
Q. Yes.
A. Of course, he knew that we -- there was the center, and we did things. And he came to
Lichtheim, and he came to me, and -- there were all kinds of these -- there was a -- I had
mentioned already Uhlmann, I think, with whom I went on vacation to save --
Q. Yes.
A. -- to save the -- the office, and I saved them -- you know, the offices. And we came back. It
was quiet and functioned. And nobody wanted to run away anymore. Now, it was a terrible
morale breakdown, of course. And one couldn't blame them. This was really a world which was

falling to pieces. But you had to have the strength of character that -- okay, this is a volcanic
eruption. We have to wait until it's over.
Q. There was, after all, a real chance that Switzerland could have been invaded. They had
considered it?
A. Sure. I told you, I had the packed Rucksack.
Q. Yes.
A. And [had the Bolivian passport, which I probably never could use, but anyhow -- whatever.
Q. Do you want to tell us when -- (Discussion with someone off-camera.) I'm sorry. I didn't
realize.

Q. We're on. Dr. Riegner, tell us more about some of the people who came in to you with
information that you proceeded then to send out in your reports.

one, the Dutchman -- a Danishman. You may know his name because there was recently -- a
book was published about him which is —
Q. Rottenberg?
A. Yeah, Rottenberg. Rottenberg -- you know, in -- extraordinary times produce extraordinary
people. This I have seen time and again. Rottenberg was a Danish Jew, who suddenly appeared
in our offices -- both Lichtheim and mine. We had on the same floor, the offices. You should
know the same -- in the same building and the same floor. We didn't know how he came, why
he came. We didn't know where he went. We found out that he had -- first of all, you are very
suspicious -- a Jew, a Danish Jew who can travel in Europe. You know that you can trust him?
He is aspy? Who knows? We find out -- we found out that he was somehow protected by the
military establishment, defense. I was very suspicious at the beginning. But the man came with
highly interesting information. I definitely remember that he gave us the first information on the
administration of the Reichsbahn, of the German railways, sending the bills for the deportation of
the Jews from Berlin to Riga and Lodz to the Jewish community in Berlin. They asked that the
Jewish community should pay for the transportation of the deportation. For me this was the
height of chutzpa which the Germans had. I was absolutely flabbergasted. And I reported this,
of course. The story is -- you can read it now in the book by a Danish Jew who heard me mention
Rottenberg in one of my lectures at the Nahum Goldman fellowship. And I asked him
afterwards, "Do you know Mr. Rottenberg?" And he, of course, never heard of him. And when
he went back to Denmark, he inquired. The story which he has now written in the book -- it's
very interesting -- that this Rottenberg was a German Jew who established himself -- I think in

1907, in Denmark, became a very successful businessman, had earned a lot of money, had a big
villa and a good business, and at the end of the First World War was approached by the German
embassy, if he, with the big villa he had, couldn't house provisionally some German officer who
was in trouble. And they agreed to it, and the officer came to live with him, and they became
very friendly. And he stayed months, several months with him. And finally, he left, and
Rottenberg loaned him still some money. And then he wrote him a letter and the officer wrote
him a letter of thanks, and said if ever he could do anything for him, he would do. Signed,
"Goering." Now, in 1933, Rottenberg remembered this and wrote a letter to Goering, who in the
meantime became Marshal -- Feld Marshall Goering, the second personality of the Reich. And
Rottenberg had some family in southern Germany still, and he asked whether he could help him
to -- to bring them out. And Goering invited him immediately to come to Berlin and gave him
all the permits necessary, and the permit he left -- his passports without J stamp, and so on. And
Rottenburg must have then felt that he had some influence and tried to do certain other things for
the Jewish community in Berlin. I haven't been able to read all the book because it's in Danish,
so I don't know the details, but I know that he was in contact with a number of Jewish
personalities like Sally Meier, like Winfried Israel and Schwarz and -- all this I didn't know. But
I knew -- and we -- we established -- the author of this book approached me in Geneva, "Have
you -- what is written in your files about him?" I told him immediately, "You will not find
anything. You will not find the name. This is the type which I wouldn't put down in writing.
But you may find some of his stories." And I told him the story, for instance, about this -- the
bills from the Reichsbahn to the Jewish community. He said, "But you have to tell me, what are
the dates he visited Switzerland?" This I don't remember. So he produced the passports, the
passports of Rottenberg. And we found the exact dates, and we looked in my files, and what

after such dates I wrote in reports to America or London. And the story about the Reichsbahn,
about the railway administration is there. Exactly after -- there is no name of "Rottenberg;"
"From a very reliable source, I hear this and this and this." And we found him several such
stories. You see, such things happened, and whether he was able to find any to say -- to help
some people to get out, I don't know. I cannot read the other chapters of the book. But I take
another incident. One of the best organized communities and quite courageous was the Czech
community. And we were in very good relations with them. And the -- my colleague, Fritz
Uhlmann, who was in Lichtheim's office. He was working for the Keren Hayesod and for -- was
in fact also a kind of "personne de confiance" for the Czech Jews and looking after their
interests. And he knew all the persons, and I knew through him most of them. And Prague sent
from time to time -- didn't send -- used employees of the Swiss consulate in Prague to commit
messages. And the girl came to Uhlmann and had learned by heart a certain number of things
which she repeated. Some extremely important things: about Theresienstadt, about some of the
camps, about movement, about Slovakia. And this -- this type of initiative coming from the
communities existed, too. And so you have a whole series of types of initiatives. Later we were
in contact with some of the liberation movement. We were in contact, for instance, in France
with the underground Jews. At a certain moment, one of the French Jewish leaders, Mark
Yarblum, who was a member of the Congress executive, came to Geneva, from France. There
came a number of messages which were sent to him or to me from his groups. My secretary,
Vermilla Becker, who I had for nearly forty years as secretary, the daughter of an old Zionist,
Julius Becker, was sometimes in the morning at six o'clock woken up by some French railway
locomotive driver who brought her a message, a whole package of stories, reports, about what
was happening. These were the other initiatives. Our names didn't figure. Vermilla Becker

wasn't known, of course, as a person -- so they came to her home in the morning at six o'clock
and brought her a message, and such things -- a number. There were people who were active.
Don't forget. We had, of course, in Switzerland, a number of Jewish refugees from various
countries. And they -- we used them. And we had people from various nationalities who kept
the relationship with their community or school friends indirect to the important people in their
community. Well, say, Yugoslavia. I had one from Zagreb, and I had one from Belgrade. And I
asked them, "Get me the information." I used them, and they produced it. We had people from ,
this is already later, Italy, Raffaello Cantoni_came -- who was the first president of the Italian
Jewish communities after the war. He came in 1943, when Mussolini went down, and there was
the whole group of seven thousand Italian Jews who came to Switzerland. I met him. There
was the head of the refugee organization for the Jews in Italy, in Genoa, for the whole of Valobra
(Ph). He came regularly to bring us reports. And not only on the Italian things. He had also
reports from other countries. There was a whole network of people who brought reports or sent
reports or caused that other people sent us reports. It's not -- it is -- not that you can plan this
systematically, but you can produce the result in -- inviting people, and in this way we benefited
very, very much. But, you see, the sources are very, very different. And you used everything.
And you, of course, had to judge if what they say is worth nothing. I give you another source of
information. We have to speak about the Red Cross. Here I will take one person, who worked in
the Commission Mixe, the Mixed Commission for Relief, which was a joint enterprise of the
International Committee of the Red Cross and of the League of Red Cross Society. There I had a
good friend, a Baltic baron, from Riga, who -- with the knowledge of the others or not, I doubt --
I think it was his own initiative. Each time when the German Red Cross delegation was in
Geneva or when was in Germany and brought report -- he called me. This was not official. This

was -- and he gave me detailed information what they had -- what they had reported in their
private conversations, not only in official. And he gave me some advice as to what should be
done and how we should push the Red Cross for more, and so on. But he also reported on some
of -- of the atmosphere in Germany of the "Stimmung," of the way how people felt about the
destructions, and so on, and so on. And these were very important factors to evaluate the
situation. And you will find in my reports a number of such -- I am not saying from whom it
came. I couldn't, and I wouldn't. But I said I have very good sources, and this and this. So there
is -- I told you about the -- the written information, the letters came in. You know, in -- even in
internment camps, people tried to convey to you something. I don't know if we will come to it.
We have sent -- I don't know -- I believe 100,000 packages for -- to people in internment camps,
maybe more even. And they all got a postcard to confirm. And I had tens of thousands of such
confirmations. They are in Yad Vashem. You can find them. I remember there was a family
which I knew personally, and there were several sisters. And they got some packages. Some
were paid by family and some were -- we took a supplement, and out of the supplement, we
financed gratis packages. And the administration, of course, we had, also. So in the receipts, in
the postcards -- which, of course, was forbidden to write anything, but they wrote. And one of
the sisters informed me that the sister had died. This was important, so -- and this wasn't the
only type of information. They conveyed information which was terribly useful. So it -- this
was a chaotic time. And a chaotic time needs all kinds of inventions. You had not to do the
normal things. You had to do extraordinary things. My greatest accusation against the
establishment in the Jewish world is that they didn't live up sufficiently to this extraordinary
time, where we needed not the normal, but the abnormal. I give you an example. The famous
report on Auschwitz of the two Slovakian Jews. It came -- the first copy came through the

Czechoslovakian ambassador to the League of Nations. The League of Nations had not
recognized the disappearance of Czechoslovakia. There was no ambassador of Czechoslovakia
anymore in Bern, but the one in Geneva existed. I used him very much, a wonderful man. And I
trusted the Czechs more than the Poles and more than the others. When I needed communication
with London which shouldn't be controlled, I used the Czechs. He got from the Czech -- Slovak
underground these reports. Not only -- there came another report which is always forgotten from
a Polish officer.
Q. Polish --
A. Yeah. Which also was a terrible report. Very, very reliable report from a Polish officer. I
don't know who it was. And from these two Slovakian Jews who escaped and who had done this
for the Bratislava people. By the way, I was asked later to get these two Slovakian Jews to
Nuremberg for the trial of the BUNA. And I found them. And I delivered them. And they were
-- this was done by me. They asked me, "Who were these people?" I didn't know myself who
they were, but I found out in Prague immediately and everybody knew what -- where to find
them. And yeah. And this report which came, as I said, to the Czechoslovakian ambassador, he
gave it to Uhlmann, who was -- and said to give this to Riegner and ask him to make a summary
for me. This was -- I don't know -- thirty, forty pages, I mean.
Q. A long report.
A. "Lhave to cable something, but I cannot cable forty pages. Ask him to make a summary."
And I made a summary of three, four pages, which I gave to him, and which I gave to the

Americans, and I gave to the British, and which, by the way, then made the round. I saw it. It
was communicated by the American ambassador to other people -- Winant -- and it's my report.
Because I see that it was. But that's not what lam saying. I get the report and sit down to work.
And it's a very interesting compilation, of course, of all of the whole situation of the camp, and
then reconstruction, transport by transport, according to the numbers of -- two million, more than
two million people. And I go through the list. And I find at a certain moment a group of people
from Prague, from Theresienstadt arriving in Auschwitz. And a group of young people, under
the leadership of a well-known Maccabee -- young leader, and -- arriving in Auschwitz for
quarantine for six months. Now, we never heard there was quarantine in Auschwitz for six
months. And a few lines after that, they were exterminated. And then a few lines again -- it's the
second such report -- transport coming also for quarantine for six months. And I look at my
calendar, and I see that the quarantine for the second group expires in five days. I stop my work.
I take a taxi. I go to the Czechoslovakian minister and show him this. And in the taxi, I wrote
out a telegram for the Czech government. They should day and night in the BBC speak about it,
that we know, and so on, that this and this group will be -- perhaps we can't -- it's a crazy idea.
It's not a normal idea. And Kubetzki (Ph), who is the name of the Minister ? -- has even a better
way. He goes to the BBC representative at the British embassy, a lady -- Wiskemann (ph). I
knew her, too. And he sends it to her, and said, "You should do this," and it was done. And they
transmitted the message several time from London in Czech and -- Now, I never heard for years
whether it had any effect. It was a crazy idea. It was in this respect, an attempt to save some
people. Until one day I meet a man who was in Auschwitz from the Czech group, Kulka, the
father of the historian. It was also written. And he told me, "Yes, I know." I said, "How do you
know?" He said, "We heard this on the radio." I said, "You had radio?" He said, "Of course,

we had radio. And we were hiding these people." He said -- at that moment these people were
not killed. Whether they were killed later, I can't tell you. Because they were distributed in
other places. But now I am not taking any credit for this. It was a crazy idea, but this is the type
of crazy ideas you had to have to work.
Q. Yeah. You had to try things that were unconventional because the situation was
unprecedented?
A. Absolutely. Now, take another thing. I have mentioned this a number of times, but it's very
typical. Yitzhak Greenberg, who was a head of the Hazalah in the Jewish agency in Jerusalem.
Now, you don't know Yitzhak Greenberg, your generation. For you it doesn't mean anything.
Yitzhak Greenberg was one of the great fighters for Jewish rights in the Polish Sejm (parliament)
for the -- in the times of the terrible anti-Semitic events and persecutions in Poland. He was the
one most courageous who stood up in the Sejm and attacked the government. And we had all
enormous respect and admiration for the man who did this -- who had this. At that time he was
in Israel -- in Palestine. He was at the head of the Hazalah department. One day I get a telegram
from Yitzhak Greenberg, "Find my son." I don't know whether you have ever heard this story.
And I said to myself, Greenberg? He knows what's important. How can you find his son?
Crazy. And I think and think, and I couldn't sleep for two three nights. I said, What can I do to
find his son? Finally, I took a crazy idea. I sent fifteen or twenty packages to fifteen or twenty
camps, under the name of the son. And I found the son. It was crazy, and I sacrificed fourteen
packages. Who knows what they became. Generally they arrived, you know. We didn't know
this. But we took our list. And New York didn't want us to do this. New York said this was

against the blockade. And I said, "I'm sitting in Switzerland. I don't care. I help people." And
whoever gets -- and I have the testimony of one of the people in the Unterstuetzungsstelle in
Krakow who confirmed to me that practically all -- collective sendings, dispatches -- and
individual, well, you know how the Germans are. They are correct. They are correct in bad
things, and they are correct in good things. It was received. And it helped a lot of people. I
know -- I sent, for instance, to my old teacher, Leo Baeck, the great Jewish leader with whom I
was bar mitzvahed. When I heard he was in Theresienstadt, I sent him packages. He didn't
know from whom it came. I spoke to him later, years after, in London, and I told him it came
from me. He said, "Well, anyhow, we distributed it to some of our friends." But you had to --
this was the situation. It was absolutely irrational. And you had to do irrational things. And this
is what most of the people didn't do. Now, let's come to the -- to the -- I want to -- to come to
some of the major problems in the Holocaust, in the -- how I learned that -- what was done, what
was not done, and why the people didn't -- didn't do. These are the major things which I haven't
spoken at all yet.
Q. Allright. Why don't we lead into that with the receipt of the phone call from Segalovitz
and...
A. Okay.
Q. It is fair to say that this was the -- of all of the pieces of information that you received during
the war, this was the one that made the greatest impact on you?

A. No. This was, of course -- this was -- I think we should start -- how we got the information,
what we knew.
Q. Please.
A. When you raised the question of my famous telegram, I have to say, in introduction, that the
world didn't begin with this telegram. I think I have given you already the impression that all
what we did developed in the -- in an evolution corresponding to the political situation in which
it developed. And each situation incited us to make another step. You don't plan all the -- you
plan the first step. And then the number of steps follow. And that I said that we have reported
on the situation. And it is fair to say that -- when you see the whole reporting, it's astonishing
how well we were informed. Once a year, for instance, I sent -- together with Lichtheim -- a
telegram to New York, the last on the eve of the Atlantic City conference, which is a resume how
we see the situation in November 1944 with figures about the dead and the living and what we
believe is still there and what is -- it's an astonishing document. It's practically what we found
after the war. So -- but Emerson, the Director-general of the London International Refugee
Organization, to whom I gave this in November or December of '44, asked me a year later when
I was in London, he said -- he greeted me. "Yeah. You are the fellow with the figures." He
said, "How did you -- how did you know the figures? This is in fact what we have today." And I
say, "Listen, when you follow things in the way in which we followed, day by day, and week by
week, and month by month, and year by year, you have a feeling. You have facts, and you have
a feeling how things develop. And you come to certain estimates, and they -- usually they are
based on information." So this is a whole process of information. We know very well and we

reported on all the terrible things which happened in '40 and '41 and '42. Based -- the whole
ghettoization and the terrible situation in the ghettos, and so on, in Poland. This is all -- we had.
But then comes the Russian war, the invasion that -- to us. And here is the great dividing line.
From there dates really the total extermination policy. On the eve -- little earlier. I think
May,'41. Maybe the decision made -- had been taken even earlier, not -- it's not very important,
whether it's two, three months earlier or not. But anyhow, the decision when -- on
einsatzkommandos, it's there in May of '41. And you -- and we hear during the year '41,
practically three months after the invasion -- we hear all kinds of terrible things -- about killings
here and killings there and ten thousand there and five thousand there and twenty thousand there.
They are various names of cities, and so on. And in October, '41, which means three months
later, three months after the invasion, I write to Nahum Goldman one of the letters -- didn't write
too many letters, so this is one of the great letters I had written. I said, "The news from the
eastern front are terrible. They're so terrible that I do not know how many Jews would survive
this war if this continues." I don't know exactly what happens in Russia. We had no -- no
possibility to reach over there. There was no -- even diplomatic relations in Switzerland with
Russia, which is not known probably. But I do not know -- but west of Dnieper and the Bug, I
don't know of how many Jews would survive. October, '41. And then comes March, '42, six
weeks, about, after the so-called Wannsee Conference, of which we, of course, didn't know
anything. Which is also not the decisive moment but it is the moment in which the whole
extermination policy is now being carried out, supported by every administration of the Reich.
Six weeks after we decide -- Lichtheim and I -- to go to the Nuncio, to the Papal Nuncio, and to
appeal to the Vatican, at least do something in the countries in which the Catholic church had
influence, where there are priests at the head of the state, and so on. And there's a very important

diplomat of the Vatican, Philip Bernardini, through whom many, many of the communications
from the Vatican went to the western countries. And yet he received us very -- very fine. And
asked us to write -- "Give us a memorandum." We give him a memorandum, in which we
describe in the major Catholic countries or countries with large Catholic populations what the
situation is. And in this memorandum you will find several times the -- a phrase like, "The aim
can only be total liquidation." I don't think there were extermination figures, but total liquidation
of the Jewish community figures, which means that we were fully aware that this was happening.
And I add something more. Around the same time, in -- I would say partly end '41, beginning
'42, come the first reports on experiments on the human body, injections, and so on. And the
second is the gas vans. They experiment with gas vans in which vans -- in which people are
being gassed in an Autobus and killed in this way. Not yet of camps and gas -- publics. And the
first time you hear it, you are really skeptic. And the second time, too. When it comes from
different places and different versions and different people, you start taking it seriously. So lam
saying we are fully aware of the terrible things that are going on there. And then comes an end
of July. The German man reports to his business friends in Switzerland, "I hear of the plan of the
total extermination of the Jews of Europe." And the man, which -- now known, the man, head of
the -- Eduard Schulte, a man who was at the head of a very big mining concern, Giesche and
Company, who occupied thirty thousand workers for the war, who had access to the highest
authorities. There was even the -- what is it called -- Wir -- it's an order, special title of -- Wir —
Q. Wirtschaftsfuehrer?
A. Wirtschaftsfuehrer. We were told he had access to Hitler's headquarters. And comes to his
business friends, and says, "I heard in the -- Hitler's headquarters of a discussed plan of the

deportation to the east of the totality of Jews. Three and a half million to four million Jews
should be, will be killed in the east. And they still discussed the means, but I hear of prussic
acid." Now, while we are receiving this, this plan was in full execution. He comes back in six
weeks later -- not even -- few weeks later, and says, "I now know that there is an order, and it is
in full execution." This is always forgotten to be mentioned, but this is a fact. So he himself is
now sure and knows.
Q. Tell us a bit specifically how you got this information, the other people involved.
A. Now, they -- the people involved is a Jewish concern of Jack Rosenstein, who was in -- a big
businessman in Zurich who was during the war in New York. He was a friend of Nahum
Goldman. He supported the Congress, Rosenstein. He was one of the financial supporters. He
has a representative, Isidor Koppelmann, who is in Basel and in Zurich. And Schulte is in
relationship with this group for many years. And Schulte says to Koppelmann, "You have to
inform the Jews officially." And Koppelmann was a good Jew, knows one of the Jewish officials
in the Swiss Jewish community, a very fine human being, Benjamin Segalovitz, the type of -- the
best type of Russian Jews, in the -- of the old aristocratic Russian Jewish type -- who lives in
Switzerland for many, many years. In fact, the family resided in Switzerland since 1914, when
the war broke out. And they established themselves in Switzerland. And Ben Segalovitz is the
specialist in the Jewish community on anti-Semitism and fights and is the head of the press
service but it's much more than the press service. He is really the man who is in charge of the
fight against anti-Semitism with regard to the Swiss community. And very respected and very
courageous. Stands up to his own superiors and attacks them -- publicly and sometimes -- and

Koppelmann informed Segalovitz. And Segalovitz, without hesitating, telephones me. The story
that he asked himself, Whom and what? It's not true. We were in constant contact. We spoke
on telephone two, three times a week at least. What I was doing in the world scene, he was
doing in the Swiss. We were in very close personal relations and great personal respect for each
other. It was a little bit -- there is a certain veil on it that in the later years -- where he had a new
girlfriend who was jealous of everything else and tried to disturb this very friendly relationship
with which we had. And one of the reasons was in -- that Moos didn't mention his name in his
book, which I was very sorry. I mentioned his name everywhere and gave the story and the -- it's
not only that he deserves to be credited. He immediately brought this to my knowledge. But we
did everything together from that moment on. And he is one of the finest human beings which I
have been working with in my life. I really give the highest credit to him and to his integrity and
his competence and his dedication to all Zionists and -- okay. He telephones me. He doesn't say
what it is. He said, "We have to meet immediately. When can we meet?" Two days later in
Lausanne. It was the first of August, national holidays. We are both free. And he wanted to go
to a chess competition or something. And we meet in Lausanne, and in Ouchi. And we discuss
for five or six hours walking along the lake and going into a restaurant or in a cafe and getting up
again and walking. And he tells me a story. The first thing was, "Who is the man? Is he
reliable? Is this a provocation? Is this possible? Is this imaginable? Are we a victim of some
manipulation?" And we -- from this moment on we think together. I mean in the real -- the best
way of cooperation. And for hours we turn around the argument. And I must say, there is
another element which -- now, we -- he and I knew more or less the same things. I shared with
him what I knew. And he helped bring about -- and people like him brought people who
informed us. And I had in my mind something which had deeply impressed me. I blink

backwards. In Witzen (Ph), 1939, half a year before the war started, I had to visit another man
with whom I worked together for several years who was a representative of the Danzig Jews.
We were working against Nazis in Danzig. There was a question of principle, not only the five,
six thousand Jews, but also this was a city under the League of Nations supervision, that if the
highest moral authority in the world cannot stop this, we cannot take this without protest. And,
therefore, we fought for -- very, very symbolically, also. But also really for the Jews in Danzig
and Dresta (ph), too. And he was one of the two representatives. His name was -- I think Walter
Gerson, a lawyer, one of the two leaders of the community with whom we had to do -- to deal.
The other was also a lawyer, Rosenzweig, I think. Was it Rosenberg or Rosenzweig? We have
to find out -- Bernard (ph). And he visited me in Witzen. We made a long promenade on the
first holiday through the campagne (i.e. open spaces surrounding the city) in -- in Geneva
campagne. And, of course, the situation was terribly tense. And we knew, all of us, that only a
war can put an end to this. And we knew, all of us, that the war was a terrible thing. And
everybody was split in his own feelings. What should one wish for? Without the war, Hitler
would never end. With the war, terrible things could happen. And then, while we had this
feeling, all of us, he starts telling me, "You know, when the war will come, what will be our
destiny?" And he paints with an absolutely fantastic imagination the situation of the Jewish
people if Hitler starts a war, where millions of the Jews will -- will be killed and disappear.
Now, spelling out something which we all felt somehow but we never dared say it aloud. It
shook me. I never forgot it. It was a kind of prophecy which, as I said, we felt it, but we didn't
dare say it. And when people say the Jews wanted the war, it's all nonsense. The Jews were
terribly divided in themselves. What can we help? What can we hope? While we go there along
the lake, this comes back to my mind.

Q. I think so. I think we'll probably have lunch now.
A. But this is a terrible story. It's unbelievable. You have to tell me -- you have to remind me,
that I say Walter Gerson. He was killed in the first ---?
TAPE #4
Q. What happened, Dr. Riegner, to this man who gave you a prophecy about the fate of
European Jewry?
A. When I remembered this prophecy, I had to remember his very sad end. And the Germans
marched into Poland in the fall 1939. There was shortly after a pogrom in Bromberg and in
Poznan -- must have been in October or so -- where five thousand Jews were killed. And Walter
Gerson, who had fled from Danzig to the Polish territories, was one of the first victims of this
pogrom. I had not forgotten this. Now, let me tell you why I believed -- and I can I believe say
also Segalovitz believed the truth of the story. There were three major reasons. The first was
that Hitler had himself announced a number of times, usually on the anniversary of the day that
he took power, the 30th of January, where there were usually a great manifestation. And already
on the 30th of January 39, before the war broke out, he threatened the Jews, whom he accused to
want to push for the war, and he threatened them that if -- one thing is certain, he said. This war,
if it breaks out, will not end with the defeat of the German people. It will end with the
extermination of the Jewish people in Europe. He repeated this threat a number of times,
usually, as I said, on the 30th of January. And I remembered this. I was following this in '36

already in my office. And I was usually commenting on such speeches to a number of journalists
in Geneva who followed together with me these speeches. And I said to myself, we haven't
taken Mein Kampf seriously. He announced all what he was going to do. And nobody had taken
it seriously. Here again is a threat. Nobody is taking it seriously. But now we cannot ignore it.
This was the first reason. The second reason was -- we are on the last of July, the first of August
-- and as I told you before, we knew, of course, many things which happened before. We knew
of the deportations from Berlin, from Vienna, from Prague, from other places. But something
was new. On the 14th, 15th of July, 1942, suddenly -- and nobody understood why -- tens of
thousands of Jews were arrested, in all great cities of western Europe. In Amsterdam, in
Brussels, in Antwerp, in Paris, in Lyon, in Marseilles, and so on. Suddenly, tens of thousands of
people were arrested. And in the week before already the first trains of deportations left to the
east. As I said, nobody understood why suddenly this happens. The report of Schulte gave the
explanation. Behind all this there was a plan. Behind all what we knew about the starvation, the
terrible living conditions, the ghettoization, the deportations, the mass murders -- behind all this
was one decisive fact, a decision by the Nazis to exterminate the totality of the Jews of Europe.
And the third reason why I believed it has very much to do with my own origin from Germany. I
knew the Nazis. I knew their brutality. I knew their fanaticism. I knew that, contrary to all
other enemies in history which we have encountered, we have here a group which is absolutely
fanaticized, which is absolutely determined to live up to its aims and for whom the Jew was a
personification of the devil, the personification of everything evil in the world, and that it was
one -- not one, but the central aim of the Nazi party program. It is characteristic that in his first
political letter to a comrade written in September 1919, long before he published Mein Kampf --
it's the first document of political character which we know of Hitler until his famous political

last will, the day when he committed suicide, on the 29th of April, 1945. In his first political
until his last political document, the fight against world Jewry is considered by him his major
aim. And he preaches this in 1919 as in 1945. I knew about their brutality. I have already
spoken about my experiences as a student in the student elections. But I have seen it, also, in my
experience, the day when they arrived to power, the demonstrations on the 30th of January, on
the 1st of April, the boycotting. I knew about who had burned the Reichstag. When I left in
May 19 —
Q. '33?
A. --'33, [knew about the first concentration camps, in Oranienburg, and in -- other place
which escapes me at the moment. I knew about the torture of his political enemies which took
place in the building of the former Communist newspaper, the Rote Fahne. And everybody who
was a little bit interested in the political affairs knew it. I knew about the violence with which
they fought their political enemies. There was a famous story about the murder in a Polish --
German Polish frontier city, which -- in which they ruthlessly turned the facts upside down, and
we knew that the German Nazis were full of fanaticism and did not know any ethical or moral
limits to their exercise of power, that for them, good is what benefits Germany, as the Nazis
understood it, was the essence of their doctrine. And in this, the Jewish question was the central
point. Now, I did not limit myself to convincing myself that all these reasons made the report of
Schulte very probable and very nearly convinced myself that it is an accurate report. I told so,
also, the American vice-consul, whom I met. My idea after having met together with Segalovitz
-- Koppelmann, who confirmed what Segalovitz had reported to me, who told us a little bit more

about his relations with Schulte, his reports which he had brought before with regard to the
development of the war. Amongst other things, he had rightly informed them of the date of the
invasion of Russia. And a number of other similar reports turned out to be completely correct,
which gave us the conviction that we had to do with a very serious source. And this --
Q. At this point you still didn't know his name?
A. At this point I didn't still know his name. I didn't want to see him, and he didn't want to see
us. Don't forget: We are, after all, at war with Germany, and the whole situation was terribly
tense, and -- but the reports about his reliability and his antecedence gave us a good measure of
conviction that we had to deal with a very serious source. I decided to keep the whole story to
myself, and only to consult Professor Gugenheim, who was our legal advisor. And when Nahum
Goldman left Geneva in 1940, he asked me in very serious problems to consult Gugenheim as a
major person with whom I should be in contact. I had written the same evening a long letter to
Gugenheim. I told him what I found out and told him what I had intention to do and wanted his
consent. And he spoke to me the next day on the telephone. He agreed to the plan. As a very
careful, prudent, good, Swiss citizen, he moderated some of my phrases and introduced some
cautious words.
Q. These were the phrases that were in the telegram you proposed to send out to the Americans
and the British?
A. Yes. I made a draft of a telegram which I wanted to give the Americans and the British, and
he moderated this a little bit, but the basic -- some people later have accused me, "But you didn't

believe yourself. You have put in some cautious words." But if you would see what I sent to
the American vice-consul -- the consul was not in Geneva. He was on vacation -- and to the
British vice-consul, you would see, and -- Mr. Elting, who was the American vice-consul, has
written about this, given some information of it -- you will see that I was very strong in my
convictions. And I told them, in spite of these words, that I was convinced that the things were
serious, and I gave him all the reasons why I believed in it. Elting must have consulted his
chief, Mr. Squire, a consul, whom I knew. Elting I had never met. And they agreed, and he sent
the text to Bern legation, and that they should forward everything to Washington. I said, in fact,
three things to Elting: "Inform your government, check the contents, what I tell you. You have
the Secret Service. I don't. And three, give this telegram to Wise, the president of the World
Jewish Congress, in Washington." And I said the same to the vice-consul of the British, and
asked him to give the -- send the telegram to Mr. Sydney Silverman, who was the chairman of
the British section of the World Jewish Congress and a very prominent member of the British
Parliament. In fact, the two telegrams were identical, with one exception, and it's very typical,
the exception. The telegram to Silverman said at the end, "Inform and consult New York."
Now, as I had sent the other telegram to Wise, it doesn't make much sense, but it shows that I
was not convinced that the Americans would deliver the telegram to Wise, and that I was
convinced that the British, because of their parliamentary traditions, would not dare not deliver
the message to a prominent member of Parliament, and my guess was true. It happened exactly
like this. The Americans did not deliver the message to Wise and informed me so by letter from
Mr. Squire, the American consul, on the date of the 24th of August, in which he writes that
(reading) "I am informed that the legation at Bern transmitted the substance of this telegram to
the Department of State for delivery to Dr. Wise in its discretion, but it is now in receipt of

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189 58
telegraphic instructions from the department which indicate that it is disinclined to deliver the
message in question in view of the apparently unsubstantiated character of the information which
forms its main theme." Now, I don't know what I could have substantiated more. I know we
know from some of the historians who have studied the files in the State Department that some
people were afraid of Wise, and if the rabbi finds out, he will make a big scandal. But this is
only the first instance of a very unfriendly attitude of the Department of State in this whole
matter. With regard to the British, they delivered the message to Sydney Silverman, although it
took ten days, and I never found out why. Apparently they looked for him in London, but the
parliamentary session was finished, and so he was at home in Liverpool and -- but it's not clear
why they couldn't find him earlier. Finally, they found him, but he didn't believe in the thing,
either. And you study today the files which have been published -- after all, this is now public --
to a great extent, at least -- public property, you will see the marks in the file of the State
Department: "These are wild rumors borne out of Jewish fears." For the first ten or fourteen
days, or even more, nobody cared for the substance, what I had informed. They only asked,
"Who is Riegner?" And my name was at that time completely unknown, for several reasons.
One of the reasons, that my family was until the end of 1938 still in Germany, and I had asked all
colleagues in the Congress to keep my name out of circulation and out from documents. So
nobody had seen my name. And when they asked in London at the Jewish agency and some
other places, they didn't know me, either, because I had nothing to do with them. So this was
only -- slowly when other reports came in in the same direction, with the same content, they
finally started to give some —
Q. Credence, believability?

A. Yeah -- believability to these reports. And I am -- some of the historians have shown that
my telegram finally has completely changed the attitude of the British government in the case --
on the whole subject of war crimes and war criminals. Now, when the telegram was received by
Silverman, he tried to telephone to Wise in America and was prevented by the War Department
to do so. Finally, the War Department sent a coded telegram to Wise in New York, from
Silverman -- and it is only when this arrived in New York, was fully informed. Now, the
question about how did the Jews react to -- let's say the Congress people? This is something
which I am, of course, interested very much, and I have three or four witnesses on which I can
report. I asked my colleague in New York, Morris Bernzweig, who was the head of the
International Affairs Department in New York -- who was British, but during the war he went to
New York -- and asked him, "How did you react to this? You were present when the telegram
arrived. Did you believe it, or did you have doubts? What?" He said clearly to me, "Nobody
put this report into question. We took it. We accepted it." As a matter of fact, Stephen Wise,
when he got it, wrote two letters, deeply -- which he is deeply worried, deeply moved, deeply in
despair, one to Justice Frankfurter, and he writes in a few lines that he received this message, and
that he is in despair. What could one do? And he asked Frankfurter to inform the boss, which
means Roosevelt, which Frankfurter has certainly done. They were in very close relations. And
he underlines -- and this is very funny for me -- that the report come from one whom he names
"very conservative." Now, I have never been described by anybody as a very conservative
person, but what Wise obviously meant, that I am very careful in my judgment, that I am not a
"Schreier", and that I am known for my reliability and for my good judgment. It's interesting to
see such -- such words to appear when you feel you are really not a very conservative person.
But -- in this sense of reliability and not exaggerating, and so on, it is very accurate. The other

letter is even a much greater expression of despair, to his very close friend, the Pastor John --
James -- Holmes -- Hanes. What's the name? The pastor and the minister, the name -- you have
to correct that -- the -- it's one of the closest friends -- a Protestant pastor with whom Wise was
very close, and they exchanged the pulpit even, and so on. And there is in the letters which Foss
has edited, an outburst of his despair, "What can we do?" And sees that he is absolutely shaken
at his foundations about this report, and sees the catastrophe and takes it for serious, too. I
mean, there is no doubt. He has known me in '36 at the Congress. He has known me on one or
two other occasions when we met and had obviously great respect for my integrity and my
reliability. And Wise goes to Sumner Welles and -- not knowing, of course, that the telegram is
laying in the State Department -- and Sumner Welles forbids the publication. There are people
who criticized Wise that he accepted this. I don't know whether he was right or he was wrong.
But he agreed that they will make other inquiries about the reliability of the content, the veracity
of the content of the cable, and has decided to ask the Vatican and the International Red Cross
for their opinion. Now, the Vatican -- this I have described in one of my speeches in Cincinnati
has a very strange attitude. Titmann, who was the deputy to the official representative of the
president to the Vatican, insists a number of times to get information of the attitude of the
Vatican on this information. And finally, he gets a wishy-washy reply: "We know, also, that
there are very bad reports coming in about the treatment of the Jews, but we have no onfirmation
about the story of the extermination." And more or less this is the reply. Very strange. Because
the -- I believe the Vatican was at least as well informed as we were. They had hundreds of
priests who came -- traveled through Europe and came to Rome and informed the Vatican
authorities. A man, historian, former priest himself, Franconi, Carlo Franconi -- writes about the
hundreds of reports who came and -- from all over and how much they -- how well they were

informed. And in the documents which the Vatican has published themself, there are a number
of very important facts, where you see that a number of Nuncios had very clearly reported about
what is happening to the Jews. There was a special man who was active, I believe, for the Order
of Malta, who was pursuing in Poland some welfare activities, humanitarian activities, who
writes a number of times reports already in May, and another in October, '42, where he -- one of
the reports he says something like "There are two new things. On the one hand, the
bombardment of the cities, and the other is the intensification of the extermination of the Jews.
More than two million have already been killed." I mean, this information was there. Why the
Vatican ignores it and doesn't tell it, 1 don't know. And the Red Cross didn't give any -- any
concrete answer, either, International Red Cross. Now, we will come back to the attitude of the
Red Cross at a later point, where I will say what I have to say about the Red Cross. Now, I see
that one doesn't believe -- but doesn't believe, and there is now on -- two activities on parallel.
The one activity is my own. I try by all of the possible means to find corroborating evidence
from other sources. And the other is the activity especially of our British section, which was
very active, was a wonderful group, of Lady Reading, of Silverman, of Baru(ph), of Alex
Easterman, of -- a marvelous leadership group which was acting in a very fine, coordinated way.
And they approach all the governments in exile, the British governments, and try to work on
them. And an interesting story there is that one of their best friends was President Benes of
Czechoslovakia, considered it a German provocation and didn't believe in it. And on the other
hand, the only one who believed it, accepted it as fact, was Ivan Maisky, the Russian mbassador,
who probably had known by his own experience that the extermination of peoples is possible,
even by so-called civilized countries. At the same time, they tried to obtain some kind of a
statement of the Pope, through a concerted action of the countries represented in London -- and

taking up an idea which I had already a year earlier suggested in one of my letters to Nahum
Goldman -- there is an attempt to obtain a collective statement of the Allied governments on the
extermination of the Jews. And this text is finally -- this is the real, immediate result of my
telegram, is the declaration of the -- all the Allied governments -- which is of the 17th of
December, 1942, where all the Allied governments and the French National Committee -- was
not yet a government -- had solemnly denounced the extermination of the Jewish people, saying
that this has been many times announced, threatened with, and now it is happening, and hundreds
of thousands of people have already been killed, and they threatened with the retaliation -- with
the punishment of those who are responsible. This is a great moment. Now the story is out.
And it is published all over. And even in the very careful, neutral Switzerland, it makes the first
pages in the newspapers. And one hopes now something will happen that something should
happen. And now starts a discussion between the two major Allied governments which goes on
for six weeks, and nothing is happening. You can read the pathetic appeal from the Archbishop
of Canterbury in the House of Lords and this, where he accuses the governments of complete
inactivity and of being responsible for their not undertaking any action. Even if you cannot do
anything, you have to try at least. And finally, after two months practically, it is decided there
will be a conference between the British and the Americans, and they decide to hold this
conference in the Bermudas, in the Atlantic.
Q. Let me stop you there for a minute and back up for two things. One, the information that
Washington and London were trying to get confirmed, in spite of the fact that the Vatican did not
supply much information, the Americans did ultimately get additional information, including

indirectly some information from Carl Burckhardt, and I wonder if you could talk about how
that...
A. Yes. I will come to this now. I have skipped one thing, and that the meeting with the
American minister in October 1942. Let me first say, when I saw that nothing was happening
and that everybody was skeptical about the reports -- and this you feel, and you see that nothing
is happening I was never in my life as desperate as during these weeks, when you know that the
world is burning and nothing is happening, and on the contrary, I am sitting in Geneva on this
beautiful lake with my view on the Mont Blanc, and the blue sky, and you know --
Q. Which you could see from your office?
A. Hmm? I saw this from my office. I was having an office with a beautiful view, and already
three, four kilometers around are the Germans and the Italians. And the whole world is in
flames, and you see this beauty of the lake and the mountains and the sky, and it's a provocation
to your existence. And I am waiting and waiting to any reaction positive, and nothing comes.
So I am trying to -- to get information, other information. But on this I must say I was quite
successful. There were four major confirmations which I obtained, direct or indirect. The first
were some letters which were addressed to the Jewish relief organization of the Aguda in
Switzerland, addressed by a man who lived outside the ghetto in Warsaw, and which was sent to
Lucerne, informing them in a certain coded language, with Hebrew words and other words, of
the beginning of the deportation of the Jews of Warsaw, which started -- and this we know -- on
the 25th of July, the day when Czerniakow, the Judenaelteste, committed suicide. And every day

six thousand people were taken and -- from the Umschlagplatz to Treblinka. And they write in
two letters in this kind of coded language that the people are being taken day by day to this
camp. And the words are clear -- it is gayROOSH. It is complete extermination and killing, and
so there is for the first time a confirmation even from Poland that this extermination is happening
there. Number two, at the beginning of September, I believe, comes to Switzerland a young man
who saw the extermination of the total Jewish population of Riga in November and December
1941. That means nine months or ten months before. A young man, a student of medicine, who
escaped from Riga, worked for several months in a hospital as a non-Jew, and a hospital in
Stettin, and finally succeeds to get a visa for Switzerland where he has some relatives. And
when he arrives in Geneva, I am informed, and I have a meeting with him, and I question him for
six or eight hours about what he knew, and he gives a very detailed report of how in two nights
the Nazis -- ?, was military -- killed by machine guns -- I think thirty-six thousand or something
Jews in two nights, among whom the very famous Jewish historian, Simon Dubnow, who was,
by the way, very near the ideals of the World Jewish Congress and whom we revered very much.
Nobody knew about this. For nine months the world was completely silent, that you can't kill
such -- do such exterminations without anybody knowing. It showed that -- what was going on
was terrible. The third was even more intriguing. One day I get a telephone call from a doctor
in the Jewish -- in the hospital, a Jewish doctor in the hospital of Geneva, very fine lady, good
friend of mine, said, "Come here. I have to show you something very interesting," and it's worth
my coming. And I go to the hospital, and she receives me -- she's dead also now -- and says, "I
have here a very strange patient. He is under police surveillance, and you are not allowed to see
him, and you are not allowed to mention it, but I cannot begrudge. You know much more the --
go and see him." And I spent six hours in the hospital and take down what this fellow tells me.

And it's -- as I always say, in extraordinary times are extraordinary events. A young man who is
taken in -- Antwerp or Brussels -- this I forgot -- in Belgium, in one of these mass arrests, and
being sent to the camp in Malines, from where they are deported to the east. And he gives me
the exact description on what happened every day in the process of deportation, from Malines in
Belgium to Krakow, Katowice, up to Russia, where he finally ends up in -- near -- the front of
Stalingrad, near Rava Ruskaya. And then he describes every station, what happened, and so on.
Not only he tells me he was in -- put down, put to -- engaged in works for the fortification at the
front. And one day, an officer comes and asks somebody whether -- who could drive? He needs
a driver. And as he is a mechanic, working in -- was a Polish Jew living in Belgium, working in
some mechanic(al) establishment, he offers himself, and he is taken. And he is -- ten days going
with the German officer, accompanying him in his travels in the car. And he uses this pportunity
to ask the German officer, "What happened? What happened there? What happened here?
Why?" And the German officer, who is fed up with the war, lost already two of his brothers,
tells him, "It's very simple. Those who are up to work, they take them to work. Those who are
not up to work, they be exterminated. Those who are not any more up to work, they have the
same fate." So easy it was. In three sentences, the whole tragedy of the Jewish people was
described by this German officer. And the German officer, as I said, who was fed up with the
war, decides to save this Jew. In an unbelievable story, he hides him in a train full of uniforms
of people who fell in the battles around Stalingrad, and hides him in this train and gives him food
and gives him occupation mark, and said, "You remain in the train until it stops. And then you
can try to get out." And he leaves -- I don't know -- four or five days. He didn't know himself
how long it was. And finally this train stops. Finally, didn't move any more. And he gets out,
and he is near the Gare de I'Est in Paris. Now, you imagine from Stalingrad practically, or Rava

Ruskaya, to -- to Paris. And he -- he has some occupation marks. He finds his way, he goes to
the Plaetzl, finds Jewish advice, goes to the nonoccupied France and finds the way. He comes
over the mountains of Switzerland and is arrested by some of the soldiers, and as he is typical --
as for many people deported -- swollen feet and -- and bones and legs. They bring him to the
hospital to be treated. And there he is. Unbelievable that such things are possible. But I
questioned him. You know, I was a kind of a judge once -- inquisition judge in the proceedings
which I had in the tribunal in Berlin. And I questioned him for hours and hours. Very simple
person, straightforward, and there was no doubt that what he said was the truth. And yet he gave
the whole story. From an eyewitness who had seen it. And then comes the fourth, the most
interesting in certain ways. When we had the idea -- we had the report from Schulte. I
suggested to Gugenheim that we should ask the Red Cross whether they had any reports which
confirmed. And making it not too official, we decided that he should privately ask the vice
president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Carl Burckhardt, who is a colleague
of his in the institute which I spoke, the Institute de Hautes Etudes Internationales, and he should
ask him in the professors’ lounge -- not in a formal way, but in a more private, confidential way.
And he does this, and -- somewhere in the beginning of September. And Burkhardt confirms to
him that his reports are very similar, that he has confirmation from two German diplomats, the
one from a member of the staff of the German foreign office, the other, a representative of the
military establishment. He says "Defense Department."
Q. War Ministry, yeah.

A. War Ministry. It seems that this was not a very correct description, but it's clear that he
meant the military establishment. And very interesting. He uses the words which are the key
words in this whole process that means "Judenfrei", make the countries "Judenfrei.". When you
read the reports which Heidrich made to Ribbentrop, the regular reports about the progress of the
extermination process in the various countries, in all of these reports, you see "Judenfrei." And
Burckhardt knows -- says "Judenfrei" as he says, well -- there is no possibility of settlement or of
emigration. It is clear that it means in reality the killing of the people. Now, this, of course, is
extremely important. And Gugenheim was doubtful whether I should use this information. In
any case -- I will come to it in a moment -- shortly after, we were invited by the American
minister in Bern, Lichtheim and myself, to report to him what we knew about the whole process.
This was suggested by Wise to Sumner Welles, and -- and we were invited by the American
minister. And knowing what it was all about, because Wise informed us, put all what you have
on the table to let people -- I saw they didn't believe us. Maybe now is the moment or never.
And we write together a memorandum of about thirty-five pages, with a short introduction. And
then we add all the reports which we have and some general evaluation of the situation in various
countries, with all the annexes and the documents, including these letters from Warsaw,
including the Sivian (?) report, including the report from the man who was in Rava Ruskaya and
Stalingrad. All together it's about thirty-five pages.
Q. Stop there. Because they're about to run out of tape. We'll talk about your meeting you and
Lichtheim, meeting with Harrison.
A. Yeah.

Q. Okay. Save that for the next tape.
A. They have to change?
Q. Yes.
Q. Dr. Riegner, you were about to tell us about the information, the memorandum you brought
in for the American minister, Leland Harrison, in October.
A. Now, I felt very seriously that this was the decisive date. Either they will believe us or they
will not believe us. And, therefore, I was decided to tell all I knew, including the name of the
person from whom the original report came. And we agreed that we would not pronounce the
name, but we would put it on a piece of paper and give it to the minister in a closed envelope,
and this is what happened. On the other hand, I also decided that I had to inform the minister
that the -- about the Burckhardt interview of Gugenheim. I felt that this was an extremely
important, positive support for our whole story, and I had to tell it. Gugenheim was not very
happy about this. He felt it was more of personal information, and I disregarded it and told the
minister the whole story. I said to him that I doubt that Gugenheim would confirm it in this way,
but without naming the person, he may. It was -- the meeting with the minister was extremely
interesting. He read -- I never had such a meeting with any diplomat in my life. When he saw
that we had prepared the memorandum, he immediately took it and started reading it. We were
in the room for probably twenty-five, thirty minutes without any word was spoken. When he had

finished, he started again and asked questions. What he thought of it, we couldn't guess.
Lichtheim, with a good sense of humor, said, "Mr. Poker Face." And he looked like a poker
face. But as a matter of fact, as we know today, we convinced him on that date. He didn't
believe us before. But the documentation, it convinced him, and he obviously gave a positive
recommendation. I don't know. You may have readed -- read what exactly he wrote. I have
never seen it. But it is clear that from that moment on, he was on our side. He asked that
Gugenheim should make an affidavit about what we told him, and he asked an affidavit from
Sivian, and the name of the other fellow was -- whom I met in the hospital I didn't give him. I
didn't want to make trouble for the doctor who let us in. But I gave it later in a special letter to
the embassy so they knew, also, that the man -- and maybe they have approached him. I don't
know.
Q. Sivian was the Latvian who described the massacres outside of Riga?
A. Yeah. But the -- the other fellow was -- not -- the name escapes me at the moment, but I
have it if you want. And I gave him -- gave them the address, too. He was in the meantime in
some of the internment camps in Switzerland. Well, then -- then something happened which I
didn't know. He sent the consul in Geneva, Mr. Squire, to Burckhardt behind our back, and
interviewed them, what he knew about the extermination policy and what he knew from the
Germans. And as a matter of fact, Burckhardt repeated to Squire exactly what he had told us.
There are two notes from Squire which Mr. Moos found in the files of the State Department and
which he sent to me afterwards. It is exactly the same what he said to -- to Gugenheim. That --
the very strange fact remains that Burckhardt has never said these things to his own colleagues

on the International Committee of the Red Cross. Professor FalVAY, who had access to
everything -- all the files in the International Red Cross, who has seen practically everything,
confirms that there is no trace whatsoever of this. And the strange thing is that Burckhardt tells
very proudly to Squire that there was a proposal of -- making a protest or appeal to the Germans
on the part of the Red Cross, and he -- he doesn't tell him that he was against it and voted against
it and stopped it. He presents it as if this was a great positive fact which he supported. Now,
these are very strange things. And it's not very clear. I have my ideas about this, why he did
this.
Q. Do you want to tell us what you --
A. I think it should really come somewhere else.
Q. Allright.
A. It doesn't fit in in the story at the moment. But when we speak about the Red Cross, we can
perhaps come back to it. So when this -- all these documents are arriving in Washington, in
November, then everybody is now convinced that we -- we have a case and we are right. Three
months or more have passed. Every day, thousands of Jews have been killed. And nothing has
happened in the meantime. But now Sumner welles allows Wise to go public, and he does.
Some people say it wasn't published in -- sufficient publicity. Maybe yes, maybe no. In any
case, the matter is public. And this now leaves -- and here I made a mistake -- I went already to
the Declaration of the 17th of December. Perhaps we can turn this around in the tape. We -- we

get to this Declaration which was published simultaneously in Washington, in London, and in
Moscow on the 17th of December, and -- denouncing the extermination of the Jewish people and
threatening the responsible with punishment after the war. In London, it is done in the form of a
question in Parliament to the government, and Sydney Silverman asked this question, which
Eden replies. And a very moving gesture: The whole Parliament stands up for two minutes to
pay tribute, homage to the victims. And a man -- Eden himself says he was struck by the
emotion which prevailed in the House. And a man like Lloyd George, who was the oldest
member of the Parliament, said he had never seen anything alike in the history of the British
Parliament. But this, of course, didn't make the people alive again. And we wait now for
action. And as I said, there are negotiations, and finally it is decided to meet in the Bermudas
and to discuss what action is to be taken. This is the moment where the Jewish organizations in
America, everywhere outside in the free world, get very active and devise an actions program of
what should be done and what can be done. And this program is being formulated and -- with
fifteen points. We may be coming back on some of the points when we say what happened and
what didn't happen. In any case, it's not true that the Jews were not prepared for action, but the
governments were not prepared for action. That is the truth. And Bermuda is chosen so that the
-- the public cannot follow too much what's going on. Nobody is allowed access to the
conference. The whole thing is kept in great secret, and the great secret that only comes out very
slowly -- the great secret is that they didn't decide anything. Now, when this becomes true, when
this becomes public, when this gets out, this is the most crucial moment in the whole history of
the war for the Jewish community. And the people are completely shaken. Yitzhak Greenberg,
one of the very respected members of the Jewish community here, of the labor -- Jewish labor
movement, writes a famous article, "Bankrupt," and at this moment, in effect, it was complete

bankruptcy. Now we come later back to the reason why nothing was undertaken. But here the
most important thing is this: There have been attacks later against the leadership and especially
against Stephen Wise and the Zionist leadership that they did not use their influence to push
through a program. And they are accused of having sacrificed the rescue effort to the --
Q. Zionist cause?
A. -- to the importance of the fight for the establishment of a Jewish state. This is, in my
opinion, a very unjust accusation. They -- one puts the cart before the horse. In reality, what has
happened is that for the first time, the Jewish establishment understands that it cannot in this
tragic situation count on our best friends. It's a bankruptcy of the effort of rescue, which puts
everybody into the position that if we cannot count on our best friends in such a tragic situation,
then we have to have ourselves some sovereignty so that we can act. It is not the sacrifice of the
rescue effort to the idea of establishment of a state. But the establishment of the state is the aim
-- the first aim in the Jewish war aims. It is the consequence of the bankruptcy of the rescue
effort, of being abandoned by our best friends in whom we counted that they would do
something. And it's very unjust to confuse these issues. And I think we have to correct this and
we have to make this understood. Wise has always tried still. He was not the naive person
many people want to see in him. There is a letter which he writes to Nahum Goldman in -- I
think it's April 1943, just during the time of the Bermuda conference. And Goldman is -- for the
Passover holiday somewhere in the countryside. And Wise keeps him informed in this letter and
writes to him, "The things are as we foresaw, going very bad, and from bad to worse. Some
people say we should publicly denounce the President. I believe this would be a mistake. He

can still try. If we attack him, too, it will deprive us of our last support, and it will only give
great satisfaction to the Congress, which is a really anti-Semitic Congress -- in this country."
Such letters -- and it should be shown in your archives here -- show that he was by far not a
naive person whom people want him to be, that he was by far not blindly following Roosevelt in
these things. The relationship between Wise and Roosevelt went up and down in various ways,
and it's not so simple at all. But he had great admiration for Roosevelt. There is no doubt. And
what Roosevelt did and what Roosevelt did not do I think is one of the points which we have to
discuss also in the following discussions. This chapter, therefore, ends with a terrible negative
despair. Nothing is happening, and we are attending, we are assisting at the killing of millions of
Jews without any active counteraction. I did not stop making proposals and reporting. I was
terribly pessimistic. But my feeling was, you have to try, and if you don't succeed, you have to
try again and you have to try again. And I had enough energy to keep this through. My good
friend Lichtheim was even more pessimistic than I. And he wrote lots of letters, description
which are today very valuable because they show the situation as it was. I wrote much less
letters. I didn't like to write open letters through the mail which I knew would all fall into
German hands and through the German censorship. But I tried -- over again and again to get
some ideas through and some rescue proposals. And there are a number of very important
reports, which you will find in the files of the Congress, in January 1943 and later, and one of the
most important is the report of the telegram of April 1943, in which I make again a number of
very important rescue proposals. This telegram had also its special fate. In the meantime, the
State Department had instructed the embassy in Bern not to transmit any more private messages
or messages of private organizations. It is in reality meant against me. The reason was if we cut
off the source, then the Jewish organizations in New York cannot cry and cannot push us and

cannot threaten us. It was a very simple way. But when -- in April, the consul in Geneva and
the minister in Bern saw that I had very important proposals to make, they didn't understand why
they shouldn't communicate this to Washington. They considered it very important. So finally --
they didn't tell me that they had these instructions. But they -- they said there were some
problems. Finally, they came to a very funny conclusion, whether I was ready to pay for the
telegram. So I was puzzled by this proposal. And I said immediately "Yes." It was the most
expensive telegram I ever sent in my life. It was practically a full salary -- although my salary
wasn't very high -- but nearly two hundred dollars it was. You can imagine for what I worked at
the time. And I said, "Yes." In the long run, it was a very cheap telegram. It put into action
--really, it led to the establishment of the War Refugee Board, of all the actions which were
undertaken. And when you put it in relation to this, it was a very, very cheap, cheap telegram.

In any case, this telegram suggested two great actions. One was the rescue action in Romania. I
had been informed by the Jewish community leaders in Romania through the Red Cross that
there was a change in attitude of Marshall Antonescu and the Minister of the Interior with regard
to the Jews and there may be possibilities of emigration from the Jews in Transnistria to
Palestine. Now, this was sensational news, of course. And they asked -- but they needed funds
for this. And the funds -- and there was a very original idea, that the funds would not have to be
transferred to Romania, but could be put in a -- in a blocked account in Switzerland until the end
of the war. Now, this was a very attractive and sensational idea. The second was the effort --
and this came from the people who were in the Jewish underground in France, Belgium, and
Holland -- a concerted effort to evacuate as many youngsters and children from these three
countries towards Spain or towards Switzerland. And that they needed for this money, they
needed for this weapons, they needed for this all kinds of material. They needed machines to

falsify papers, identity papers, ration cards, and so on, and so on. And this was the second great
proposal. When this telegram arrived in New York, they went to the Jewish authorities. The
matter was brought to Roosevelt himself and to Morgenthau, and apparently they agreed with the
plans. Although this was really going out of the normal ways. But April passed, May passed,
June passed. In July, Stephen Wise goes to Morgenthau, and says, "What happens? Nothing has
happened. Where are you?" Mr. Morgenthau says, "I don't know. We have agreed for a long
time that this should happen." And there he charges two of his assistants, Bader (Baylor ?) and
DuBois, to find out what happened. And there comes the famous report of the two Protestant
assistants of Morgenthau after having approached some of the people in the State Department,
and they find out that the whole -- sabotage which is taking place in the State Department all the
time, from the beginning of the suppression of my cable, from the instruction not to send any
cables to me, up to the sabotage of this great rescue plan. And they write a report for
Morgenthau, which they -- to which they give. The report is published. Everybody can read it
today. It's a terrible indictment against the Department and is -- they give it the title, "On the
Acquiescence of This Government in the Mass Murder of the Jews." Now, Morgenthau agrees,
but the title is, after all, a little bit too strong, and he calls it "Report to the President." But he is
more clever than to give them -- him the report. He asks his legal advisor, Professor Cox, to
prepare a positive proposal of how to deal with these matters. And he comes with the idea of a
refugee -- War Refugee Board composed of representatives of the State Department, the reasury,
and the War Department, which should be entrusted with the special task to deal with the
problems of the victims of Nazi persecution and the help which can be given to them. Roosevelt
sees that the report of the two assistants is dynamite and sees that something has to be done and
accepts quite favorably the idea of the War Refugee Board. But in the meantime, Morgenthau is

clever enough not to antagonize too much the State Department and -- what's his name?
Secretary of State?
Q. Cordell Hull?
A. Cordell Hull. Cordell Hull.
Q. Okay. Hull was --
A. Yeah, yeah. And he makes some approaches, and Cordell Hull gives in, and suddenly
something happens and nobody understands why. I am called on the day before Christmas,
23rd or '4th of 1943, to the legation in Bern, and say, "What? What have you done? The whole
policy and the -- on the financial blockade and the food blockade, it's all set aside. What
happened? What?" And I didn't know what happened. This was Wise's and Morgenthau's doing
here. In any case, full of admiration, I get handed out a document, the first license in which the
World Jewish Congress is authorized to send to me as the first amount, twenty-five thousand
dollars for rescue activity in favor of victims of Nazi persecution. And one tells me that I can
make proposals to change the text, and so on, and that it is only a first gesture, and if it works
well, it can be repeated, and so on, and enlarged, and so on. But it is really a breakthrough,
complete breakthrough. And what we know today is that in the last moment, the British embassy
in Bern tried on the request of the Ministry of —

A. -- Economic Welfare to stop this thing. And it holds up the whole thing for two weeks, I
believe. But it is finally accepted. So this was really a Christmas gift. And then they really
didn't know what happened and how it got -- my shares went up very high in the embassy.
Q. Hanukkah came on Christmas that year?
A. It was. Yeah. It was on Christmas. And now, the -- the rules were very strict and
unworkable, and I immediately said that this is not possible in this way. I made certain
observations. After a few days, they -- they changed the rules and gave it a better formula and
less strict, and then without my commenting again, a third text came in. And the third text
comes in the day which the War Refugee Board is created. You see the direct link of this action
with the creation of the War Refugee Board. And now we worked under this, I have to report,
and it's very complicated. But it is a breakthrough. And the establishment of the War Refugee
Board is really the one great positive decision which has been made. I am not saying it -- | am
not saying it's -- whatever, the War Refugee Board was wonderful, but at least it was a serious
effort to help. And from this moment on, we got support of all the embassies all over Europe, in
Stockholm and in Bern, and in Turkey, in Ankara, and in Spain, and in Portugal. And we really
felt the government behind us. And something which is most important, during the last year,
from January 1944 to end of May, the end of the war, in May, '45, that twenty million dollars
were channeled through the War Refugee Board -- Jewish money, not other money --this we also
have to talk -- were channeled to -- for efforts to rescue Jews, to help Jews and other victims of
Nazi persecution. It is the one great thing which has happened. And I am very happy that this
came out of my normal activities, and it was directly linked to these plans, the plans themselves,

the Romanian situation. It could never be reestablished. Antonescu changed his mind. It wasn't
possible. The situation -- the whole plan fell through because it was eight months between when
I suggested it and when it happened. The other question of the help for the rescue of the children
and youngsters, and bringing them out to Spain and to Switzerland. It was -- was applied. This
is one of the three great parts in the rescue efforts in which I took the -- a personal -- a personal
part. But this is the -- really the story. It took eighteen months from my first report in August
until something at all was done. And I tell you, it was one of the most terrible times in my life. I
saw one report after another, full of gloom and disaster, and waiting for the world to react, and --
and nothing was happening. It was really the moment of our greatest need, and we were terribly
lonely and abandoned during that whole period, and during this period millions of Jews were
killed.
Q. Now, let me go back for a second to the Romanian situation. I know that the plan to have
Jews emigrate from Romania did not work in part because of German objections and Romanian
objections. But I was under the impression that that scheme of using money, money deposited in
Swiss accounts, then was used to persuade people within Romania itself to lend money to keep
Jews in Romania itself alive. Now, I don't know that the World Jewish Congress was involved
in that, but —
A. No. There was something -- I don't know. I wasn't any more involved there. But Kolb one
of the Red Cross people helped in this respect. The details I don't know. But the whole thing
was this idea, to finance things and to be paid at the end of the war. It worked not only there. It
worked also in France and other places. I know that we paid a lots of money later for what our
friends in France had taken as loans, and we were presented with it, and the Joint, the same. This

was a great, great part. But there was a political change. There was a certain moment where the
other -- Antonescu had greater power, I think, and that disappeared apparently afterwards. But
the details I forgot. You know, something which doesn't work, you don't -- you are not so
interested any more. You are interested in things which work. But I believe it's -- what I have
now to say is what the -- thanks to the War Refugee Board -- functioned and what didn't
function, and there are a certain number of things in which they have certainly helped. There is
criticism they could have done. The greatest criticism, of course, is that it started in January, '44.
Could have started in '42 instead of in '44. And this is one thing. But on the other hand, I must
say -- I didn't say it until now -- my great hero is Morgenthau. Without him we would never
have had this. He really pushed it through with Roosevelt. There is no doubt. His assistants
discovered and disclosed what happened. This in itself is a great service. And by the way, when
Morgenthau had his seventieth birthday -- no. When Wise had his seventieth birthday, orgenthau
made a speech and said he would never forget. And Wise and Jimmy, his son, came to him and
showed him the telegram which I did. And then after the war, Wise sent me to Morgenthau. He
would like to make your acquaintance. And I was with him for an hour and a half. He
questioned me about the people, and so on. When I came in, he looked at me. He is a very tall
fellow, you know. I am not so tall -- and looked at me -- the face, a little at an angle, said, "So,
this is the fellow who changed my life." This was what he said to me. Which, of course, moved
me very much. But he became back a Jude -- Jew. And this was very, very far away. But I
revere Morgenthau -- not for the Morgenthau plan, which didn't function in any case, but also for
generally what he did, together with the friend and assistant of the president -- in the White
House.

Q. Harry Hopkins.
A. Yeah. They together supported the Lend and Lease. Hopkins. And Morgenthau supported
him. Without Lend and Lease, I don't know whether Britain would have come through the war.
This is a decisive moment, and it's not an accident, that in the general scene and on the Jewish
scene, Morgenthau was deeply involved. Imagine for a moment what would have happened if
Britain would have gone down. It would not be only Britain. It would not only be 400,000

Jewish in Britain being under Hitler. It would be the breakdown in Palestine and the Middle
East. The 600,000 Jews in Palestine who are today the basis of the Jewish Renaissance and of
the Jewish state. Imagine that the British government would have gone down and Alexandria
would be open to Rommel, and they would have gone into Israel. The whole idea of Israel
would have disappeared. You cannot even imagine it, what this may be, because we are living in
this world.
Q. Well, the whole course of the war might have been different. It might have gone on years
longer, with millions of more people dying who knows where?
A. Nobody knows. But that certainly -- that another million Jews would have been under
Hitler. And the present situation of the Renaissance of the Jewish people would be wiped out,
and no -- nobody can even imagine what this would have been if -- if Britain had been -- had
gone under. And this is the part where -- where we owe gratitude to Roosevelt. He didn't do
enough. He didn't do much to help us. But it is certain it prevented -- this additional catastrophe
and this part of the war, too, which we shouldn't forget. And I, personally, with all my
reservations and -- that the most decent person was Mrs. Roosevelt in this whole thing. She at
least tried, but she didn't prevail upon her husband, either. I must say that this shouldn't be
forgotten, either. And it wouldn't have happened without Hopkins and Morgenthau, who gave it
from the beginning -- and this results very clearly from the Gilbert book on Churchill, the great
part he played in this. I therefore, I said my hero in this whole story is Morgenthau. And -- my
personal memory is very moved by the words with which he greeted me when I met him at the
time. Now, I think we can finish here. This is a good moment to finish.

up the next time right here? Do you want to stop here for now?

A. And we are already an hour late.

next time.

other question. I think we made quite a progress now.

A:. .in in...when I was in Budapest. This was still the Budapest under Communist regime. It was
very difficult to have conversations. You were, of course, followed everywhere and you
were under supervision everywhere and you had to be very careful what you talked
about, and more was a delightful (laugher) subject which nobody could uh uh object to.
And so I told one evening this story and and uh the dinner where I was invited and the
major Jewish uh personalities of the various groups, they they...all through those
communities, the liberal community, Zionist...they were all there and uh the result was
that a few months uh weeks later, I got from the office of the World Jewish Congress in
Budapest a letter, saying you told us this interesting...

BREAK IN TAPE

...and report what they lived through. And we have here about four thousand such uh witnesses
and there are some which write and speak about uh the and the . Are you interested in
these .. reports? Now I personally, of course, I was interested but uh the uh those who
really needed it was uh the the international authority pursuing the the , so«I looked for
an opportunity to get in touch with the people who were involved in the in the uh
prosecution of the people and I wrote a letter and there was no uh personal
communication since Germany was still completely cut out from the circulation, normal
circulation, and uh and I learned that Kastner was asked to uh to go as a witness to
Nuremburg and they asked him to take a letter to uh to Nuremburg and give it to the uh
uh competent prosecutor. And he did this, and when he came back he told me the story
which was very uh stranger He didn't...this was typical of Kastner. He didn't just give the
letter (laughter) to to the prosecutor who was Mr., the assistant...the former assistant of

of uh . He, by the way, has written a full book about the uh the prosecution about against
and the and so on, and when he came to...when Kastner came to , whom he didn't of
course know, he was there in order to give witness in the case against Baker (ph) and the
people with whom he had cooperated, and when he gave the the letter, the prosecutor
looked at the signaturea found my signature, and said something like, hum, very reliable.
Very reliable. Now he was, of course, fascinated and flabbergasted... how does this man
know my name with all, and (coughing) and asked him. Then he told him, you know, this
i8 a long story. I can't tell you this now but if you have time in the evening, we can go
have dinner together and I'll tell you the story. And so it .. happened, and it happened that
he told him the whole story which you'll find them in Morganthal's diaries which were
published in Collier's a few months later. I heard this story the first time from Kastner.
Was a little bit uh doubtful, but when I came uh uh a month or two months later to the
United States, this issue of Collier's appeared, while I was there, and for the first time the
whole story came out and uh I must say I was very impressed by by the . They are very
fine uh uh civil servants and we owe them much that this sabotage will see uh State
Department, they came out and and was acknowledged. There was a clear line in the
State Department which really didn't want to be cooperative. I think the head of it was
Breckenridge Long (ph), uh one of the higher officials in the State Department who was
put there by Roosevelt because he or his family had given considerable funds to to the
election...electoral funds of Roosevelt, but really the the policy which they pursued I
don't think really were in the line of of Rooseveltts liberal attitudes. Uh Breckenridge
Long really considered his holy duty to keep the Jews out of America. I think this can
without reservation be affirmed.

A:This I have heard many times. I personally believe that this i8 highly exaggerated. Uh I
believe one can argue very uh uh with with great justification that my telegram of April
1943 with all the proposals it contained, uh has led directly to the establishment of the of
the uh uh refugee board. I think when when these proposals were submitted to
Morganthal and , and were approved by both, and nothing happened, and found out in
July which means several months later that nothing happened and went to Morganthal
and complained, and that led to the decisive action of Morganthal. One...in the asking of
the report asking the two assistants the boys they paid to find out what really happened,
and number two, he he he...really on the basis of this reportt he was able to go to the
President and to complain. Thirdly, he was able at the same time, not only to present this
famous report on the acquiescence of this government in the mass murder of the Jews, he
was able to use this opportunity to come with a positive suggestion, and this positive
suggestion he had uh prepared it with his uh legal advisor, Professor , and this was the
idea of the War Refugee Board. Now uh I believe he has a direct line. As a matter of fact,
uh even the way in which the matters proceeded, uh when I got just before Christmas the
first license, and I talked about this already, and then the revised form ten days later and
then another revised form uh making business easier. Uh had made all kinds of criticism
of the strictness of the uh . Again, about two weeks or three weeks later, and the second
revised form is really the day when the War Refugee Board was established and the
facility of these licenses extended to everybody. Now here is a very clear line to show
that this was really the outcome of these plans which I had submitted and which
Morganthal picked up and and used as the major uh material in order to ask the President
finally to act. He was uh a great politician. He himself used some of the uh propaganda of
Birksen (ph) to put it...to the disposal of his _i own policy. But he used it. It was not that
they had really the decisive influence. There are uh for a long time plans from this
extremist groups uh that they had decisive influence on things as they developed. I

contest this very much. I think that uh they may have had an influence on public opinion
at certain moments to uh raise the consciousness of the the public, which I will not
contest, but on the real action I don't think they had any decisive influence.

Q:Uh what were the most important actions of the War Refugee Board as you see it?

A:Well, let me say... mean the War Refugee Board has also been criticized a number of times
and said that certainly, rightlyt it was too late. It was much too late. It was...it came into
force in the beginning of uh 1944. If it would have been established a year earlier or two
years earlier, it would have been probably much more efficient, but nevertheless, it was
mainly the only decisive action which was taken, and the whole situation changed uh all
over. We had really the support of the American embassies and legatlons all over. In in
Stockholm and in Lisbon .. and in and in Bern, and in Ankara and so on. And this never
happened before. Here is really, and this you have to acknowledge even if you're perhaps
critical on some of the actions he could have done more, but it was a decisive effect.
Number two...during the period during which it was active, that means generally '44 to ,' |
i May '45...this early the end of the war, uh twenty million dollars have been uced, Jewish
money...I come to this later...twenty million dollars have been used in order to alleviate
the fate of the persecuted, the Nazi persecuted victims, Jews and lots of nonJews, uh but
the great majority, of course, Jews, and the the money was Jewish money. Now with this
money, lots of things have been done but it was not only the money. It was also the
determination to explore all possibilities by which Jews uh people...victims could be
helped and and the uh action of the Nazis counter-acted. Uh my opinion, there were a
number of things which were finally uh were obtained. Uh on the one hand, for instance,
there were a few uh...which has nothing to do directly with the War Refugee Board but it
has to be mentioned as something which has has happened...uh the exchange uh uh
agreements. There was a number of of uh prisoners of war who especially wounded and

and heavily wounded who were exchanged as through the Red Cross, and there was a
great number of Palestinian Jews amongst them. I Aaw the the train passing through
Geneva. Uh these were important actions. The second is a certain...I'm not
exaggerating...a aertain alleviation of the situation in the neutral aountries. Uh not direct
guarantees were given, but they were encouraged and they were told .. well, we will help
you after the war to distribute the people that not...shouldn't be only on on on your
charge. This could have been much more energetically pursued, in my opinion
(coughing) and it should have been. I believe that Switzerland could have taken in the
double or the triple of of people which they they took in, and w they're they're not so
many countries who can say they took as many as Switzerland did, but but...and this was
the general situation. But this was important. Then the what I said referred indirectly of
any..the end of the uh financial blockade and of the food blockade in favor of the victims.
This is really a great decision, and I quoted how I was received in Bern when the first
license came and they were very astonished because the British had blockade and so the
ministry of uh..-I don't remember...economic warfare I think it was the name in
Britain...uh tried to stop the license until the last moment, and in fact it was given to me
several weeks after it was also was to be delivered. Now this was really important. Uh
really there was no no uh lack of money any more. If you really wanted to do something,
the money was available. Uh I wouldn't say that Sonny Meyer (ph) and others who
disposed _ , they had some problems there. And we certainly had problems, uh couldn't
raise the money in Europe at the time, (coughing) and the the food blockade. I mean I
never...I think I said it already...I never observed a food blockade. I uh 1 disobeyed my
colleagues and my superiors in America in this matter. They were not very happy, but ". I
considered that I was in a neutral country and I could use uh and .\ should use whatever I
could in helping starving Jews in the occupied territories and this would...but a great
action. I think , it was engaged and food passes by the Joint through the International Red
Cross. T think they gave them a million dollars or something like it, and this was done

now under in a in a very...in a much larger uh uh proportion as it was possible before. : . !
8 I myself...the the Congress...the World Congress office in Geneva has uh during the
war sent hundreds of thousands of of parcels, uh mostly from Portugal, small parcels but
uh which certainly have have helped thousands and thousands of people to survive.

Q:Let me stop you there for a second. They have to fix something in the room. They're shutting
off the tape. Just a few seconds...

Q:Dr.Riegner, you were telling us about the actions that the War Refugee Board took or made
possible.

A:Yes. Uh I spoke about the uh the big . Now uh the next point I would like to underline is the
support which was given to the actlvities of the underground uh in order to help Jews on
the spot uh to survive through uh thanks to false papers which were used in great masses,
uh papers of every kind uh especially uh ration cards which had to be renewed every
month uh could use in the tens of thousands and the hundred thousands probably. Identity
papers, false identity papers, uh baptismal certificates which were of course not , but uh
showed that the people were not Jews, uh uh working permits, uh every kind of identity
and uh identity cards and so on which could be used in very very larte masses...uh
numbers and uh we had in France but particularly groups who were charged with this job.
And it was not only this helped uh tens of thousands of people to maintain themselves, to
hide and to somehow disappear under the general population. On the other hand, there
was a special service established in western Europe by the Jewish uh resistance
movement which tried particularly to organize the immigration of Jewish youngsters uh
towards spain and Portugal and then the free world, or towards Switzerland. And uh these
groups uh were extremely successful They brought several thousand children to
Switzerland, a number of them with their parents. There were several hundred parents

also came. Uh there were a considerable number of youngsters accompanied by armed uh
uh conduct to the Spanish frontier and uh then they came out to the $ree world. Uh this
is...was one of the most successful activities and covered, as I said, thousands of people.
Uh of course, you would have liked to do much more. It was directed outside particular
by my colleague Mark Yahblume (ph) who was one of the French leaders who wrote
from nineteen hundred and fortythree and nineteen hundred to the end of the war...was
nearly end of the war in Geneva in my office, and we did this together. Uh he got money
from the World Jewish Congress, from the Jewish agency, from the Joint, from the trade
union movement, and uh altogether this was by the way one of the finest compilation and
and rescue of of all kinds thanks to a person uh which was accepted in and which
was...who was active in thi6 and kept the uh contact with the groups in in the occupied
territories. Uh this is one of the finest things I think uh which took place and I'm very
proud to have been personally involved in this and have helped in this. Another very
important action and this was the political . . 10 action to save uh whatever could be
saved of the Hungarian Jews in 1945. Uh here again something happened which is very
strange. We knew uh and I was responsible to warn before the Hungary was even
occupied. You can see in the files telegrams which I sent and and...several weeks before
the actual started of the occupation of Hungary, and immediately when it was undertaken,
there's another great telegram where I asked uh what should be done in order to
counteract it and it should be made public counteractions so the medias or the radio and
so on, through t-he free radio from London and the and the...it should be very...an action
encouraging not to cooperate with the Nazis, encouraging the non-Jews to help the Jews,
to hide them and 80 on. There's a whole program which uh they have suggested to the
free world and which was uh I believe to a certain degree used in uh by the the media and
so on. But uh | uh the strange thing which happened in the case of the Hungarian Jews
was that uh from March to June uh 1944, there came practically no direct news out from
Hungary, except what we read in the newspapers t in the legal gazettes and so on. So

what legally happened we knew, but that in these three months, half the Jews of Hungary
were sent to to to Auschwitz. It was practically unknown. Uh here the Red Cross played a
very uh un... ..

A:Unhelpful? |

Q:Unhelpful role. They kept some of the reports from as | we know now from Budapest and the
Jewish organizations and didn't ! 11 deliver them to the people who who were uh meant
to receive them. They are direct requests from the Jewish community to give these
reports and we received them a month later when uh nothing could be done anymore.

Q:We need to talk more about the Red Cross and we need to talk more about Hungary, but I
want to stop you right here and ask you something more about Auschwitz, because its its
come up in aontext. Uh there is, of course, uh an argument from some of the scholarly
literature that while the outside world knew generally what was going on in terms of the
extermination camps and so forth, that it did not know about Auschwitz, Birken...not
know specifically about the gas chambers and and crematoria at Birkenau, uh even up
until the middle of 1944. Do you want to to comment on that?

A:Well, that's probably true, that we didn't know. Uh we knew that things were happening in all
kinds of places, but the uh concrete knowledge about the gas ovens, where they were
exactlyw uh came much later, and the the report of the two Slovakian Jews was certainly
a revelation for for all of us. Uh they...there was .. also another report from a Polish
officer which came at the same time. Yeah. And we are certainly also seen, uh but the
the...also the...how the camp was organized, how the...where the gas ovens were placed,
how the...around the the the towers, the watch towers, how this was...this was really the
first time that we heard the I [ [ I; 12 ¢ real inside from this report which came terribly

late, in June | 1944. Uh and even this is very strange why it took so long to to | get out.
Therews a story that it was given to the in | and it never arrived or or took several months
to arrive in [ in Rome, for instance. Now we got this this report uh in two ways in
Geneva. The first uh copy arrived through the Slovak underground at the office of the
Czechoslovakian representative to the League of Nations with whom I very closely
cooperated during the whole war, Dr. . Uh he had...1 think I have mentioned it...he wrote
very closely with one of his uh...with one...with one of our colleagues who was
Czechoslovak, so . Dr. and when the the report arrived, he called and asked him to bring
it to me and to...he asked me to make a condensation of the report, which I did. In four or
five pages~..this report was...I don't know...forty pages or thirty pages, uh and this this
condensed report I gave them not only to him who transmitted it to London, but also to
the British and to the Americans and the conden6ation has been used many...it comes out
in many...in many ways. I saw, for instance, the American ambassador in in London. He
sent it to all kinds of people. It's exactly the same text in which I made. The second copy
came uh...I .. 1 1 would say a few...a few days or a week or ten days later, and arrived and
came from the uh Budapest Palestine office, uh Mr. , and was addressed to the president's
office in in Geneva. It came out through a man who died these days, . Uh he had some
facilities as a secretary of a consulate, and 13 he used uh also Romanian and other
couriers to bring these things out. Uh it was addressed to the uh Palestine of f iCQ but in
reality, and here is a strange thing, Montello opened the the uh the envelope and gave it
to uh in Switzerland who was the exchange telegraph agency or something. Uh the
agency doesn't exist anymore...one of the uh uh telegraphic agencies which existed at the
time. The fact that he gave this to telegraph agency was, of course, completely
unauthorized and really not in order. On the other hand, it was very successful. It uh...for
the first time, the swiss censor authorities didn't stop it, and this was not the merit of
(laughter) of Montello but the fact that...it showed that the war had finally changed and
the success in the war was on the other side, and to our great astonishment, the Swiss let

it go. Uh who has really the merit for this decision, I I don't know. I never found out, but
it was a very important step which was then claimed by Montello as as his great success,
but let me not touch this claim. Uh important was the fact that for the first time a detailed
report on Auschwitz came out, and I would say that before this report, and this is a great
merit for these two Slovakian Jews, uh that for the first time this came in the public. Also
much too late, of course. Much too late. our understanding, of course, was clear. The the
terrible things and the people were killed and so on, but the details in which...how this
was...I would say, but of course, this was many years ago, and maybe some of it I forgot,
but I would say that this was a decisive moment to give us inside knowledge of of how
this thing happened. 14

Q:Well...11, of course, will not quarrel with your judgment of uh decisive moment, but sometime
you and I will talk about some of the earlier documents which came out about
AuschwitzBirkenau. There are earlier reports, not so detailed...

A:No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying that we we didn't know. Of course we knew and we
knew also that there were uh uh hard labor and and and we were in contact, but uh there
were documents, you could really accept as as as...this was really .

Q:Can you give us an approximate date when you received report, when you had to summarize
it? Approximately.

A:No, noF There is...I have established this very clearly, because uh there is a detailed story in
the report about the...a Czechoslovakian group which was in...transferred from
Theresienstadt to Ausford...Auschwitz in quarantine. And this is the first time that we
hesrd quarantine. And for six months in quarantine and afterwards it was liquidated and
in the report also was stated that in a few lines under this what I just mentioned, another

group from Theresienstadt arrived for six months in quarantine. And when L...and this I
discovered when I was writing condensed report, and when I saw this I looked at the
calendar, 15 and saw that there was five days left for the second six months in
quarantine. I stopped working...

Q:When was that? f

A:I this was this was *must have been the 13th of June, I something.

Q:0OK.

A:I believe that received the report on a Saturday or a Friday evening, and we were informed on
a Monday morning, and then I immediately worked on it and fixed the dates. When I saw
this, that there were five days and a group of Czechoslovakian young people, mostly of ,
uh were certain to be exterminated in a in a few days, I stopped my work on the
condensation of the report, called a taxi, jumped in the taxif and went to . And in the taxi
I wrote a story for the BBC. The idea was the BBC should day and night tell the people
that publicly, the public, that we know that such a group will be gassed within five days.
Uh and when I came to , this this uh given the the draft (laughter) which I I wrote on on
my personal note paper, uh uh is still there. We we found it. And uh immediately agreed,
but he really didn't...he didn't send it to London, to his government. He knew that there
was a representative of the BBC in Bern, a Mrs. _ , a very well-known uh | 16 journalist,
and he addressed it to her, and uh as a matter of fact all these papers we we have today.
We have copies and we see it, and , in fact, sent the the the the report to BBC and it was
uh transmitted a number of times. When I told the story once, the one of the
Czechoslovakian inmates of uh uh Auschwitz, uh he said yes, I heard it. I said how dld
you hear this story. He said I was in Auschwitz. I said, you had a radio? He said yes, we

had a radio. This was the father of the historian Kolka (ph), Arthur Kolka. The the old
man, he has a book, and uh he assured me...this is the astonishing thing...he assured me
that this...on the basis of this report from the uh from BBC, they could manage to hide
this this group in other barracks. I said...he said I don't... cannot assure you that they
survived. At that moment, we saved them. Whether they...later I cannot tell you. But it
showed me what extraordinary (laughter) methods you had to uh use in order to save
them. It was a crazy idea that I jumped in and stopped writing of the report and I sent this
report to London. But you had to have and this is my, perhaps one of my greatest
criticism uh with regard to Jewish organization, that they were too much following the
normal routine in their work. You had to have extraordinary ideas, crazy ideas, ideas...T
say it openly, in order to because it was an extraordinary situation. I give you another
example which also uh uh I have sometimes told. In Jerusalem, the head of the
Department of the Jewish Agency was Greenbaum (ph), a very respected man, uh
particularly respected by us in the World Jewish Congress because E 17 of his past as a
Deputy in the Polish . He was really the greater fighter in the inter-war years for Jewish
rights in the Polish . Uh very courageous. Uh he left Poland, I don't know exactly when,
and went to Palestine. He was a Zionist. He was was from the radical party, but a great
fighter for human rights, for for civil rights and so on. Now one day, I get a telegram
from Greenbaum in which he asked me to find his son. I have this completely confused.
A man like Greenbaum asked me to find in Poland, son, and also what's going on. I
couldn't sleep for several nights. I had great respect for the man, and I said well, after all,
the son, the father, son...he looks...I have to do something. But it was crazy. How can I
find a son who's in some camp, if he i8 still alive? Who knows. And I decided to try a
crazy idea. I sent ten little parcels to ten different camps with the name of the son of
Greenbaum, and I found him. Here shows...you really had to go ways and use methods
which were not the normal. So I decided the nine packages will be lost, and somebody
may get them. But I found it. I'm not...I'm just using this opportunity to show that you

had to to use absolutely unusual methods, and it was...now let's go back to the action of
the of the War Refugee Board and what was. .what was...can be put to a certain degree on
on it's credit.

Q:You're talking about Hungary and how you knew very little from March to June 1944, but do
you want to talk a little bit afterwards, what happened...? . » ! 18 0

A:Now, when when this when when this uh news came and I said the second copy of the
Auschwitz report came to the Zionist...to the Palestine office, and there was added
already the statistics of the Jews in the provinces who had been killed, who had been uh
transported to Auschwitz and who were dead. Uh we...from that moment on when this
was clear, and there was really > a very important, concerted political action to save what
could still be saved of the Hungarian Jews, and uh at this...in reality F the only political
action which was undertaken by the Allies in this respect. By the others and not only by
the others . The F first step I think was undertaken by the King of Sweden. The Swedish
section of the World Jewish Congress, had something to do with it. He sent an appeal to ,
the head of the Hungarian state. More important was the action undertaken by the
American government, and that is a unique action really. They uh...the American
government addressed a note to a country with which it was at war. This is unusual. It's
really a break of normal methods, and uh warned them that if they uh...this policy of
extermination would go on, the consequences they would have to bear and there was
attached a special note, appeal by Roosevelt himself, a statement, in this uh request. And
this was officially transmitted by the Swiss as intermediaries...they they were
representing American interests in in Hungary and it was a direct note. This certainly
made a great impact. The fact that the greatest state in the western alliance addressed
such a very strong . 1 19 uh note to the Hungarian government made a great . There was
also an action by the Pope. It's the only time that the Pope addressed a telegram direct

telegram to to and of the Jewish . Uh and finally there's the action in which I was also
involved uh uh by the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, uh in
which was equally addressed personally to to . There is in the literature somebody has
written about it said that the note was transmitted really very late when the action was
practically over. That is not the full story in my opinion because because the the legation,
the Hungarian legation in in uh Bern was fully informed about this, and they they made
this appeal may have reached in direct ways already. All this together had a decisive uh
uh result and and stopped for a certain time the deportations. Then later there was ..for
months we fought against the attempt to to re-introduce the the old policy, and uh this
is...these months are really very confu6ed. There are all the time initiatives to uh continue
the action to send people to Auschwitz, to continue to send them to labor and and put
them into labor battalions and so on, and the , but as we know today, particularly the uh
representative of of the Red Cross in in Budapest, two of the finest representatives, were
very active and counter-acted these things all the time, 50 I cannot say it was a full
success, but I can say there was a real struggle going on, a fight which lasted for months,
and we denounced publicly all the negative uh uh features of this fight. In reality, all
this...and we...very important was in this respect or 20 to the action of the World Council
of Churches which was still in formation, but they had a very uh strong group there, _
and others, and the initiative uh uh was of the World Council with Mark was the
president of the International Red Cross, was really done on my request, and I gave him
all the uh the documentation and the arguments and and uh I've...we did the I used them
too and they were, of course, more successful than we. There status was... a very
religious person and this is today often called the decisive thing which happened there. In
reality this was a cooperative uh effort by them and us and uh very much based on the
documentation which I gave them. Uh but uh...

Q:Let me stop you here because I think the tape is about to run out. OK. We've got two minutes
left. Go ahead. . ".

A:What uh happened finally there there was a very important action on the spot with regard to uh
protection of Jews which the Red Cross and the Swedish and the Swiss and uh other
diplomatic representatives undertook, and all together it saved practically the Jews of .
Those who survived to a great extent owe this to this concerted action and I uh...this is
really the only political effort undertaken during the whole war in which this was tried
out from all uh sides. Everybody knows today Wallenberg and what he did. There are the
same uh uh activity was undertaken by of the Swiss representation, and the Red Cross
gave also protection papers. I remember very well one day Professor who 21 was Vice
President, called me in and asked me uh...we are under terrible pressure we should give
more protection papers, but the more protection papers we give, the less value they have.
What's your opinion? I said give protection papers, Professor , this is not Switzerland.
This is uh uh uh a land where law and order is not reigning yet right here. Give them...a
Jew a chance to survive. How...how...see how the situation is. A man is in the street, and
he will be arrested by uh policemen or soldiers, and then either he has a piece of paper,
protection paper, or he has not, and if he has not, he has no chance. If he has a a...then it
depends on the man with whom he has to deal. Either he is in a good mood or he is ina
bad mood. He slept well with his wife last night, or not. They squabbled or not. It will
depend on the local situation and and the human relationship. Give them a....give them a
chance, and he gaue them the chance and he ordered that many more uh such papers
would...protection

A:Did you read the story of Montello, that he saved a hundred thousand Jews, which is with the
this uh uh nationality or certificates of uh of . I...between ourselves, I have never seen a
man who has uh has been saved through this. I have asked many. I've seen many people
who were saved by Swi8s papers, by Wallenberg's papers, by other, but somewhere...that
story of a F 22 hundred thousand Jews were saved by Montello. YOu know, there are
more people have been saved

Q:...then were killed. Yes. Uh this is not for the tape but I brought you a couple of things on
Birkhart if you... TECHNICAL CONVERSATION END OF TAPE 1

Q:...because they're ready for us. Uh we were talking still about about Hungary and the
cooperation in Hungary for the first time in a political action. Uh
cooperation..(inaudible)...

A:...until the end really it went and there were ups and downs all the time and the uh...you have
probably seen the the record of uh Mr. who writes uh the story on the action of the Red
Cross in in Hungary from day to day, and you see there also that I have been all the time
involved. Practically every action which the Red Cross undertook was finally suggested
by me. I didn't uh cease to to push them and to pressure them. Uh it had finally some
result. Uh of course, there was also...this was not the only thing which I did. I published,
for instance, in on Hungary five pamphlets, uh booklets with great uh documentation
about what was going on, the taking out of Hungarian press and other things. This I
published and sent around, published ; 23 anonymously~ to hundreds of people, press
people, politicians and others. This was all known to the Red Cross too and uh I used it >
for the for the churches. I used it with other people. We WQ we really uh...the the the
report of the two Slovakian Jews. I don't . know whether it's known...I I had them

thousand copies anonymously because I couldn't (laughter) do it officially so it was
illegally, it was was printed and and and distributed in five thousand copies in all over
Switzerland. (clearing throat) Uh this this was very important. I left out some of the
names in order not to make it...but this kind of things I did too and I wasn't only a
diplomat. I was...(laughter) also at different times in our pressure group if you want, uh
but but what I want to say is that the the uh the the Hungarian example which was, of
course, the last year of the war, and we benefitted from the fact that uh generally
speaking people knew that the war was lost for Germany, but that doesn't mean that the
Germans didn't...that their action was not as cruel and as determined as all the others.
They didn't accept that they had lost lost the war. Not at all. I mean what the the action
which the Germans took, Eichmann and the others uh in in Hungary, was one of the most
cruelest and the most determined and the most quickest... quickest action of the of of of
extermination which which happened in the whole thing.

Q:They had the years of experience too. 1 24

A:. Now uh...I spoke about this but then connected with this and we should perhaps speak about
this in in this connection is the uh the action which became also possible thanks to the
support of the War Refugee Board, that is the effort of the attempt to obtain certain...the
liberation of a certain number of Jews by bribing some of the uh responsible people, who
in the year of 1944, of course, were not so cocksure as they were before and they had
their doubts whether the the the war would be won and they had their doubts what would
happen to themselves, and they were afraid what would happen and there were all kinds
of uh attempts to to save their own life, or at least alleviate... alleviate their situation. And
this you see, I have heard, of course, of the various groups which were saved by such
methods. There are the negotiations between Kastner (ph) and uh Baker, Sonny Meyer
involved in a certain way. There's the action uh of and uh the the uh the Nazis to save

twelve hundred Jews from from Theresienstadt. There is the same kind of attempt made
by uh of the World Jewish Congress in Sweden through the...through Himnler and
through the the Dr. Kellsen (ph) who who treated him and finally , head of uh the
Swedish Red Cross. All this uh liberated a few thousand Jews. Every Jew who was
liberated in Sweden was was again...there's no doubt about it, but it was, of course, a very
limited action. Now in the Kastner case, there was the great attempt to use this uh for for
a real big deal of...between the Nazis and the and the Allied uh uh... 25

Q:A million Jews... |

A:A million or ten thousand yeah what was it? I

Q:What was your opinion? Could that conceivably have been done?

A:No. This was... mean for for men...for somehody who followed this from day to day from
outside very closely, I saw that...how even the the small concessions under the
license...the license which I got from the Americans, it was really sabotaged by the
British and it was a license for $25r000~ I mean a ridiculous amount in reality. OK. They
said if this is successful, we will give you more and so I don't uh taking , but when you
saw how risky this these things were uh and there was a determination not to uh let the
other side benefit from anything. Uh this was from ehe beginning for me a dream, that the
the Allies would concede. This was was out of the question. I didn't object to their trying
to negotiate and the whole effort was, in my opinion, rightly in in this effort to to drag on,
to negotiate while Jews were still alive and could be talked about. This is, by the way, the
same what happened in many ways in the ghettos in in in Poland and in in the
Russian...uh some of the heads of the were very intelligent people and they they
understood uh as long as they can put Jews to work, they are not killed. And they tried to

to 26 prolong these periods, and and and to offered Jews for work in order to spare their
lives. This was exactly the same. The the war is going to its end. They saw this. They felt
it. It cannot go...it was four years, four and a half years, and the uh came back and at once
the armies, so every month we can keep people alive was was once again. Thi6 was
absolutely normal and was very intelligent. It was a clear concept which some of the
people in eastern Poland especially had and was was right. The same would be applicable
to the efforts of of of Kastner and Brandt who who negotiated, but but there could come
any decisive result was from my point of view completely uh uh .

Q:What about on the German side? I mean, you've you've implied that the Allies would never
have agreed to supplying trucks and so forth. Do you think the high Nazi officials would
have been willing to...

A:No.

Q:No?

A:No. My my... have said what I think of the Nazi determination to disrupt the the one great
thing which uh on which the regime was really united. There's no doubt about it. The the
extermination of the Jews was one of the central goals of the of the Nazi regime, and that
they would uh...individuals could make 27 concession and so this is another question,
but the decisive, the leadership...no.

Q:You know that there's an argument that that uh going back to the winter of 1942-43, starting in
Slovakia with the with with and Rabbi Weizmann (ph)...

A:Oh yeah. The whole thing is with Weizmann . But this is... Weizmann in uh his memoirs
attacks me that I didn't support this. The the real reason is that I didn't know about it. This
was kept from me. I don't know why. I've never see the Weizmann proposals until '45
when I was in New York and saw it in our uh in the files in New York. In Geneva it was
never shown and his attacks against me is completely without foundation because I
couldn't support anything which which didn't reach me. What I heard about this, ideas
seemed to me wonderful and a man who...

Q:Yes. And Hitler would bargain over the the fate of remaining Jewry in 1943...

A:Well, I said something when I...when I told you why I believed in the fin...the plan for the
final solution, why why I believed this was possible, and here is the American . The
German Jew had seen the the development of the Nazi movement and and knew that they
were...that this was their central object like 28 a part of their face, a center part of their
face, on which they would never give in, and the and at the same time knowing their
determination, their ruthlessness, their complete uh contempt for moral concepts and
accepted what is useful to the German people as they understood and uh and this gives
the answer. Jews in other countries who have been...have had a much more difficult life
and history amongst the citizens of other countries than German Jews probably, uh had
gone through difficult periods but had always found someway to come through, with
terrible losses but somehow they arranged themselves. This was not possible with the
Germans, and this only a German Jew who had learned, who followed the the Nazi
movement from the beginning, could judge. The others had illusion.

Q:We haven't talked yet in detail about the possibility of bombing Auschwitz-Birkenau.

A:Well, let me let me perhaps before we come to this uh~..well we can take this now. I wanted
to to take it in another...in another context but it doesn't matter. Uh this is one of the
strangest things. For me, really I don't understand it~ I personally was involved in this~
I..very much. When the reports from Slovakia came out, of the two Slovakian Jews, and a
few days later it came the reports from the Budapest Palestine office with theifigures. At
the sate time there were already...I think in both reports attached the request to bomb the
communication lines and I 29 Auschwitz. And both were done, was never done, and here
I am before positive which I've never been able to sort...and I come and then speak about
the why so little was done. Maybe there's one aspect in which we should come back on it.
Uh the most important uh intervention in this in this case came from Weizmann, Chaim
Weizmann, the first president of Israel, who was at the time the president of the Zionist
World Organization, who did not interfere in any except in this case. In this case he wrote
a letter to Winston Churchill. How important he must have felt about it. Uh he he kept
completely to his line. He is not there for general Jewish uh interventions, affairs and so
on. He is there to first the Zionist idea and so on. But here he made an exception. And he
was successful in this exception. Weiman has has put this in a very good article which
was published in commentary in which I have been consulted several times before he
would, and it is absolutely clear that here something happened which is .
The...Weizmann's intervention was not the only one. Wetll come back on this, but
Churchill's impressed by Weizmann's letter and writes, let's try it. And Eden who was
less than perceptive I believe toward our case, uh is impressed by Churchill's signature
and adds his name, OX...let's try it. And then it goes to Sinclair (ph), up to to the the
Minister of Air, who is a liberal, not a bad man, and from there it goes to the Chief of
Staff, and from there it goes back to the Foreign... Foreign Office. And nothing is
happening. And to us, and to me, to Goldman, so the deputy head of the extraditionary
corps, the 30 the deputy of Eisenhower...I I don't remember the name...in America...

Q:McCoy you mean.

A:Huh?

Q:John McCoy.

A:No. It was not John McCoy. It was a general, a general. Uh I forgot the name. He he must...he
mentioned it a number of times. I went to the British and the American Embassy. To the
American Embassy, I gave them maps which I found in the in the League of Nations on
the Upper Salasia in the twenties, early twenties. I said this was a popular boat, and
there's . .. probably no better maps on this region than this, and I got with the help of the
librarian of the League of Nations, I got copies of all these maps. I said this is the best
you need, and I gave it to to the . This wasn't too easy to get such a thing. And they tell
me it's not possible and they tell me it's too far and we cannot get back and they uh...it's
too risky and we know today because not only they had the...in the year 1944, the Allies
had the absolute air domination over the whole of Europe. Secondly, it's not true that they
had no bombers that could fly. At the same time when we asked...by the way, this came
up already earlier in in '43 or '4 that...not four, '43...someone...the ideal 31 came out _ ,
but it was...we made a concentrated effort in June '44. Uh at the same time when we
asked, there were five bombardments of the camp of _ , five kilometers from Auschwitz.
So why do they lie? Unbelievable...we cannot reach it and then they bomb at the same
time. We know today that the air uh uh the photographs of the...

Q:Photo reconnaissance?

A:Yeah. There is in in London an office which has all these photos, detailed photos from the
whole region, much better, of course, than what I could produce from the League of

Nations. But why did...but they lied to us. They said some people...I called _ . He was
then the the General Secretary of the Congress in New York, and he had an idea not to
bomb it but to send in commandos there and to makes an explosion from inside in order
to reduce the number of victims, and then some historians said that was against bombing.
(laughter) It was a more refined way of of reaching the same thing. But here this really
leaves me without answer. And it particularly it shows the enormous role which
bureaucracy has played. We have always discussed the Holocaust connection with Nazi
bureaucracy. Uh we've seen how important the Nazi bureaucracy was in this, but here
you see it suddenly that there's another bureaucracy which has played a very important
role, a negative role, if men like like like like uh Churchill and Eden can give such
instructions and nothing happened...because the 1 32 bureaucracy doesn't like it. This is a
very serious uh aspect of the whole thing, and uh...

Q:Was bureaucracy then one of the basic reasons why the Allies did so little in response to
opportunities between...

A:Let's let's do this in a more systematic way. But thi6 is one of the factors which have certainly
played a role. No doubt about it. Now we have said uh we have made a survey of what
became possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board, but we have left out
one, in my opinion, very important aspect, and that is the preservation of the camp
inmates at the end of the war. I must tell you that from I would say probably October
nineteen hundred forty-four on, I was...I had an obsession, a real obsession. I was dread
the fearing that at the end...it was clear that the war was over. It was clear it dragged on,
the war dragged on but the the Germans had lost it, but the Germans who used children in
the war effort and this was and I personally...maybe it's my education...1 was afraid that
the last effort in a kind of in Waggoner's context it's ...uh when everything is lost, they
would at least see to it that the the rest of the Jews who were still alive, they would take

them with them. And I was absolutely obsessed by the idea that in the last moments they
will make a slaughter of the three or four hundred thousand Jews in the camps which
were . And I couldn't sleep and I told myself, what can we do in order to stop this And I
had at a .1 133 certain moment the idea, alright let's make a great effort, a joint effort of
everybody together, because everybody is in the same boat. The French had their inmates
in the camps, and the Czechs and the Poles and so on and so on, and I took the initiative
to mobilize all the Allied forces in Geneva in order to organize a joint action to prevent
this~ It wasn't too easy. I was stateless too, without government. There was no Israeli
government. There was no Jewish government. There was no supported, and I took the
initiative and L...the first question is who is neutral enough or in good relations with
everybody that he could uh play this role, and I decided on the Czechoslovakian
government, and I approached the delegate from Czechoslovakia at the League of
Nations, and invite everybody, the French and the Belgians and the Dutch and the
Yugoslav, and the Italian was in the meantime...and the Romanians were also and the
Greek, and he did. And we had our first meeting I think was in November '44. I was in uh
in 8ern that day and came a little late to the to the meeting, and I was very pleased to see
all the representatives either of real government representatives or the representatives of
the Red Cross Society offices, countries...they were all officials practically. It was the
same. And uh and when J arrivedt he said the idea comes from Dr. Riegner. Let him
explain to you what what he wants. And I uh explained to them that we we were all in the
same boat and there was a great danger that this would happen, that at the last moments
they would really suppress all the people in the camps and they were capable of doing it,
and 34 we should do a last desperate effort to save this and to prevent this. And we
discussed various ways, uh neutral countries or Red Cross and so on, and the idea...and
there was very considerable support, but of course they couldn't decide. They had to ask
their government, and uh we had several sessions. The last session was in in...the decisive
session was in I think February. It went already in the next year because the governments

are very slow in replying, and there we all agreed we should ask the International Red
Cross for a very special, high-level mission to the political authorities of of of Germany
to prevent it. And it was agreed and then these governments, they didn't have all relations
between themselves and some didn 't recognize them, but they were all in agreement it
should be done, and the idea was therefore not to to sign a joint paper but to...that
everybody should submit this identical appeal to the President of the Red Cross uh for
this purpose. And I wrote the text, and uh everybody signed it, and at a certain day
between ten and eleven, they all submitted the the signed appeal to the Red Cross, and
this led to the last great action of in Germany where he saw Carlton Brunner who was
really the number two under under Himnler. Now when called together all these people
and then when he came back, he called them again together, and I questioned him very,
very thoroughly and this is also...I didn't just take his (laughter) assurances for granted. It
opened up a certain number of activities for the Red Cross but I think much more
important, it gave to the German government as a clear understanding that the whole
Allied, all the 35 Allied governments together were determined not to let this happen.
And it has...while events precipitated and military and others developed so quickly that
all the _ were uh by-passed by new events all the time, so that uh the agreements, the real
agreements which were concluded between and the the German Nazis, the moment they
were done really already by-passed and the and it's not so important whether they were
implemented or not. The the...it it created a decisive fact, political fact, that the the
governments did not allow this to happen, and with few exceptions, it didn't happen.
There are a few camps where they tried to kill people, and they killed some of them, but
relatively limited. The action was, on the other hand, supported by the activities of who
acted in the same line with the on behalf of the Swedish _ and I was in contact, telephone
and otherwise, with _ in in in Sweden and we tried at least to to coordinate and inform
each other what was going on. I believe that strangely the uh people have dealt with the
Holocaust and the...and so the people who got saved and were spared, nobody really

mentions this. I think it's one...I think this is...the War Refugee Board was supporting us
very much on this. No doubt about it. The American government asked us to keep them
informed and at later meetings, they were present. At the first meetings they were, I
believe, not there. In the later meetings, the British government also was present. I mean,
this was really...France and...was was a united front of the whole uh coalition of the Nazi
question. And uh I can only say the the the result was that the life of most of the people
36 0 was respected, which I consider was not a matter which was going without . It was,
by the way, not the only activity which this group undertook. We alao addressed
ourselves in the last days of the war to the Allies, and that they should allow uh columns
of trucks with food and other medical and so to go into the camps and to see. They should
be not kept out because of military or bureaucratic reasons. And we had...the the same
group intervened with the Allied governments on on on these matters and probably the
results were quite positive, the reaction on this. Now I believe uh that uh Winston's man
like Weinman says that the War Refugee Board saved two hundred thousand people or
something such a figure, I I believe this is very questionable. All these figures are very
questionable. Uh what _ makes the real uh calculations. I believe that the saving of the
people, the inmates of the camps in the last moment is is is one of the most things which
we reached, saying this was also a collective effort but I I don't think I exaggerate
because I was involved in this. I believe really this is...made quite a difference. Now let
me say something about why so little was done and why...what shall I say...why so little
was done and why we have this...

Q:...between November '42 and January of '44.

A:Yeah. Well, we didn't save...the the War Refugee Board took eighteen months until the first
and the only real action was undertaken and how many millions of people were uh were
killed in . 137 the meantime. Now I, of course, have given more thought than most

people uh because I was so deeply involved and I tried so hard and why did all this not
lead to greater action. There is a whole series of factors. And I'll may mention them, but
I'll come to the end to the most important uh reasons. Firstly, nobody was really prepared
for such a thing. And this shows really the uniqueness of the Holocaust. That's for sure.
This had never happened in history, that a whole people including the babies and old
people and and invalids and men and women, children, that a whole people was
condemned to be executed. It hasn't happened. And with all the catastrophes which have
come over Jews during the course of history ...in the course of history, nobody really
mentions such a thing. I mean they're just not prepared for this. This is the first time. The
second is uh the atrocity...atrocity stories of the 1st World War...(break in tape) ...this
came up all the time. During the 1st World War especially during the occupation by the
Germans of Belgium, there came all kinds of stories what the Germans did and after the
war it occurred that this was highly exaggerated and a good number of these stories were
not true. Whenever I came as my reports and so on, I was going against this war. they
called at that time, and this was a very great handicap for . I am not trying to underrating
it. Number three, the secrecy. In spite of everything, this was a so- called secret
undertaking. Uh has rightly said that many many people were involved but officially this
was a secret uh operation, and not only was it a secret operation, this was an 38 operation
for which a special language was invented which said complete different things which
they meant. Where the uh ...all this meant meant uh a lot of other words and we are...was
invented in order to make it clear that it shouldn't have been clear. The the most
interesting in this is the the famous speech by Himnler to the...in '43 to the heads of the
SS or...where he said more or less he will never admit it and he action was a great
national act of self-defense, but in which he said we will not leave any traces of it. I will
never admit it.

Q:And yet it was being recorded as he was speaking?

A:Yeah. Now I have another letter such in my files by Himnler to Miller who was also one of the
top people in the in the Third Reich security . Section 4. And this is interesting. .. Uh it's
a very strange...a letter in which he refers to a report by Stephen Wise. You know this
perhaps...

Q:Yeah.

A:...of September nineteen hundred forty-two, in which Stephen Wise must have referred about
my famous telegram and the report. We have never found really to what statement of
Wise it refers. This is something for the for the scholars to to work on. And there's
exactly...and he he he uh he speaks there as if uh of course the the the course of
transporting so many people, of 39 course, many people die and so on. This is normal.
And again, don't leave any trace also of the dead. It's clear and absolute deliberate effort
to to hide the real facts and to eradicate any any traces which could be...it's a strange
concept. If they are so proud, why...of their action, why why this secrecy.

Q:I wrote in my book on Himmler that Himmler was torn by this conflict between the need to
conceal, on the one hand, and the need to keep orderly records on the other.

A:Yeah. Now then the next point is we have already talked about it a little bit but I think we
should uh talk more about it...the anti-Semitism is the Allied camp. Now this is
something uh perhaps at this moment where anti-Semitism is growing again in many
places in the world and even in this country, but the generation the last thirty years, the
American Jewish youngsters didn't suffer from anti-Semitism, and they don't...didn't
understand that there was a very active anti-Semitic movement in this country in the '30's.
Uh those who were feeling this movement were of course the Nazis to a great extent, but

you had also your your own people. The Nazis with the and their own organization of the
which were were appointed in all the countries to uh develop anti- or Nazi activities and
anti-Jewish activities all over. Uh but you had your own people. Uh there were the the
Father Coffmann who who was twice a week I think on the on the on the radio. The
television didn't exist at the time. There was K. 40 D. Smith, another such uh public
anti-Semite who who influenced it. It was a...and there was the German propagandist was
extremely ably led and they the German propaganda accused Jews of America...they
pushed Roosevelt into the war. This was...uh first of all, it wasn't true, but uh the Jews...it
it prevented really Jewish activities for two years in the war. You don't find any traces of
anti-Jewish uh persecutions in the in the newspapers from nineteen hundred forty until
nineteen hundred forty-two. Uh the going to war was not popular in this country.
Generally speaking uh this was one of the greatest problems for Roosevelt. He he wanted
to to stop the the Nazi Germany. There's no doubt about it. His whole policy was...but he
couldn't do it because he...the feeling that America shouldn't be involved and the
isolationism of America was was enormously strong. And to to to accuse the the the
Jews...they pushing into the war, they are the the the war mongers. They are the the
responsible for...it it...this was a terrible (inaudible)... and in fact it had its effect on the
Jewish community. It restricted them. They were much...they were really afraid of this uh
accusation and and and and therefore terribly restricted and restrained. So...and it was
highly efficient uh action...way of of uh... uh uh extremely uh successful propaganda in
favor of the Germans and the Nazis. Now uh...but we had it even in the government. We
spoke about it. In fact the whole story of how my telegram at first was received, how
instructions were given not to accept any more messages from private persons or private
organizations. The the uh sabotage of I « 41 [the the rescue effort, the rescue uh plans
after the April '43 telegram, uh these all...the whole question of visas. I know that our
greatest problem as German Jews was the American visas, and there was a limited

number. I think twenty-four thousand or something for German...people of German...and
we found out at the end of the war they were never filled. Why?

Q:You see this as more the result of anti-Semitism than the result of bureaucracy or a
combination of the two?

A:I think both. But here I think the...I think the man who is responsible to a great extent is is as I
said Breckenridge , and he uh in my opinion, pursued the policy to keep Jews out of
America.

Q:And there were a whole bunch of State Department people who...

A:There were others too. There were others too. There were others too, and uh I don't know
whether Roosevelt was aware of it or not. In any case the lady who comes out very well
is Mrs. Roosevelt who tried very hard but didn't succeed either. She she came in several
times with schemes for Jewish children and so on that...but when you turn to...from from
America to Britain, you have the same. There it has an anti-zionist flavor, that the whole
time uh uh is valid both for the Foreign Office and the 42 Colonial Office, and you have
a very good study by about this and it's pages and pages where you where you see what
the bureaucracy did in order not to be helpful. There's uh...sometimes ...we haven't
spoken about these little boats which were sent to Palestine from Bulgaria and and
Romania with a few hundred Jews, and when you read the reports of the Foreign and
Colonial Office people, you ask yourself, now who is the enemy. Is it the Jews or the
Germans? And you definitely feel that it is the Jews. It's unbelievable I mean even when
you read it today, but it takes takes the establishment of the War Refugee Board, the
reports and the and the British Foreign Office uh...they don't say anything else that the

the establishment of the War Refugee Board is uh uh a method by Roosevelt to gain the
Jewish votes in the election.

Q:And they were .

A.....that there could be a humanitarian idea behind it that you wanted to to help people who are
gravely in danger. Nothing. I mean it's unbelievable when when you read it, and these are
the people who who were on your on your side. They ran it. He was...there's no doubt
that this played a great role in your , the bureaucracy and the anti-Semitism, the
anti-Semitic bureaucracy was able to prevent. Now uh...but in in in...connected with this
there is a...the insensitivity of high...of people in high position, and I am particularly
mentioning the military. What what we have said about the effort to bomb Auschwitz, not
to bomb 7.,~ [ 43 / AuschwitZ how this is possible. I said why did one write it. To all our
uh arguments and how often did I argue, they...we always got uh they have to win the
war. I said yes, but you will...you want to win the war in order to save the people who are
threatened. Yeah, this is uh...we cannot make any any exceptions. Now they tell me in in
in in Auschwitz when they bombed the , they couldn't have two or three uh bombs left for
the for the gas uh chambers. Wasn't so easy for us to take the decision, but the...all fact
responsible are this bombing would kill another number of Jews. Of course. But you
would have stopped the extermination process. Every day six thousand people killed. So
of course we had to say better to stop the the the the extermination process and even if it
costs some lives, but where is this ....how is it possible that all the high military people,
that nobody even made some kind of an effort to understand this and to help. It didn't cost

A:No. I think...I don't think it is...no, I don't think it was anti-Semitism. It was insensitivity, and
and concrete...you are a soldier. You have to do your job and so on. But as I told you, you
can also have feelings. And if it doesn't harm your job, why why why can~t you do
something. Explain to me that uh we know I 44 today that big boats came with soldiers
over the ocean, with tens of thousands of soldiers, and they went back empty, and when
we were asking for visas and for transport, they said there's no transport. They couldn't
fill these boats. Why did they lie? come back to this. Why did they lie? There's no
place...there were enormous space. This was empty. . But here is something wrong and
insensitivity. I don't think they they ever thought of it, and this is the wrong thing. The
soldiers and and the high officials in government, also , and there something was wrong.
Question We'll stop here for a minute because the tape is just about to run out, and then
we'll continue. TECHNICAL CONVERSATION END OF TAPE 2

A:All what I have said is...has influenced the situation. But I believe there are two points which
are really decisive. The first is the complete powerlessness of the Jewish people at that
time of history. It's very difficult for the generation of today to understand it. we have
today a rather influential Jewish community in the United States. We have today a Jewish
state which is uh has been very successful in the last forty years with militarily,
politically, which has had great influence on many understand this, and not to compare
the situation of today with the situation forty or fifty years ago. That has to be learned and
that's one of the most important problems in Jewish education you have to understand.
Today we are a different Jewish people. We have learned from the Holocaust. We have
learned from our isolationism. We have learned that we can and decisive moments only
count on . You cannot apply the ways or or position of organizing uh protests of 1990 and
1940. The great number of these methods were not available. There were certainly not
available during the war. The police would have chased the protesters away from the
White House or wherever uh in a in a minute, and the real thing is that we had no

influence at the time. This is . And the second uh third truth is that what happened was so
terrible and so beyond any human understanding that people really couldn't believe it.
And I'm saying this meaning both Jews and non-Jews. And concurs in one of his books in
a very able way exemplified this point. To exterminate a whole people including babies
and sick people and...is something, and and and to throw babies into gas ovens, burning
the human beings alive and then...is something which we...goes beyond any human
understanding and . And therefore, we have to distinguish between knowing the facts and
accepting facts. After the declaration of the Allied governments in December of '42,
everybody knew. And we thought now something will happen, decisively will happen.
But in reality, the people who had under...had signed this declaration had great doubts
whether this was really happening. And Jews themselves...I would ! : 47 say that many
people who knew, who learned, who spoke about it, had in their inner hearts somewhere
a reflection...I hope this is all not true. You cannot...this cannot be true. I give you a few
examples. In nineteen hundred forty-three, I got one day from the Union of Polish 3ews
in America, a package with thirty thousand addresses in Poland to whom I was supposed
to send packages. When I received this package, I got nearly crazy. This organization had
its seat in the same building and I believe even on the same floor as the American and
World Jewish Congress to whom to whom all my reports went. They must have read all
my reports. I asked myself, they have still not understood it. But it wasn't this. They had
read it and they had understood it, but they couldn't accept that their own families were
included in the . It cannot be. None of these thirty thousand addresses were valid
anymore. They people had been evacuated or had been killed already or had been in the
in the camps. Not one was . But you couldn't sit 0 and do nothing. You have to do
something. And you're excluded you own family. Alright. I know that many many people
are sacrificed and killed, but not my family. This cannot be true. And so they collected
that something has to be done, so they collected the addresses, and . They never got . I
couldn't do anything but here you have the schizophrenic reaction. Knowing, but

not...somehow not believing or taking exceptions for yourself. The story of is well
known. It has been often repeated. When when when he went to Frankfurt and and and
and and uh I can't believe it, and then he said, you mean I ama, 48 liar. He said no, I
didn't say that you are a liar. But I said I can't believe it. But this is one of the most
respected Jews in this country. When wise got my first uh report, he sits down and the
next day or two days later and writes to Frankfurt and tells him and and really shares with
him his terribly despair. What can one do, but tell the the . He Frankfurt he probably did.
I'm sure he did. Uh there's another story of uh which was given by Professor deYoung,
who is one of the authors of the classic work on the uh deportations from Holland, and he
was a young man and and and the government of exile in Holland during World war I,
and was in charge of radio emissions, and he gets hold of some of my reports, and he
reports in a lecture he gave in Washington...no, in Harvard, some time ago, and uh tells
the story how he gave these reports to the Prime Minister of Holland, . tells...uh returns
these reports a few days later to him and says, you believe in this stuff? But worse even,
who I made mentioned before who was Secretary General of the World Jewish congress
during that last period of the War, uh there was in 1944 in November a great conference
called by the World Jewish Congress in Atlantic City which really sets out a post-War
program of the Jewish people. It's a very important document. Uh it's really...it was the
next twenty years what Jewish...the Jewish community in in the world has pursued as
goals and so on is defined there. Astonishing how how good the document is, a very
important contribution to Jewish planning and Jewish policies in the post-War. And goes
to a number of ministers . .' 49 with the delegation of the assembly in Atlantic City and
he meets amongst other people uh the uh Vice Minister of the Defense, McLoy. You
mentioned him before, and they submit the official documents and tell him to speak about
it and so on, and McLoy, a very respected man in the government of this country and
who played a very important role after the War as a high commissioner in Germany and
so on, a lot of other important functions, asked _ to remain behind when the uh delegation

retired. And he says and there's a report by and it's been published...I don't remember
where but I've read it and he said...so McLoy says to him, while now as we are alone you
can admit this is all propaganda. This is December nineteen hundred forty-four, five
months before the War was over and the number two man in the government on on the
war effort doesn't believe it. Now this shows uh there was really the people didn't believe.
This shows that it was so beyond any human (inaudible tape) human conditions, that you
couldn't believe it. this was of course one of the most negative things and it cost us
millions of lives. Now I'm not taking away the terrible consequences, that on the other
end it's uh perhaps the most hopeful thing in the whole history of the of the Holocaust... ..

Q:In retrospect.

A:In retrospect. It means that man cannot live with absolute evil. You cannot accept absolute
evil. There is some way E 50 the conviction that man is good, man is pure. Man is not
condemned to the worst, and this...it's a paradox. When...many Jews do not like when I
say this, because they cannot forget...I cannot forget either this , but the fact that man
cannot accept this, and man could not accept it, gives you hope in the man of tomorrow.
It is really the most positive conclusion you can have. In this world of darkness, you
cannot despair of men.

Q:Let me ask you something about something that was not specifically on your list of things that
uh or explanation provided for so little done. Uh you mentioned the insensitivity of high
officials, but you didn't talk specifically about President Roosevelt. You probably know
that uh some of the books on the subject, particularly David Weiman's book uh Single
Out Roosevelt is is a major factor, perhaps the major factor. Tell us a little bit about your
assessment of Roosevelt.

A:Well, it's of course very difficult for my generation to to make a final judgment on this. We
work...we uh uh were educated in uh in a world and this was where it was the only hope,
and later judge. Uh and of course the study of uh the war record of the American
government shows that uh all kinds of opportunities were lost and were not used, and the
political responsibility is certainly borne by Roosevelt to a great extent. But on the other
hand, he is the only one who can say...uh could say that this policy has also prevailed, to
preserve some Jews. I spoke of lend I ; 51 lease. Lend-lease has saved probably Britain
and probably more than Britain. I think that this _ thanks to lend and lease and the...of
course the resistance of the British people that they survived, and with this survival, four
hundred thousand Jews in Britain have been saved from the invasion of of the Nazis and
would have been victims. But another conservation is even more important. If Britain
would have gone under, Palestine would have gone under. It was very near that the Nazis
came into Egypt and Palestine. There are six hundred thousand Jews and much more. Can
you imagine that the Nazis would have wiped out the Jews in Egypt and in Palestine in
1942 or '3 or '4. Our whole world...our whole Jewish world wouldn't exist. With the
center of Israel today is a powerful factor for every aspect of Jewish life. That's also due
to the Allied effort and Roosevelt had an important stake in it. That doesn't mean that I'm
not...I'm defending and the inactivity. I think he bears a great responsibility but he and
Churchill are the only ones who on the other hand have also contributed to the
preservation of the free world, and that cannot be completely forgotten either.

Q:A couple of times we've mentioned in passing the role of the uh the Vatican and the
International Red Cross. Uh it seems to be in this section about why was so little done, uh
we need to come back to them and talk a bit more about . Perhaps what they did, but also
what they could have done and did not do. 152

Q: Well, on the vatican I have once given a great lecture on the vatican and on the World
Council of Churches. Uh they have...there has been very little done. Uh I spoke, I believe,
of the memorandum which we gave to the in Bern in nineteen hundred forty-two, and the
only result of this was uh that some action was taken with regard to Slovakia and the
deportations of Slovakia were interrupted, stopped for a certain time. This was a Catholic
priest who was at the head of the government. Uh in all the...I have spoken on the action
taken in in Hungary by the Vatican and here I believe that the vatican and the the Nuncio
who was in Budapest has tried to and cooperated with the general effort to preserve the
Jewish community, and even the local bishops and uh were influenced in this way. But
generally speaking, the situation depended on this the personal courage and the personal
determination of the leaders in the various countries. And you have examples of courage
and determination and you have examples of complete uh laissez-faire. Some of the
bishops and archbishops...you have beautiful examples in France like Cardinal of
Toulousse, who went to the station where the deportations from where the deportations
took place, and his presence was an act of protest. There were some other
bishops...Bishop , Bishop .. , but there were also other cardinals who supported the
vichary regime fully, and the Vatican never interfered even in the French anti-Jewish
legislation when it was asked whether..of his opinion. the Vatican in my opinion, and
there there are twelve or thirteen volumes of vatican documents what uh what they were
doing 1 53 during the War, I believe that the real problem in the catastrophe of the...which
happened to us was never taken seriously by the Vatican until the War was practically
over, and I believe that there was no real realization in the highest uh levels of the
Vatican bureaucracy, uh no real evaluation of the out...of of the the the dimensions of the
catastrophe, and I believe that the Vatican was better informed maybe than we believe.
There are hundreds and hundreds of priests. and we were not prevented from and there
are books who report on this, on these reports. In the official documentation, it shows that
some uh priests reported very clearly about the about the elimination of the Jews and the

kulling of Jews. When prohibited Wise to publish my famous it was agreed that they
should ask opinion of the Vatican and the opinion of the Vatican was very wishywashy.
They said we have also reports but uh it doesn't...on on that treatment, but they didn't
confirm the elimination. Astonishingly, because , the who reports regularly to the Vatican
and who writes about the same time the new things are the bombardments of the state, of
the cities, and the uh increased elimination and extermination of the Jews and there are
already more than two million exterminations. So one cannot tell me they didn't know.
Uh in some places, the local bishops helped. The action of the vatican centrally was
practically limited to Hungary. There they tried a certain influence, but otherwise I
wouLd say there was no real great concern. And uh I often uh thought that my long
conversation with uh with Monseigneur Montini 54 in 1945 when the war was over and I
was asked to plead with him the Catholic authorities should help us to recuperate the
Jewish children who had been hidden by Catholic authorities or Catholic individuals and
when I argued with him...this was November 1945...and said that we had...we were very
grateful to the Catholic Church for what it had done in order to save some Jews, Jewish
children especially, but we had lost in the war one and a half million Jewish children, and
we couldn't loose one more child. He questioned me, he questioned this statement and
was absolutely astonished when I gave him the statistical background to my _ . For
twenty minutes we argued. I told him, you know, there were in Poland...the
birthrate...was a birthrate...a Jewish birthrate of sixty thousand every year. Multiply by
16, 16...you can...you arrive at 960,000 children, up to the age of sixteen. We should have
in 1945 at the end of the War, found 960,000 Jewish children in Poland. Do you know
how many we found? Something like 3,640 kids. There is a report by uh Jewish leader,
Louis Seeger who comes back from Poland and brings these figures. take Hungary.
Hungary with Transylvania, territories which belonged...we call to Romania, about eight
hundred thousand Jews. There were about four hundred thousand in the Hungarian
provinces. On an average, there should have been a hundred thousand Jewish children.

Maybe a little less...eighty thousand. When the war was over, how many Jewish children
did we find? Eight children. He was shaken when I told him and I continued. I was well
prepared to go on. He said they they they left. There was immigration. 55 | I said where
was immigration. Perhaps a few hundred, for there I were still was to the mountains of
Romania, but it's terribly difficult. Not thousands...for twenty minutes we argued. It was
one of my most unsuccessful diplomatic _ in my whole career. I shook him, there's no
doubt. He...for the first time he realized that six million Jewish dead meant a million and
a half Jewish children, but if the number two or three in the uh...

Q:Hierarchy...

A:Hierarchy...the the Catholic hierarchy, had to learn from me to realize in November when it
was 1945, what this meant, this shows that uh not very high priority was given to these
problems in the Vatican, and uh the other example is I mentioned already several times.
He went to the Vatican in August nineteen hundred forty-two...uh '45, supported by some
very important Catholic uh scholars, including Jack who became later the cardinal,
became the French Ambassador to the Holy See, a very important, very distinguished
Catholic scholar, including uh the uh priest in in in uh who became a cardinal later whose
name escapes me at the moment, who has written a very important book also in
Catholic-Jewish relations, including uh a prelate of Egyptian-Jewish origin. A whole
series of very uh distinguished Catholic theologians and they argued that this was a time
for the Holy See to issue a Jewish on the relations with the Jews. There was no reply, and
it took twenty years until vatican Council 56 II that the church really found that it had to
issue a statement on the future of Christian-Jewish relations, a very important statement .
It's a beginning of a new approach to the Jews, but you see here the.. all these indications
show that certainly the Jewish catastrophe was not seized in all its terrible dimensions
and it had certainly not priority in the considerations of the vatican at the time.

Q:What about the role of the International Red Cross?

A:The International Red Cross, you have today a very important study by Professor , uh the
Geneva historian who has...is the only one who had access to all the files, and the result
of this study is not very positive to say the least. There are two positive things which I
have to say sbout the Red Cross. The one is the fact that uh , Vice President, concerned to
us in 1942 that he had also news about uh the final solution and that he had heard from
several German diplomatic witnesses that the final solution was in in execution. This was
a positive, a very positive fact for us to determine and to inform the Allies that this was a
reality. The second is the negotiations which I mentioned before with and certainly
contributed to to help prevent the extermination of the people who were still in the camps
at the end of the war, but apart from this, the attitude of the Red cross was uh not very
helpful, and not very uh courageous. There was a moment when some of the members of
the Red Cross really 57 felt they had to make an open protest against amongst other
things the treatment of the Jews. Uh or at least an appeal in which these matters would be
open...openly denounced but uh it never came to this appeal or public protest.
It's...although I must admit there was a majority of the members of the International
Committee who were in favor of such . But here the Swiss government intervened and
prevented any such declaration. Uh I've been often asked whether this should have
happened or not. In my opinion, there are moments for international organizations,
welfare organizations, where you have to speak out, and I was asked by the Red Cross at
the time...I clearly recommended and pushed and was very active in order to that such a
statement of denunciation should happen, but it didn't happen and was prevented, as I
said, by the swiss government which was afraid of the Germans. Uh but nevertheless, at
certain moment our insistence of decisive action had some result. There was in 1942, in
September '42, and the dates are very important because this is the moment where we

informed uh _ that we knew about the final solution and he confirmed to us that he knew
too. Uh there the Red Cross sent a memorandum to their delegation in Germany in which
uh they left it to the decision of the delegation if they should uh submit to the German
authorities uh a request for the extension of the basic rules of Red cross protection to the
intern...interned people in the various camps and not in the camps of prisoners of war and
the other camps. Uh this activity, this action had no consequences. That was the most
serious. They kept me in the belief for two I 58 years that they were pushing on this
constantly and there were always new interventions in this sense. This is just not true. 's
book makes it very clear that until the uh situation developed in Hungary in 1945 which
we have described, practically nothing has has happened, and this is in my opinion a very
serious mistake and uh very serious failure of the Red Cross. Moreover, the book of _
brings out a number of very unpleasant facts. For instance, the Red Cross accepted
without protest a request of the German Red Cross that...I think it's 1941...it could be
'42...that in the future inquiries about people who are lost...who are searched for, should
in the future be submitted separately for aliens and non-aliens. That they accepted this
distinction is certainly a scandal and certainly not in the line of uh Red Cross principles,
and there are a number of other such incidents which are certainly not very good and
show also the the very limited courage which the Red Cross had in countering the
Germans. There's a historian who has...a Swiss historian, Mr. Paul Stouffer, who has
denounced this attitude in an article concerning the case of . The twelve thousand Polish
officers were murdered by the...by Russians. At the time, the uh German government and
the Polish government in exile both asked the International Red Cross to establish an
inquiry commission in order to determine who was responsible for this act. Uh behind all
this was the government...was the propaganda ministry and uh the Red Cross could not
accept the proposal because the third party hadn't and the third party were the Russians,
and according to the principles of ! 59 the Red Cross only when all involved could
agree...could such a question could such an inquiry commission be established, but Mr.

Stouffer refers in this respect to the diaries of . Uh of course, the Germans were very
upset that this inquiry commission didn't happen. Uh but in the diaries of uh he defends
himself and says we couldn't make a big fuss about this case. We are much too much
depending on the International Red Cross concerning our own interests with regard to
prisoners of war and other other interned people in Allied countries and so on, which
shows exactly that the Red Cross disposed of higher prestige and status in Germany when
they believed themselves and all their hesitations not to insist too much with the Germans
because of the overwhelming power of the Germans, uh it..at the time is here really
contradicted by one of the greatest witnesses one could produce in which it said we
depend on the good will of the Red Cross. This has never been taken serious and never
been realized but by the responsible people in in Geneva. So the Red Cross today doesn't
anymore really defend this position. For the first time under the new president there, , I
saw recently articles in which they said yes, we didn't do enough at the time, but now we
have another policy and so on so. And this is in a not the attitude uh of the deal on these
matters much more in detail in my own autobiography. I was very much involved in the
whole theater of Red Cross activities, and the book by you see day by day for how I
pressured the Red Cross into action in the Hungarian uh case and uh also in 's book, there
are I think 45 references I 60 to my activities uh but it was certainly a very important
activity also from our side and some of it produced results but, of course, much too
limited.

Q:We have a little less than ten minutes to go. I was going to ask you about uh relations with the
Jewish agency and the Joint, but if you have something that you would rather say that has
not come out yet, please feel free to take this time.

A:No, we can speak about the the the nations that say they cooperation of the Jewish
organizations in Geneva. I'm not speaking now on the on the world. Uh there have been

very little described really. We were not very good. With the agency I had very good
relations with the head of the agency in Geneva, , who was an old diplomat of the Zionist
movement. He was even more pessimistic than I was, and so pessimistic that he really
gave up doing things. He has written enormous amount of letters in describing his
despair, which is...I didn't do this. I uh was afraid partly of the censorship. Everything
which we wrote went through censorship and I didn't want the , but uh there
was...cooperation was alright. There were all kinds of uh little offices between which
there was a good deal of jealousy, but while I was at the time upset by some of these
personal problems, when you see it as a whole and it didn't make any difference on the
whole scene. Uh the the Germans were so uh powerful whether we would have _ a little
better together or not, wouldn't have made 61 any difference. The Joint is another
chapter. The Joint gave instructions not to cooperate with . Had instructions from the
Joint in in , New York, not to cooperate with us which was due to the uh competition
between the World Jewish Congress in the United States which pursued rescue activities
on its own and based on the collections in South America and the Joint. My criticism
with regard to the Joint is very clear. Until very late they did not see that this was not just
a general welfare undertaking which was necessary but a special political rescue action.
This they understood very ...and rescue and philotropic (ph) welfare is quite a different
thing. The Joint even opposed Martin Goldman's proposal to the...Goldman was a man
who had great ideas and great schemes. He had..in the war, during the war, two great
ideas. The one was to approach the Allies and to take...to ask them to ask them that the
Allies should offer to the German government to take the totality of Jews into the Allied
camp, and to evacuate and the other camp would care for them. This, of course, was a
revolutionary idea. It was probably the only great idea uh that could be conceived, but it
was immediately rejected by the British . The other idea was the constructive idea of a
basic joint effort to rescue, and he proposed five...a fund of five million dollars of
contribution from America, five million dollars contribution from uh United...from uh

Britain and two million from the Jews. This was sabotaged by the Jews. The Joint was
against it. The Joint was believing that they had a kind of monopoly on Jewish defense
and and and Jewish welfare activities, ._1 62 and the government shouldn't interfere. It
was an absolute basic mistake. When the war was over, our greatest asset was that we we
succeeded in in convincing the Allied governments, the UN, to participate and take the
responsibility for the surviving refugees. The was based was based and financed by the
governments, not by the Jewish organization. The UNDRA effort was based and here the
World Jewish Congress had an important role in in uh introducing this idea and this
concept. The the fact that hundreds of thousands of people were in need was not the
responsibility of private people. It was the responsibility of the uh world community,
which had not conducted world affairs in the way which could have saved these people,
and so uh both in number and both in the uh international refugee organization after the
war, the responsibility of governments and the financial responsibility of the basic needs
was recognized and we should have done it, of course, during the World uh World War
IL, but the the Jewish were not yet right for such a concept. Today it is absolutely obvious
that private organizations, private citizens, can only contribute to it, but the the basic
needs and the basic policies have to be financed by governments and international
intergovernmental organizations in order to keep the basic needs covered. ..

Q:We have about a minute left. Two minutes...I'm corrected. Uh Hillberg was once asked to
describe the most fundamental lesson of the Holocaust and his answer was anything's
