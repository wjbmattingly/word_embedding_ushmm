A: ...eyes and when somebody open up with a Schmeisser' from a side, it hit me right in the
top of the head, it practically scalped me. There was a big scar across, it was blood all
over. And my friend got hit, apparently the same set of bullets hit him right here and took
a top of his head. So I grabbed him and I ran with him for about 400 feet. And I could
never lift him because he was a big boy, about his size — your size.

Q: And you lifted him that day?

A: 1 lifted him, I grabbed him, I had his gun — his rifle and my rifle and some other items,
and him. I must have — I must have run about three or 400 feet before I ran into my own
boys and we put him down and tried to get help and of course he was beyond help
because his top of a head was gone. So I had my head fixed and then after war in
Germany, I got a good German surgeon and he cut it open again and left only a little, tiny
— I mean, it was a scar, I’m — it was enormous scar. So he left only a little, tiny scar there.
But I still — when I take my hat off, I kind of remember that blood running and the whole,
horrible, open thing there, just like my top of a head was completely open down to the
brains. But it wasn’t, the —

Q: But it was also seeing him, too.

A: It was, yes. So I keep my hat on, just about everywhere. I take it off in church and I—I
take it off when I go to bed. I keep it at — on at work. Everybody is used to it or if they
are not, they better be.

Q: Right, right.

A: There was — went to Miss Batchelor’s wedding. I had my hat on, and they had skullcaps.
And I was going to have a special skullcap made for me because I was the honorary
grandfather.... Right, an, an English speaking person can’t.

Q: How — how do you pronounce it again?

A: Czyzewski.

Q: Czyzewski.

A: See, a “CZ” is “ch,” “Y” and then “Z” has that dot above it, which makes it into “Z.”
Polish language has three “Z’s.” It has “Z,” “Z” and “Z.” The “Z” has an apostrophe, the
“Z” has a—a dot above it. It’s a funny language.

01:03:02

Q: I see, that’s why the dots are above it.

A: Yes.

Q: Okay.

A: And we have seven extra letters in our alphabet.

Q: Oh, you do?

A: Because “Z,” “Z,” “Z” — is as “C” and “C” and there’s “S” and § and it has “L,” “T” and
“E.” “EL” has a crossbar slanted on the top of it. There’s a “A” with a tail, which is “A.”
There’s E with a tail, which is E.

Q: Yeah.

A: Anyway, when Heather went to India — when Heather went to India she discovered she
said, “All those Polish songs, Polish words — I mean, in Sanskrit.”

Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It’s April 8, 1998. We’re in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, or nearby. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and it’s
tape one. And if we could just begin by having you introduce yourself and then also tell
us where you were born and when.

A: Very well. My name is Stefan Czyzewski. I was born in 1922, ina little town of
Lesnogora, Poland. Lesnogora is in central Poland, about 45 kilometers east of Warsaw.
It’s a small hamlet, you cannot even find it on a map, but it’s still there. Last time I wrote
to somebody there, it still was there.

Q: Tell us what it looked like. What it was like to grow up there?

A: To live there?

Q: To — in, in Lesnogora.

A: Oh, it was a farm — a farming community. There was no industry of any kind, just farms.
There was one little store, kind of a general store, one room little store, ran by a Jewish
family. The rest of the people were all Polish peasants working on a farm.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 3

Q: And what did your parents do? Maybe tell us their names and what did they do, were you
farmers?

A: Yes. My father was Jan Czyzewski, he was a farmer. My mother was Bogumila
Czyzewski, nee Boruc. My mother was an — was a schoolteacher. And she was a
frustrated schoolteacher. When she married and had a first child, which was me, she
would not be hired to work any more. So she was really frustrated. By a time I was three,
she taught me how to read and I never stopped. I fell in love with books and I have been
reading ever since.

01:06:05

Q: What was your family home like? Did you have land? What did your — just tell us a little
bit about that, what did your father farm?

A: Yes, we — the farms in that part of Poland were a kind of a variety farm. The land was
rather poor, so they planted just about everything that they needed and in — everything
they could sell. They planted a lot of cabbage and a plenty of potatoes and some wheat
and also a lot of rye. Our land was in many little pieces, so we had to travel from a
village to work on, on the land. My father — just about like me — spent a lot of time in
strange places. The part of Poland that we lived in before 19 — in — before 1900’s, were
occupied by Russia, Czarist Russia. My father was conscripted, or drew a lot and spent
12 and a half years in Czar’s imperial army. He came back home for six months and the
first war — world war started. He was called again and did fight on the western front
against — against Germans. And of course he heard some Polish people speaking across
the front lines, so he walked across one night and thought he would join them. Instead of
that, they put him in a prisoners of war came — camp. And they sent him way, way out
west, close to the western front line betw — a li—a front line between France and
Germany. And again, well he was — at that time he was a sapper. He was a fortification
specialist. So the Germans gave him a group of people, group of prisoners and they built
fortifications — a kind of a front line fortification system at Verdun. And probably
everybody heard of that horrible battle at Verdun, where more than half a million people
were killed. So he did, and the Germans of course, were very appreciative, so he put him
in a fr — one morning they put him in a front of a squad that he was in and gave him
German Ritterkreuz’ or, or Eisern—Eisernekreuz’ — German, German decoration,
because the part that he built there — the French could not overrun it. They tried several
time, they couldn’t overrun it. Anyway, a few days later, he heard Polish people speaking
across the line on the French side. So he walked across. And the Po — he joined Polish
Legion that was fighting on the French side. Couple nights later he led the French into
the part of the fortification that he built. They overran it, they kicked the Germans out

and the French gave him the Croix de Guerre’. So he had German decoration, he had
French decoration. Later on, the Polish Legion gave him Virtuti Militari,’ Polish cross.
So when my father came back home after the wars, he didn’t brag much about it. As a
matter of fact, my family didn’t know about it. I was the only one that he showed the
crosses to and he told little about what happened. When he came home, he brought some
things. He brought a French army coat and he brought a pair of American army boots.
And he had those boots until 1940’s. They were pair of clodhoppers. They had a big,
round toes, but he said, “Those are the best boots I ever had.” They were ugly, but he
said, “They are sewed, they are glued and nailed. You can never wear them out.”
Occasionally on — on a big holiday, he would put those boots on and para— shine them
and parade around it. And everybody was look and said, “Jan, where do you get those
ugly boots?” He said, “You better shut up, those are American boots, those are the best
boots I ever had.”

01:10:54

Q: So your father, when you were growing up, would — would talk with you about his
military experiences?

A: He talked a blue streak to me, but he would not talk to anybody else. And of course he
talked about all the girlfriends he had. The great Russian girlfriend he had. And the great
German girlfriend he had. And of course, he had a great French girlfriend.

Q: Tell us about your siblings. You’re — you’re not an only child. Who else was in the
family?

A: Yes, I had two sist— I had — have two sister, who are in their late 60’s or early 70’s. When
I was arrested, they were a —

Q: Their names, can you tell us?

A: Yes, the older one is Henryka. She is about 71. The younger one is — or was — is Eleanor
or Eleonora. She’s about 68 or 69. When I was arrested, they were like 12 and 14. And
two years ago, they came to visit me. And I said, “Well gee! I left two pretty little girls,
what do I see now? Two old, little woman.” And my sister Eleonora is outspoken, she
said, “Who do you think you are? You’re a old, little man.”

Q: What was a regular day like? Did you work with your father? Just describe a regular day
at your home.

A: We did get up at the sun raise, or before. And we did little work, like taking care of the
livestock, feeding the cows, feeding the pigs and watering the horses and preparing. And
then of course — then after that I went to school. And first three years, we had a village
school, was a one room village school. Later on I had to walk to the town of Grebkow,
which was our district, little village, which had seven grade school. So my time was spent
mostly in school. I would walk at seven in morning to get to be — to be in school by eight
and I didn’t come home until about three. So then I helped around the farm. And on
weekend, on Saturday, I would work with father in a field, but on a weekday, I did not.

Q: And what — what kinds of things did your family do in the community? Wh—Were there
political parties or any kind of small organizations in the village that they took part in?

01:13:43

A: There were political parties, but they were just practically two. There was the Nationalist
party, which was very small and hardly anybody joined it because they were kind of
chauvinistic and there was the so-called “non-party” party, which was the government
party. And most people were kind of — not exactly joining it, but supporting it, because
all the politicians and all the representatives were members of that party. There was quite
a lively social life. There were mostly — mostly religious holidays and feasts that people
took part in it. Like for instance, when the month of May came, every night after supper,
everybody went to a little shrine and they would be singing lot of hymns and they would
sing a litany to all the saints and then you would walk home and sing loudly. There was a
fair, one or two or three religious fairs, that special preachers would come to the church
and we would walk to church and listen to the preachers and there were booths and
souvenirs toe — tables. And food tables, where you would spend little money to get some
food that you normally did not eat at home. Well, every Tuesday there was a
marketplace, market day. You would — father would hitch a horse and we’d take some
butter and eggs and some grain and some potatoes and drive to Kaluszyn, where the
market took place and the people from a city would — housewife would come and buy
your butter and buy your eggs. And Kaluszyn was a town of about 12,000 people, of
whom about 10,000 were Jewish people. Jewish people were merchants, they were
professional, they were attorneys, they were doctors. They were tailors and shoemakers.
And we traded with them throughout our lives. We always had a family or two or three
that we’re very friendly with and visited when we went there. We would start their place
and maybe get a cup of tea. When they came to see us, we would give them a dozen of
eggs and when they came to visit on the farm.

01:16:25

Q: Well, how would you describe the relations in general between Jews and Poles at that
time? First maybe think about your village.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 6

A: In our village, there was one Jewish family. It was actually first a Jewish man, only, who
opened a little — like a grocery and needles and thimble store. Later on he had a wife and
two children. And relations were not strained. We kind of tolerated one another. All
Polish Jewish people were Orthodox people. They wore special dress, they had
sideburns, they had peyse®, the long side hair. They wore gabardine coats, they wore little
hats, with a — little tiny, black hats with a tot — little tiny visor. And they spoke very
broken Polish.

Q: For instance, did the children go to the school that you went to?

A: The Jewish children would go to public schools that all of us had to go. But, they would
spend little time there, but most of the time they spent was in a cheder. There was a
Jewish cheder, they went and they learned to — how to write Yiddish and some of them
would learn Hebrew. And socially we did not have much to do together. Socially, we
kept completely apart. We did not mix, or if they did, it was very little mixing between
the Jewish people and Polish people.

Q: Did you understand why? Was that ever sort of spoken, or was that just how things were?

A: That’s was how the things were. It was not a — because one hated one another, but was
simply because the things were. People gravitated to their own and they did little
association business-wise and also occasionally visited. For instance, we had had a—a
Jewish peddlers come. There was a Jewish lady, whose name was Golda, who came
carrying a big bag and she was trading. She brought sacharyna’ to sell, she brought
needles, she brought thread, she brought little pieces of material. She brought
occasionally a dress or two. And she would take in — in exchange, she would take eggs
and butter and some potatoes and maybe some grain.

01:19:20

Q: Tell us a little bit more about your family and it’s religious beliefs. When you were
growing up, how did your parents explain those to you? Wi-Wi — you know, in church
and that sort of thing.

A: We took the church for granted. We just went to church on Sundays. We went to
religious instructions, which were taking place in public school. Once a week, a priest or
a nun would come and take a — actually the priest or nun came every day, but took one
class, for one hour we received our religious instruction. And we went to special
preparation like for first communion or confirmation. We would go to church in groups
that — which reached certain age and were prepared. We prayed at home frequently, we
would say a rosary. Probably not every day, but at least once a week. And we kids hated

it because we had to kneel for about 45 minutes on a hard floor, so we squirmed and we
complained, but quietly, because father did not take any guff from any kid.

Q: So it was a part of your home life and it was certainly a part of your parents beliefs?

A: Very much so, yes.

Q: Was there a time, as you started to get older, that it became more something that you
believed in and it wasn’t that your parents were kind of asking you to do?

A: No, it became — it was given — it was given. We did not question. We knew that if you
went to college later on, if you went to university, you lost your faith, in parenthesis. You
lost your faith, because you started questioning. And you started not really believing the
stories. “Well, those are just stories, you know, Bible is a story and religious stories is a
story and life’s of saints, oh, just nice little stories. And the Christians and the lion s, of
course, were also just stories. Maybe true, maybe not. So you don’t have to believe any
more, huh?” But there were not many people who went to college and there not many of
those who went there, who lost their faith.

01:22:04

Q: You say you were in school, were you thinking about going to college, were your parents
talking to you about that?

A: Yes, they were talking about going not to college, but to go into middle school, which
back there, it was a gimnazjum,* it was equivalent of American college. And I was one of
the students who was halfway bright and I di— gi— did get grant. They call it stypendium.”
I went to — for two years to the city of Wegréw, which was about 15, 18 miles, it was our
county seat. I went to this —I call it gimnazjum, before the war came and ended it all.

Q: So how old were you when you went?

A: I started at — I was 15 and I ended when I was 17, when the war came, I was almost 17
when the war came.

Q: And was it obviously — how did your parents feel about you going?

A: Well, they wanted badly to go — to let me go, but they could not afford it. The fees were
steep. So I did get a so-called stypendium from the county. There were two kids from the
county who passed the examination and I was the second one. The first one was a girl

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 8
who was bright and I hated her. Competed with her all — all my grade four, five and six
and seven. And she just almost always beat me to it, except in the literature.

Q: So, was it hard for your parents to let you go?

A: Not really. They were so proud, they were so damn proud, I was ashamed sometime
when they bragged about it.

01:24:03

Q: Tell us what they said, what would they say about you?

A: “Well, he’s bright. See, he can read. He could read when he was four.” To take it back,
when I was about eight or nine, my uncle Bronislaus got married. They lived in a big,
ramshackle house. His wife brought a bunch of books. Those were th— those were the
books I was not supposed to read. They’re called in the French Romances. Of course I
did, I sneaked out and read them, I mean I just read them day and night. And of course I
got caught. My mother said, “Aha. Those books you are not supposed to read, but I guess
I won’t prevent you from reading it, so to counter with, every night after supper, after
you eat supper, you are going to read the Bible, aloud.” “Bible? What do I want to read
the Bible for?” “Well, you are going to read it if you want to or not.” So I did, for half an
hour, then 45 minutes, then one hour. The neighbor’s kids were laughing, “Hoo, he is
reading Bible.” Pretty soon the neighbors kids started coming in to listen, because the
Old Testament stories are fascinating, bloody and murder at times. Especially if you
come to the Book of Judith, I mean that was a real story. So, after supper, there’d be a
bunch of kids sitting, later on, in winter, I mean and we had no electricity, just a ga—a
kerosene lamp there. Adult neighbors would be coming and listening to those stories of
Old Testament, especially the Book of Judith when she — she went to sleep with him and
got up in a middle of a night, I mean the leader, the whole affair and this leader of the
Philistines — got up in a middle of a night, chopped off his head and took it with her. I
mean, those were great stories. By the time I was 14, I read the Bible aloud twice. So I
pretend to know something about Bible.

Q: What — at that point, what were you thinking your future might hold? Were you think —
did you have any idea of what you might do?

A: Well, it was a given that I was going to be a farmer. I would inherit most of my father’s
farm, pay off my sisters. I had different ideas, I wanted to live in a city and get a job ina
city, especially af- I, after I went for two years to gimnazjum, I was — I knew everything.
But I didn’t — we didn’t talk much about it because my father was a choleryk.'° He had a
short temper. If you said anything that he didn’t like, you got walloped.

Q: It sounds though like a very unified family.

A: Very much so. Kind of, but not exactly on a defensive, but very close-knit family.

01:27:03

Q: Think back to maybe six months or a year before the war broke out. Did — do you
remember a time when you noticed a shift in the tone? That you began to be aware that
something might be happening, and how — how did you become aware of a change —
possible change in your life?

A: We were very much aware that the war was coming. I mean, we — we just — we just felt it
in our bones. And the political shenanigans, negotiations and so on and so forth, we knew
we were going to fight Germany. We never expected to find the Soviets. We had, of
course, Non-aggression Pact with the So — pact with the Soviets. We did not expect to
fight them, but we knew we were going to fight the Germans. There’s a Polish joke, later
on developed, you know, when times were the hardest, the most difficult, people were
being killed, mutilated, arrested, sent to camps, gassed — the Poles made the best jokes.
We made the best jokes ever. Scenario — the Germans come from the west, the Russians
come to — from the we — east, who do we shoot first? Russians. Pleasure before duty.

Q: On that note, let’s change tapes.

01:28:32

A: You have to have a Catholic Bible.

Q: Okay. My mom does.

A: Does she? Okay, look in a —

Q: Yeah, she’s Catholic.

A: — the Book of — of Judith does not exist in a Patterson Bible.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: See, when the Bible was being translated —

Q: Right.

A: — the group of Anglican scholars appointed by Hen — King Henry, looked at it and they
say, “this, this, this and that and that—“
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 10

Q: Right.

A: — are not necessarily inspired, so we will leave them out. There’s Belgium and Reims,
France, they translated the Bible, the so-called Douai-Reims translation and they said,
“Whatever was good for Saint Jerome is good for us.” So they translated the whole kit
and caboodle.

Q: Okay.

A: Consequently —

Q: No, I’m sure she has that.

A: Consequently, 11 parts of Old Testament do not exist in a —

Q: Eleven? Eleven books?

A: Eleven parts, ele— not, not complete books.

Q: Okay, okay. Parts, right.

A: But the Book of Judith —

Q: Right.

A: And the Book of Daniel in lion’s den and few others don’t exist. Part of a —

Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We are outside of
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape two.
Think — if you can think back to — you were saying that you knew that war was coming.
To think back to — you know, place yourself and how did you know? Did you hear things
on the radio? Were there conversations that you had or heard? If you could tell us some
of those.

A: It was mostly news on the radio and also newspapers, also newspapers. We kind of
watched closely, all the political shenanigans. You know, our Ministers of — of Foreign
Affairs was going back and forth, was going to France, was going to Germany, was going
to England, negotiating and negotiating and Germans having more and more power and
asking for more and more of — of Poland. We knew that time was coming and of course
we knew we’re going to beat the bejesus out of the Germans, turned out differently.

Q: What did your father and mother say about it? What was the feeling back home in
Lesnogora, you were in school nearby, what wa— when you went home, what were
people saying?

A: It was a vacation time when those things went on, so I was at home. I was back in June
and there was June, July and it started at the end of August or first of September. So we
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 12
talked about a lot of it and father said, “Well, we can beat them easily.” And he wanted to
join — he wanted to join, but they wouldn’t take him. Said, “You old man, go back
home.”

Q: So, was there any fear?

A: There was apprehension, but not real fear. We kind of felt that, “Well, regardless how
bad it is, it’s going to be on the Western border. There may be a stalemate, they may be
going for some time, but most likely they won’t come here.” Of course, later on we, we
learned better.

02:03:14

Q: How did you understand what Germany was doing? I mean, how did you understand
Hitler and Nazism?

A: Well, first of all, we heard a lot of that perse-persecute-persecution in Germany. We had
some Jewish people who came and lived with our Jewish friends in Kaluszyn, who came
from Germany and told a lot how they were being “kicked around,” as — as they said. The
Germans had demands — wanted to have the northern part of Poland, the Polish corridor
that we had, going to the Baltic Sea. First they asked for free passage back and forth
between East Prussia and Germany. Later on, they asked for the corridor, they just
wanted there — they wanted Gdynia, they wanted Danzig, they wanted the whole
territory. And of course, Poland was not about to give it to them, so we knew that a war
was on-coming.

Q: When you say you heard about how the Jews were being treated in Germany and that you
heard from people that had been kicked — kicked around, how did you make sense of
that? Did you have any idea that this was a — a policy in Germany?

A: Yes, we did. We knew it was a policy of the German government. We knew — our press —
Pola-Poland had quite a free press. I mean there were Socialist papers, there were
extreme Rightist papers and the general press was kind of in between. So there was a lot
about the persecution of minorities in Germany. And also, we knew a lot about the
hoodlums who came to rule Germany. And we kind of wondered, especially in school,
when I was still in school, that winter and spring before the hostilities started. We talked
a lot with professors and we were greatly impressed always by the German scholarship,
by the German philosophy, by the German literature. And then we thought, how could
that ever happen, that the Germans let themselves be led — those intelligent, those bright,
those advanced Germans can be led by a group of hoodlums of that kind — of that sort.

Q: So think back to that summer of 1939 and tell us where you are, what you’re doing every
day and as we get closer to September, 1939, what’s going on? Are — are you being
recruited, are you talking with your friends about fighting, what’s going on?

A: That summer, we work on farm. I work — help my father on the farm, we — we it was —
everything was almost planted when I came home from school in June, but the harvest
came soon, first the hay. And the haying was done all by hand, even the mowing of the
hay was done by hand. And the first day of haying — of mowing the hay, when you came
home at night, you didn’t feel like eating, you could not sleep, your bone ached, every
muscle your body ached. You were pulling the scythe, mowing the hay all day. Second
day was better, the third day was nothing to it. Then the harvest came, of course and it
was a hot, dry summer. The harvest was quite good, so we harvested first the rye, then
the wheat, then the potato picking did not come until September. By that time, the war
was over, when we picked the potatoes, so it wa— else, was just about ending. It was a
summer of apprehension, a summer of some fear — what is going to happen? And of
course, when the war started, things started happening.

Q: What did you think was — was going to happen with you? What were your plans?

A: My plans were just about broken. I knew that I probably wouldn’t go to school any more.
And I was very reluctant to stay and work on the farm. And when the war came and we —
when we lost the war to Germans and the Soviets, I knew I was going to be stuck and
work on a farm with my father, which — I was quite resigned to it. Said, “Well, hopefully
the war will end and maybe I wi— I can go back to school and perhaps live — even live in
a city. But for now, I’m stuck here, so I better make the best of it.”

02:08:53

Q: Tell us where, where you were in those early days of September, in 1939 and when you
first felt the presence of the invading army?

A: It was — we knew that it was going to start soon, like in August. And we knew that
Germany was going to attack soon. And then we heard the news about the Polish — a
small group attacking Germany, in Silesia — it was a little town of Glewice, where a
German dressed up a group of their own soldiers in Polish uniforms and attacked their
radio station, took it over. And of course they had brought bodies from concentration
camps, dead bodies and dressed them in Polish uniform — uniforms and had some
casualties there. So we heard about that and of course, few days later, September first,
they attacked.

Q: I’m not sure I really understood what happened in that little town in Silesia?

A: In Glewice?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 14

Q: Yeah, in Gle-Gle—

A: Ah, it was a p —a put up affair by the Germans. They dressed up Wehrmacht"’ people in
Polish uniforms and attacked their own radio station. It was the incident that created the
war. They had the pretext, “The Polish — Poles attacked us and now we have to, of
course, defend ourselves.”

Q: How did you hear about it and how did you know exactly what had happened?

A: It was on a Polish radio, it was in — was in Polish papers. Polish intelligence at that time
apparently, was quite keen. And they knew all about it.

Q: So where were you — where were you when you first heard about that and what were your
thoughts?

A: I was in my village, listening to a crystal radio and I thought, “Well, it’s inevitable, the
war is co — war is coming and we’ll have to fight.” I was too young to — to be
conscripted. My father was too old. He, of course, wanted to go and join. They said, “Go
— old man, go back home. You had yours.”

02:11:20

Q: And when — how quickly did you feel the presence of Germans in your town?

A: Within about three weeks, they were, in our neighborhood, the — kind of a pincer
movement went around Warsaw. The — Warsaw was still fighting, but they went around
and approached our neighborhood. There was quite a sharp firefight in my village.
Started early morning — the Polish cavalry came in and some infantry came in. The
cavalry dismounted and sent horses back and they dug in on the periphery of my village.
They had a whole bunch of little, anti-tank artillery. Was two fat wheels, and a horse and
they could pull it like the dickens. Two men could pull that little thing. It was very
effective against German tanks. So they dug in and they were waiting, and of course, the
Germans attacked. And it’s kind of strange, my father said, “Well, why don’t you take
the cows to the pasture?” And my father dug a dugout for the family, in a garden in the
orchard, so they were — went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture
in the back — way back, beyond the village — it was a communal pasture. By the time I — I
did get there, I couldn’t come back because there was a — I mean, was honest to goodness
firefight. It was long distance artillery German — German artillery shooting. And a—a
kind of bombarding the neighborhood, there was a — more machine guns going all over,
so I just stayed behind the village, there, for about two hours. In about two hours, the
Poles retreated and went and then came two cavalry men, who said, “Hey, little boy, do
you know that little wood across the hill, there?” “Of course I know it.” “We have horses

"' Armed forces (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 15
there, about 15 horses, can you go and get the horses here?” “Oh, sure. Why not?” So I
started running, kind of over the hill — I run over the hill and there was lot of firing and
going and then I see — all of a sudden, I was kind of running on the border of a hi — of a—
of a field. The border was kind of a strip of grass, it was higher than a field and I see right
by my feet there, dust flying. And I didn’t think — think much of it, but it was somebody
shooting machine gun from a way, way distance there — German machine gun and hitting
right where I was running, below my feet. It was several times, right below my feet.
Apparently, whoever was shooting, was shooting little too low, thank goodness. When I
ran to — I ran over the hill, the horses were gone.

02:14:34
So I laid down behind a bunch of trees, big Olszyna’” trees. There were such trees here.
And artillery was shooting and hitting in — in transit was hitting a top of a trees and
branches were falling down. So I just laid there for about half an hour, then it slowed
down, I went back to the village, village was on fire and about two-thirds of the village
was burned. There were nobody — no civilian casualties. There were about 35 Polish
soldiers, who were killed. There were about 100 of Germans who were killed, back in
approach the village. There were about 11 tanks that were mashed to smithereens by
those little ca — Polish cannons. And of course the Poles ran away and the Germans came
in. We were taking — getting water in pails, out of a— out of a well and I was — I climbed
up on a top of a roof to prevent our house from being burned, because the neighbors
house were burning, so I was handed the pails of water, I was pouring on the — on the
roof of the house to prevent it from burning on. And the refugees who are running around
the Warsaw, the bunch — were a group of people from Warsaw who were running around,
“What will happen to us, what will happen to us? The Germans are going to kill us.”
Well, the German patrol came down the village and they just came, they didn’t bother
anybody, went across the village and went into the woods beyond the village, where the
Polish army escaped. And more patrols came and more patrols came. But they were very
correct, they did not bother anybody. They questioned a few men and they took
document — asked for documents and they did not bother anybody. In — in other places,
they would take young men and — and kill them. In our village, they were quite correct.

Q: So, almost your first — well, your first interaction with this war. You were essentially
involved in it. You got asked to come into it.

A: Well, kind of, but I was almost a bystander, but I was little foolhardy running over the
top of a hill where the shooting is going on. Of course I can —I could run. I said, “I can
run — outrun anything. Nobody can hit me — aim and hit.” And they didn’t.

Q: Did you tell your father this story?

A: Well, yeah, sure, of course I told him, I bragged about it. And he said, “Good for you.”
Because my father went with horses to the forefront, where the Polish soldiers were dug
in, he was doing some field work. And when there started shooting, he just stayed with
them. And he went to talk to them in a — in the — in foxholes, said, “You better go there.
Get on this side, get on this side.” “What do you know, old man?” “What do you mean
old man? I’m an old soldier. Right here get mutilated, get behind that bush. Dig — dig a
little foxhole there.” So they did and sure enough, long distance artillery shell came right
where they were and made a hole you can drive — ride horses in it. So they turn and said,
“Well, you old man, you — you knew what you were doing.” Well, they retreated. So he
went back with them and he wanted a rifle, but they said, “Why, we don’t give rifles to
civilians.” So of course he came home and my sisters and my mother and some of the
refugee from Warsaw women were in our dugout there. Of course, everything was
burning. The pigs were burning and squealing and — it was kind of a bedlam.

Q: That the animals were burning and dying?

A: Yes. We were lucky. Our house and our barn — animal barn — I mean cow barn and our
grain barn were not burned, so. We had a lot of people living with us for — after then.
Some were relatives who were burnt out, some were neighbors who got burnt out. We
had probably 35 people living with us. Was a three room part of a house. We cooked a
lot. We rescued some of the pigs that were burned and we lived high on the hog for
several weeks.

Q: What were those few weeks like right after that first firefight? Were, were the Germans a
presence in the village?

A: The Germans were not around at all. There was some German police, that went and
stayed with the Polish Blue Police in the Grebkéw by middle, my school village where I
went to grade fourth and up. And there were Germans in Wegrow , the county town.
There was a —a small army detachment. And later on — later, later on, there were
Germans — German cavalry standing in neighb-— sitting — staying in neighboring village,
but to my village, it came only for a visit. It was a time when they were apparently
preparing for the eastern front, but of course I wasn’t there then. I was way out of it.

02:20:29

Q: Well, what, what happened in those weeks that you — there were refugees living with
you, what was going on around you and what were people talking about? How were they
preparing to cope with their situation?

A: People were quite bewildered. They didn’t know exactly what was going to go on. The
civil administration was left intact, as it was. They had German supervisors, but on our
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 17
little district, there was not even a German supervisor. There was a count and there was a
district secretary and couple helpers, couple typists. There were a three man police force,
which was staying there and they got orders from a Germans, but not really any orders to
do anything unusual, just to keep peace. And of course, bunch of little boys — I joined the
underground organization immediately. I think it was in early — late September or early
October. We had a swearing in ceremony, one by one, in a cemetery. I can still remember
it by heart. That was the — that was the O.P., Obroncy Polski, '° the Defenders of Poland.

Q: Describe that and what — what — how did they swear you in? What —

A: Well, you swore in that you are joining the defenders of Poland and, “I’m going to obey
all orders by the organization. I will not disclosed any secrets to the enemy, regardless of
whatever happens and I will fight to the end for the freedom of my country.” That was
about it. I still remember it in Polish.

Q: Can you say it in Polish?

A: Not really. And we did — not much, but we did get together once or twice a week and we
talked and we collected arms and ammunition that was dropped by the Polish army, or by
the Germans. We had a German light machine gun. We had a Polish light machine gun
and we had a lot of rifles. I even found a six-shooter. It just — looked almost like a
American six-shooter. Of course I gave it away to my commander later on, because he
had to have a side-arms and I didn’t need to.

Q: How many people were in this group?

A: There were 12 of us. Just a litt— from two small villages, from Lesnogora and Zarnowka.
And of course, the swearing ceremony was very young and moving, you know, in a
cemetery.

02:23:32

Q: Could you describe it? Was, was it at night?

A: It was in the evening, yes.

Q: What, what was it like?

A: Well, the commander came from somewhere, I don’t know where, we’re not supposed to
know. And he administered the oath. You would swear upon your grandfather grave. And
of course I wasn’t with it for too long, because I took a little side trip.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 18

Q: So 12 young men got together and decided that they would fight?

A: Yes. Just a bunch of kids shooting off their mouth. I have glaucoma on my eyes on
occasionally. But it’s under control and my doctor says, “I’m going to make you see until
you die.”

Q: Do you have any particular friends from that group of 12? Were they your — were they
your—

A: All dead.

Q: All dead.

A: None alive. Mostly were killed. Most of them were dead by 1943.

Q: So what did you do? I mean, did you get into any —

A: Well, see when I — when I took my little side trip, they were in their organization. They
became an active, so-called active group. And they went on so-called wet works,
attacking German patrols, German moving troops, German riding on a freeway toward
the eastern front. And they did get mutilated. They got shot and killed and apprehended
and killed in prisons and — out of those, I don’t think anybody is still alive.

Q: So, very quickly you formed a sort of a secret underground resistance group and then you
awaited orders?

A: We awaited orders. There were group in almost every small village. Every two villages
they had a group. There was a overall command. We don’t know who they — we didn’t
know who they were. They came for a visit, they announced, by runner they would come
for a visit, we'll talk to you and they came and talked and gave us instruction and send us
trainers, who trained us for the things to come. But I took very little part in that, because I
went on a trip east.

02:26:39

Q: Tell us about that.

A: We had relatives and — who were in the Soviet zone, so-called, and it was — well I called
the, the man uncle, but he was just a distant relative, he was not an uncle. We had some
family things to do. I brought some documents to him that he needed. And when I came,
it was the night where they came. The Soviets NK WD" came with lists and took
everybody who was anybody in the Polish administration, with their family. There was a

“ NKVD
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 19
judgment night in a marketplace. There was a town of about 18-20,000 people. They took
1,800 people. Men who were in administration, who were teachers or preachers or
policemen or anybody who were representatives to Polish legislation. And the judgment
time took about four and a half hours. It was about like 37 seconds per person. There
were three men. There was a man sitting behind a table with a long list, civilian, kind of
weasely little person. There was a man sitting in a middle and a big, Russian officer
overcoat and a big hat, with a face, with a face — there’s a little Russian saying, “Morda
kirpicha prosit.!°” “A face that asks for a brick.” He had a face like that. On the right
hand of his, sat another civilian with a list, writing sentences. The person on the left, the
group of people, or a family, or a person would came that he would look up his name on
the list and he would tell — the person in middle that one looked up — and then he would
said — would say, “Twelve and a half, five and five. Next. Fifteen, five and five. Next.”
The one on the right would write a sentence. Twelve and a half or 15 or 20, means 12 and
a half, 15 or 20 years of hard labor in a prison camp, in gulag, in most cases, in Siberia or
Outer Mongolia or Kazakhstan. Five years of external exile, you could not come back.
Five more years of a loss of citizenship. “Next.” Some people questioned it. I said, “Sir,
but I haven’t done anything. Why?” He said, “This is Soviet justice, you don’t question
it, you questioned it.” “I haven’t done anything.” So, he said, “Well take him out and
shoot him.” “Okay, okay. It’s all right, it’s all right, I'll stay 15 years. I'll se— I'll serve
20 years.”

[Pre-interview conversation]

03:00:44

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It’s April 8, 1998, we’re outside of
Minneapolis, Minnesota. It’s conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number three.
Just want to get you to say the name of the town where this judgment was going on, that
you were just describing.

A: It was Szezuczyn.

Q: Can you spell it?

A: S-z-c-z-u-c-z-y-n. It was in eastern Poland and a little town.

Q: And at that time controlled by the Soviets?

A: Yes, it was on — in the Soviet zone.

Q: And this is November, 1939?

A: November, 1939. Anyway, when we came, I mean when they came to my uncle’s pla— I
mean to my relative place, said, “You are ready in 15 minutes, take whatever you can
carry. Your wife, your daughter, your son and who is this?” I said, “Well, I am a distant
relative, I am just visiting here. So my suitcase is still un— not unpacked, so I will just
go.” “Where do you think you are going?” I said, “Well, I go back to a German — into
German zone where I belong, where my family is.” “Oh no, you are relative? This is
Soviet justice, you go with him.” “No, I’m not going. I’m going back home.” “Oh, you
are not going, huh?” “No.” “Take him out and shoot him.” “I am going.”

Q: They really said that?

A: Yes. “Take him out and shoot him.” “I am going.” So my suitcase was packed and I — we
went together. Anyway, his daughter, who was almost sevent— almost 16 and I was 17,
we got light sentence, 12 and a half only. Twelve and a half. And my uncle got 15, his
son got 15, my aunt got 15 years. We were — after the judgment we were loaded on the
trains and we went and we went and we went, for about five and a half weeks. We went
across the Soviet Union, we went across the Ural Mountains. We went at far — as far as
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 21
the River Lena. It goes — I think it starts in a Balker — Bikal Sea’® and goes up into the
North Sea. And then we went up the River Lena, some in a train, some in boats. We got
to within a short distance from the Arctic Circle. We’re put in a camp and we felled trees.

03:03:17

Q: Can I ask you what those trains were like? Were you standing, did they give you food?

A: No, those were a — those were cattle trains that bunks were built. There was a pot-bellied
stove that you could feed as much as you wanted to. And there were triple bunks and I
don’t remember how many people, about 50 people in each car. You know, like that 18
men and fo— and — and six horses, or six horses. There were about 50 of us, I think about
52. They kept the famil— let the families be together. Yeah, we did get to the camp and
we f—

Q: Were you scared then?

A: I’m sorry?

Q: Were you scared?

A: Not really. We stopped places, they gave us food sometime, there were Russian people
who were a — on little stations looking and talking to us. And if we — some of us had
some money, they wanted Polish money or they wanted goods. They figured a piece of
clothes, they could get some good food. We bantered, we laughed, we sang a lot. It was
just accomplished fact, nothing to do — you can do about it. The guards were not very
bad. If you wanted to run away — if you tried to run away, they shot you. That’s about all
they could do. They did not mistreat us. We just went like on a nice vacation. Slightly
apprehensive.

Q: Where — what did you think was going to happen? Where — did they tell you where you
were going?

A: We didn’t know a thing. We didn’t know a thing. They told us “Idyosh na poselenie.'!”
You are being exiled. “Na poselenie.'*”

Q: Your parents didn’t know where you were?

A: No. My parents knew I disappeared.

03:05:56

Q: So tell us what it was like when you did get there.

A: We put in a — in a barracks. Some people were put in a tent, I was luc— because there
were not enough cabins. They were log cabins like barracks. But we kept building more
of these log cabins. There were two, big pot-bullied — bellied — pot-bellied stoves that we
fed as much wood as we wanted to. If you were close to it, you were sizzling. If you got
little away from it, you are freezing. You know it’s a nice cool place there, huh? Forty-
five below zero, is nothing to it. It used to get to 72 below zero. We — it was 72 below
zero and heavy wind, we did not have to go to work. So every night we would kneel
down and say, “Good Lord, let it be 72 below zero tomorrow and heavy winds, so we
stay in.” Well, if it was 71, nothing doing. If it was 72 and — and wind, you went anyway.

Q: Did you have warm clothes?

A: We had clothes that we came with and also they had the prison clothes, which is quilted
kind of a gaber— I mean, kind of a poor material, like a — like a lining on a poor jacket,
quilted, with a cotton in between. The down stuff is quite warm. And we had walonki,”®
which were felt boots, which were issued to some of us. So you could survive. You could
survive.

Q: So what did you think when you got there? I mean, what did you think was — was going
to happen?

A: We thought that we will try to survive. Since they are not taking it — us out and shooting
us offhand, as they frequently used to do, that we knew of. The damn Communists used
to do that to people frequently. We thought that we would try to survive.

03:08:05

Q: So what — what was a re — describe a regular day.

A: Waked up in su— before sunrise, counting — Appell’’, counting. You got a pot of tea,
which was made out of birch leaves. You got a little, tiny piece of bread, maybe half an
ounce or so. You ate it. Then you dressed up and you went walking. If you remember,
about four or five years ago, where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo, they showed the
Russian Siberian man, who was a weightlifter and a wrestler, how he ran a mile in the
snow that deep? This is the snow we walked in. It was two guards and about 50 of us and
we walked. And the person who walked ahead was changed every hundred feet or so. If,
for — sometime for punishment, if they made one person walk all way, a mile or two or

° Felt boots (Polish)

?° Roll call (German).
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 23
three miles to the place of work. He — by the time he got there, he was dead — breaking
the snow. So we went — we cut trees for about five hours, then came soup at noon. People
came with sleds from a camp, with big kettles of fish and cabbage soup. It was mostly
water. We sat down and ate the soup, then we cut tree — trees again and stacked them and
came back. Six p.m., we started on the way home, we got there by seven or so. Were
counted again, got another pot of tea and a little slice of bread and of course to sleep. We
had a good guard. I mean he was a damn Soviet, but he was a good guy, the guard. I
mean, he was just out of this world. When we did get there, said, ““Tea. Make fire.” So we
made fire. “Make big fire. Sit and rest.” So we sat around and rest. And he looked at his
watch, he had a Polish watch that he stole during 1939 campaign, said “polsky chasy.”!”
Polish watch runs well. “Go and cut.” So we went and cut for about, oh probably one
hour. So then, “Hey, come on back.” So we came back. “Sit and rest. Soup coming.” Oh,
in about one hour, soup came. “Eat.” We ate. “Sit and rest.” We sat and rest. “Go and
cut.” So went and cut for about one hour. And he — then he went — came to us there
where we were. “Now, go and steal.” So we went stealing. A prisoner had to cut a cubic
yard of wood a day. And regardless how young, how strong, how big you were, you
could never do it. If you didn’t cut a square yard per person, your group didn’t, at night
your soup was cut, your bread was cut accordingly. Next day you were weaker. In a week
you were gone. So we would go and steal the wood that we cut day before and day before
and day before stack it up, he would measure it. “Okay, now we sit down and rest, we go
home soon. Make bigger fire.” So we went home. That Ivan Ivanovich was a damn good
man.

03:11:47
Also, I was lucky. I spoke some English, I spoke some German. I spoke Russian quite
well. When my father and mother wanted us kid not to know what was going on, they
spoke Russian. My mother was a Russian teacher in middle school before she got
married. My father was of course, Russian speaking person. So we kids learned it in a
hurry. We knew exactly what was going on. On the train for six weeks, by the time we
got to Siberia, my Russian was almost as good as my English. Much more colorful
because I knew a lot of swear words. So they found out and I was called to the
commanders office and he said, ““You stay here, you translate.” And he got the German
word, “You dolmetscher.””” “You interpreter.” I don’t know how he got that German
word, I knew what it was, but “You dolmetscher.” When new prisoners came, I would
get up on that barrel and I would shout, “His Excellency, Commander so and so says this
and says that and says that. You don’t do this, you don’t do that. You get shot for this,
you get in solitary for that. You get hunged up for this. So remember.” And of course,
after a few days, I — one time a group of Czechs came and I got up on the barrel and I
became kind of — took it for granted, became rambunctious — young, stupid kid. And I
said, “Commander Mika-Mikhail Ivishenerovich, that son of a dog says this and this and

*! Polish watch (Russian)

>? Interpreter (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 24
this.” And in Polish it’s skurwysyn,” in Russian, it’s sukin-syn.”* In English, of course,
you know what it is. So he came and he knocked me down and he kicked me. Said, “You
little so and so, you called me sukin-syn.” Said, “I called you Excellency, and Excellency
in Polish — in Czech, and sukin-syn sounds almost close together. I call you Excellency.”
“Oh no, I know Polish and I know Czech, you call me sukin-syn. If you say that again,
I'll shoot you, you little so and so.” Said, “Commander, I did not say it, but I will not sa—
ever say it again if I did.” I thought my goose was cooked, but it wasn’t. So I stayed in
barrack, I peeled potatoes, I swept the barracks. I had a norm man, a man who wrote the
norms for the people, what people did during the day. I helped him do the norms. The
classification, how much soup at night everybody gets. And I learn how to cheat, how to
write up — how to cheat so that people made more than they did. Anyway, I made it.

Q: You were with your family still, right?

A: I was with — I was with my family still. About 11 months later, when Hitler attacked the
Soviets, Polish und— government in exile in London, negotiated with Stalin and those of
us who received less than 50 years were — 15 years, were released. So my little cousin
girl and I were released. It did not make any difference to my uncle, because he was
dead. My aunt was dead. Their son — who was as big as this young man, and strong and
sportsman, he was dead. Two little weasel-y thing, that little girl and I were still alive.

Q: How did they die? Did they die in — in the work camp?

A: Died hard — hard work. Mistreatment, beating occasionally. Some guards were vicious.
Some guards were not as good as Ivan Ivanovich. I still say a prayer for him
occasionally.

Q: For him?

A: For him. We did get out. We were allowed to go to southern part of Russia, where Poles
are being collected and Polish army, to fight with the Soviets against the Germans, was
formed. Some of us crossed into Iran. The Soviets had a hard time taking care of all of us.
Iran was run by the Russians and the British. We did sneak into the British part. The
British trained us, armed us, fed us — formed Polish second corps under Polish General
Anders.” They went to fight in North Africa. In Egypt, North Africa, all way to Tripoli.
Later on they went fighting in Italy, all way to Monte Cassino.

Q: At this point were you still with your cousin?

A: My cousin — women and — and children were bundled up and sent to India and South
Africa. They build camps for them to stay for duration. After the war, they were all sent
back to Europe.

03:17:42

Q: How was your strength after 11 months? Your strength?

A: Mine was all right. I had enough to eat. I had a sideline. After about seven weeks there, I
was allowed to go out. There was a little settlement, winter settlement. They wer— they
were the Samoyed people. Siberian people like American Eskimos. Samoyed people
raised reindeer and fished. So I went and wandered around and a young boy came and
talked to me, he said, “Who you are?” “Kto vy takoy?”” So I said, “Well, I am Polish.”
And, “Chto eto takoy??”” “What is that?” Said, “Well, I am from a country way, way
west. Just like your Samoyed country, the damn Soviets took us over, they took you over
and beat the bejesus out of us and sent us here to work in a camp.” “Uh-huh. You
hungry?” “Of course I’m hungry.” “Come and eat.” And Samoyed build, build — live-in
yurtas. Yurta is a kind of a conical tent made of bearskins, double bearskin — four out and
four in. And it’s kind of a good size, about the size of this living room here, about 12, 15
feet in diameter. But if you get into the yurta, if you — they use a — long handed hatchets,
like American Indian tomahawks. If you pick up the hatchet and put it like this and take
your hand off, the hatchet will stay there, the air is so thick. The Samoyed had people
wash twice a year, if they have to or not. And they cook, they sleep, they make babies,
they do everything in the yurta. I mean the smell is overpowering. But they say, “Never
mind, pribyknyesh”™*® — you get used to it.” So I ate a lot of fish and the young man said,
“You come tomorrow?” “If I can, I come tomorrow.” So he gave me some fish, I took the
fish to the camp. I shared some with the guards, I shared some with fellow prisoners.

03:20:16
Next day I couldn’t go, so third day I went and, “What is your name?” “Stefan.” “We call
you Stepka. Khorosho, kak Vas velichat’?”°” “How do we call you?” Velichat’”, it
means, you use you name, your father’s name. So I said my father was Jana. “Okay,
Stepka Ivanovich, come on and eat.” So we ate. “Yi- How much time do you have?”
“Oh, some time.” “We’ll go fishing.” So we went fishing. So they gave me — gave me
harpoon and we walked, on the River Lena. And I fell in. I didn’t know what was what.
River Lena is a very brisk river. The ice that time was probably 20 feet thick, but there

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 26
were wash-outs, little bubbles. If you step on the bubble, you go in. I was lucky, I had the
harpoon. So I fell only in — that way I got wet. It was not very cold, just about maybe 25
below zero. So two of them grabbed me and ran back — ran to the — back to the yurta
where I s — I stripped. And he said, “Well, I loan you my suit.” His suit was made of
silver foxes. Big pants up to here and a big parka, with a big, huge hood — silver fox
outfit, and reindeer. It was soft as silk. Because this man had three suits and he had three
wives. Good Siberian women can make only one suit at a time. She has to chew the skin.
Siberian wives has teeth just about three millimeters long, where they constantly chew
the skin. You — you tan it and then you invert it and you chew the inside of it to make it
soft, and becomes — either the chewing process or the saliva makes it as soft as silk. So I
wore his suit. Went fishing again, we caught some sturgeon. They made a hole ina
bubble, we got some sturgeon, we came back. We cooked some fish, we ate some fish.
My suit was still wet so he said, “You wear my suit.” So I went. I was the best dressed
prisoner in the whole damn Soviet system. I came, everybody’s oh-ing and oo-ing and
the guards and especially the chachainsis.*! There were bunch of chachainsis.
Chachainsis is a bunch — a bunch of son of a guns. They are cutthroats, they are thieves,
they are murderers, everything. They kept looking. “Oh, too bad he is so small. Oh, too
bad he is so small. We would take it off you.” “You wouldn’t take it off me.” “I
wouldn’t?” I said that, “What would you do to me?” “Cut your head off, you stupid so
and so.” “You little so and so, you would cut my head off? We cut your head off.” They
frequently would — if somebody wa— had something they didn’t— didn’t want to give,
they would come and cut his head off at night and took whatever they wanted. Anyway,
they became my friends and protectors. I don’t know why. I was just like a, like a little
to—a flea, in comparison with them.

03:23:50

Q: Did you get to keep the suit?

A: Of co — oh I kept it for duration. Later on, that man said — well he was a chief’s son, he
had three suits and three wives and 700 reindeer. So he said, “Well, I got enough, two
suits, you can — Stepka, you’re my brother, you wear my suit.” So I wore his suit for the
duration. And when I — I was ready to leave, I went to visit him and he said, “Well,
you’re going to stay with us — I mean all the time, stay with us. You can marry one my
sister, you can marry two my sisters. You can marry three of my sisters if you want to.
You my brother, you stay with us.” So when I went to say goodbye, I brought his suit
back. I said, “I’m sorry, I have to leave. I want to go and fight for my country.” So we
had a good cry and I went away.

Q: What was his name?

A: Was —

3! Chechens (Russian)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 27

Q: His name?

A: Krugly.** That means the round one, Krugly. I could not pronounce his Samoyed name,
but he was Krugly, the round one. He was a tough, young Samoyed, with three wives. He
didn’t have any children yet.

Q: So you knew when you left that you would probably go back to your country and try to
fight?

A: I hoped so, I hoped so. Well, we’re told by the political officer, by the politruk® in a
camp that, “You are going to join Polish forces, you are going to join our victorious Red
Army — are going to fight the damn Germans.”

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We are outside of
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape
number four. If we could start with the last day or two before you left the Soviet work
camp, how did you find out you were leaving? How did you leave? Where did you go?

Q: It took about say a we — about a week before we could leave. We were — there was an
announcement, you know, in a square, very official — lot of high rank officers came and
said, “We did not want to hurt you — you — we knew that you are our friends and now —
from now on we will be allies and you are going to fight the — fight the German
aggressor, so and so and so. And those of you who are not really criminals, traitors and
all — all of us were tr— tried under clause of high treason, paragraph 150. Even I was
under high treason — 150, 150 sub-paragraph — subparagraph 12, subparagraph 17 — high
treason. What for? Anyway, it took us about a week before they went — we went down
the Lena river. We were up the ri— Lena river. And then we got on the train and we got
collected — assembled on — close to Iranian border. And there was such a multitude of us,
they couldn’t take care of us. So they said, “If you want to volunteer and go across there,
we have our people there, too.” So we sneaked — we went across and then we sneaked
into the British part. And of course, British were forming Polish army and everybody
who was anybody wanted to join it. Instead of joining those damn Communists.

Q: Did you say goodbye to your cousin? Did you realize you might not see her for awhile?

A: Yes, we said goodbye and she was whisked away. In about — after we moved to the
British zone there, we were together for about a week. And we — they collected all
women and children and she went to India. Some went to South Africa, but she stayed in
India for the duration of the war.

Q: And when you say — tell us a little bit more about sneaking into the British side. Who did
you do it with, was it a — a night that you did it? And how did you do it?

A: Well, we just — actually, we just walked. And the Soviets stopped some groups. Some
groups were not even bothered with. Especially groups that had women and children and
they didn’t want to bother with. We just walked and hoped for the best.

04:05:50

Q: So if you — if you could just describe it for us. Where did you walk to and — and when — I
mean, where did you spend the night, how did you find the British officials?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 29

A: Yeah, it was close to — it were close to Teheran, it was west of Teheran. It was kind of a
desert area and there was some local people who traveled with herds of sheep and such,
from place to place, so we would stay overnight with them. We just sleep outside, it was
— you know, subtropics, it was warm and the — the British built camps already, so we
went to the camp that was built for the refugees, by the British. And of course, pretty
soon they started asking young men to come to lectures and come to training and, “Do
you want to fight?” “Of course, what do you think? I’m going — I came here for it.” And
many people joined. And then I don’t know if I want to divert. I think I will have to
divert back, before I — I left Siberia. About six months after we be — were there, they
fished out 17 young boys, between 16 and 19. And I was one of them and we went
through a heavy indoctrination course. Eight, 10, 12 weeks, eight hours a day. Heavy
indoctrination course. And if you — if I get the three of you in a secluded place, that you
are not allowed to leave, in about two weeks, you’ ll believe any — everything that I will
tell you. They — there’s nothing better than Communism. Dialectical materialism is the
only doctrine that works among peoples. Soviet Russia is the most powerful, most wise,
most — the best of all, the richest. We have the riches in Siberia that you never heard of.
We have enormous Ukrainian plains that we can — if we — planting our grain, we can s —
we can feed the whole world. This is the best. You had to listen closely, you have to
listen attentively. If you smirked, if you made a face, if you make a funny remark, you
were thrown — your shoes were taken, your jacket was taken, you were thrown into
solitary, which was six — what — four by four feet. Your shoes were taken, too, overnight.
You had to dance, jump, run all night. If you sat down, you never waked up. Well, I was
lucky, I spent only three nights. I couldn’t keep my tongue. I mean I couldn’t keep my
mouth shut. I had to make remarks. I made faces, I laughed in his face, the politruk was a
big man, had a face that was asking for a brick, too. I just sm— laughed in his face. And I
told him once, “How little you know.” So he was lenient with me, but still he, still he
throw me in, in the solitary, one night at a time. If you spent two nights, you didn’t make
it. Some people — there were a few people who made it for two nights. Three nights
nobody made, in a row.

04:09:33
Anyway, by the time we graduated, we had a talk, 45 minute talk. And if you missed two
words, you were thrown into solitary, had to repeat it. You had to give a lecture that told
everything about the dialect — dialectical materialism. You knew all about Engels™, you
knew all about Marx.*> You knew everything about Lenin.** And you most about
Stalin.*’ I mean those were the holy — not a trinity, but a quadruplinity. And you had to
talk about them in glowing terms. Your tone of your voice had to be just like a great

> Karl Marx

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 30
sermon on a mount. And you know, by the — by the end of it, I believed, strongly. I
became a honest to goodness believer. So when we were later let go and I think it was
somewhat with premeditation that this little group was let go into the British part.
Because we going to be the avant-garde of Communism. We are going to get introduced
into armed forces or whatever groups there were and we’re going to propagate it by
going — we are going to be the true believers. And there — for some way or another, the
British knew it. They collected us again. We went through a heavy indoctrination by the
Polish political officers, by the British, who some spoke Polish, some worked with the
translators. In about three weeks we lost the faith. We lost the true faith. And then they
formed the armed forces. Yes, let’s say they went to fight, they fought, fought all way to
Monte Cassino. By Monte Cassino — when they took Monte Cassino, the second Polish
corps — after British and the Australians and the Americans couldn’t take it, they were so
bloodied, they were sent to recuperation—

04:11:40

Q: Remind me where we are at this point. I know where we are, but I mean, what year is it?
You’re now — it’s—

A: It was 1941. 1941 summer—

Q: And you're outside of Teheran?

A: Out of Teheran, last — late summer.

Q: And you're getting — you’re getting training from British and from Polish?

A: ...and from Polish, we’re getting training. So my 17 were re-indoctrinated, re-
brainwashed and trained in sabotage and demolition. The whole 17. They were bright ki—
I mean, of course we were bright kids. We got to brag about it a lot, I mean we used to
brag a lot about it. “We are the best of the best.” Were trained in sabotage and demolition
and the underground work. We were put in small groups. We went back to Poland.

Q: Before we go back to Poland, I want to know a little bit more about what the training was
like. Take us through a day of training.

A: The training was in the morning, was calisthenics. There was a five mile run. There were
four hours of lectures, in — mostly about small arms training and the firefights. Mostly
firefights, being surrounded — being surrounded by a superior group and getting out.
Constantly, constantly, constantly.

04:13:10

Q: You mean how to escape when you’re surrounded?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 31

A: How, how to fight your way out. How to fight your way out. Then in afternoon was
another lecture, which was a political lecture, whom we have to fight. Then of course,
kind of a — the lecture would, would tell about how we do fight the Germans. “But, if you
want to, you can fight the damn Russians, too.” And by nightfall, you fell sleepy, you fell
off your feet, you slept. And the same and the same. And then sabotage, blowing up
bridges, blowing up trains, blowing up buildings. Demolishing rail — train tracks, if you
did not have explosives. And a lot — a lot of training with semi and automatic weapons. It
was a time when the British introduced a sten gun and we trained a lot with the sten guns.
We trained little with regular rifles, but they said, “When you get there, we will provide
you with sten guns, you will have a lot of firepower.” And a sten gun is similar to
American Thompson submachine gun. But it’s a piece of junk, actually. You shoot about
1700 rounds and you throw it away, because after 1700 rounds, becomes more dangerous
to you than to your pos— opponent. Anyway, seven of us went on a trip. We walked, we
rode trains, we hitched up rides on the tracks. We rode donkeys most of the time. We
went through the western Iran, into northern Iraq. We went through the Kurdistan. By the
way, the Kurdish people are the greatest people ever. They can cut your head off, if you
have — if you have something they like, but if you come in, it is so much like in — in
Poland, “Guest in, God in.” They treat you like you were a god visit-visiting them. They
give you food. They give you — what they have, they share with you. If you are ragged,
they will give you shirt or pair of pants. But don’t look at anything good they have,
because they will give it to you. If you look at something, “Oh gee, this is so neat.” They
will let you sleep with his — with his wife if you like her. But you get out of a tent, they
will follow you, cut your head off and take the stuff back. So we’re told, “Be careful with
the Kurds.”

04:16:00
Anyway, we walked through part of Turkey, we diverted into Syria and backed in
Anatolia, Turkey, Anatolia. We did come to Bosporus Straits and we were kind of
pursued at that time, we knew something was happening. We were being hunted. So we
met a old fisherman on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian. He was an old Turk who
spoke Russian. And said, “Grandpa, please take us across.” And he said, “Lords, night is
falling, there’s going to be storm tonight, we cannot get a — go across.” “Grandpa, please
take us across, because we — if we don’t leave here tonight, we may not be alive
tomorrow. We know something is happening.” The German had a Intelligence pe—
Intelligence people in Turkey and they organized pursuit parties, we overheard before
then. So he said, “Well, Lords, I’m old, my boat is leaky and if you want to risk, what am
I to say?” So we said, “Grandpa, we’ll pay you.” “I don’t want to be paid.” So we said,
“Grandpa, we’ll give you the donkeys.” “Donkeys, they’re not worth anything. They are
worn up completely.” Said, “Grandpa, you give them on a p — good grass, they’Il be as
good as new in two or three weeks. Leave them here.” We got in the boat, he gave each a
—each one of us a piece of rope. “Tie yourself ti— s — well.” Storm came. It was the
scariest five hours I lived in my life — scariest. I was in dark places, but this was the
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 32
worst. I think I fell out about four times. If it wasn’t for rope, I wouldn’t be talking to you
tonight. The Mediterranean fish would have eaten me up. Anyway, we did get to the
Turkish side on the north side of — it was almost morning. Beautiful, quiet, sun was
coming up. And the old Ismael said, “Lords, the Allah was with you. I don’t want to be
paid.” But before we left, the British gave us some gold pieces. “Case you're in a tight
spot, trading, whatever.” So we said, “Grandpa, we don’t want to pay you, we just want
to give you baksheesh, a gift from the heart.” And each one of us gave him a gold piece.
He looked, said, “Oh my Allah. My granddaughter will get married, my younger
daughter will get married, my grandson get married, I can pay dowry to every one of
them and I’m going to live high on the hog for the rest of my days.” He got in his boat
and a little breeze came, he just zoomed out of there.

04:19:05
And we walked across a part of Turkey, went into Bulgaria, we caught rides on trains —
tracks, we head into Romania. We sneaked into Nazi occupied Poland. You know, the
front li— eastern front was way, way out. By that time, on Polish territory, the Germans
developed Einsatzgruppen,** special forces. They call them Einsatzgruppen or
Vernichtungsgruppen,” the exterminators. So they were killing lot of Jewish people and
they were killing all the Jewish people they could find. And they were killing a lot of
Polish people. So the Polish underground suffered for a time. But then, when we came,
they provided us with arms and ammunition and some unstable Polish dynamite. And we
— each one of us — I was given 17 people. Seventeen plus two, plus — plus me. That were
20 people. And we became the exterminators of exterminators. We would create false
alarms. Because when something happen in certain village or little town, they would just
swoop upon it. They — those groups were about 100, 75 to 125 in each group. They
would swoop around, swoop in, surround it, burn it down, kill everybody. That was their
standard procedure. And when they went to a ghetto, they would just kill all the Jewish
people in the ghetto. Of course, ghettos were already fenced in — barbed wired in. So we
did few things with them and we blew up — we could not blow up — blow up complete
bridge, but we blew up parts of a bridge. We demolished a lot of railroad tracks. We blew
up some trains when we had explosives. And I was — oh, my gosh, my commander was a
—I still don’t know his name. His name was, was “B. Dab” — “B. the Old Oak.” He said,
“You little shit, ’m going to shoot you, I’m going to court martial you, you missed it.” I
would sit in a field with the two wires and a battery, holding here and I would touch it
and the damn thing would not explode and the train would go by. Or sometime I would
blow it up before the train came. So after each incident — mishap like this, he would gave
me a dressing and threaten me with, with an execution and court martial and God knows
what. He was a big, fat man with a very sharp temper.

04:22:03
And we slept in bunks. We slept on farms that were far away from habitations. We had
dugouts in half a dozen different forests. Run around constantly. We did get surrounded a
lot of times. We had to fight — were in lot of firefights with those groups. Were
surrounded frequently by them and had to fight our way out. And about — in 1943, it was
‘42, fall and winter when we started. Forty-three, in late spring, we hijacked German
army bank on a street of Warsaw. We lost three people out of about 25 or 30 that were —
but we got a lot of money. We got about 15 million marks. Each one was — one of us was
given a bonus, and you were given operating expenses. I think we — my group got about
half a million marks. And I had a drinking buddy, who was a young, German soldier,
supply officer. So we had drinks, we met few times. I introduced him to some Polish
girls. And we talked and he sold me about over 100 Schmeissers. Schmeisser is a light,
automatic weapon, similar to American Thompson submachine gun, but much, much
more effective. Much more effective. And I don’t know how many, probably about 12,
15 million rounds of ammunition. So from then on, my little group of 17 plus three were
carrying 27 Schmeissers, because some of the boys said, “I don’t trust that damn German
weapon, | want to carry two.” So I said, “Well, you know, we have a — we join — we
shared those with some other groups, but we have plenty of it in places, hidden places. If
you want to carry 17 extra pounds, what am I to say? Go ahead, be my guest.” The
German groups — ordinarily each squad had one Schmeisser and the rest of them had
manual Mauser rifles. So when we — from then on, we — on purpose, did — when it cato—
came to firefight, let ourselves be surrounded. And then when we opened up, we went
just like a hot knife through a piece of butter. They had to keep their heads down, or they
lost them. And anybody who stuck their head up did not get up again. So we went out
and went out and went out and — course we were losing people. At the start we lost like
11 people in two months. So the boys who were in my group said, “What do we do?” I
said, “Well, I tried to train you, you refused to be trained. You think you know
everything. You were as full of beans, you want to fight, well do — surely we fight, but
are going to lose people constantly if you don’t want to train.” So they said, “Do anything
that — to train us.” So we did. For about four weeks, we got the guts out of ourselves. We
did it the British way. The way the British Major Thompson did to us, we did to
ourselves. From then on we became almost invincible. We would lose a person from time
to time, but very, very seldom.

04:26:00

Q: You took some time and sort of dropped back in the countryside and —

A: We drop back to countryside, we took a week or two off, then we — most of the time we
found the places we wanted to take care of ourselves. Sometime our commander would
contact us and gave us — gave us an order to do this or to do that. And there was a — one
of the Eisengrupp — Eisens — Eis — Einsatzgruppen in neighborhood where my — not
exactly my own family neighborhood, but close by. It was in a town called Biala
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 34
Podlaska. It was about 100 kilometers east of Warsaw. There was the group that was
large, it was very well entrenched. Very, very foxy, we just couldn’t do anything to them.
So he called me the carpet and he said, “You are supposed to take care of that group. You
don’t sa— you don’t have to kill all of them, but really give them a good thrashing.” I
said, “Commander, I tried — we tried everything, I tried everything, nothing works.” Said,
“You have to do something.” “They are entrenched. They stay in a solid building, which
used to be monastery, with a great gate. They built a wall around, there’s some barbed
wire on the top of it. There’s electricity in the barbed wire. We just can’t touch them.” So
he said, “Well, we can, come on here.” Led me to the next room, open a wardrobe and he
said, “Look at this. You see this nice, little Hitlerjugend*” uniform?” And I said, “Oh, no
you don’t.” Said, “Oh yes, I do.” And as you can see, I was a little blonde boy — little
blonde boy, this one on the right. This one here, with blue eyes and very, very bleached,
bleached hair. So he said, “Put it on.” So I put the thing, fitted me just right and a little —
little — little jacket, shorts, you know. High socks, hobnail boots, little dagger, little hat.
Said, “There, you look like a damn German Hitlerjugend.” So I didn’t have much choice.

04:28:40
In the afternoon, the boys brought me within about two or three blocks from that
monastery. I just walked toward the gates, there were two burly SS men with the
Schmeissers standing by the gate. And I said, “Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler.*’ Wie geht’s denn,
Junge” “Ganz gut."*” “How are you young man?” “Very well.” “Wie geht’s denn, Herr
Oberst.**” How about you, Commander? “‘Ganz gut.” So I said, “I - Ich wiinschte mit ihre
officer gesprochen.**” I want to speak to your officer, your commander here. “Weiter-
weitermachen.*®” “Go right in.” So I went in, I went through the corridors, I went up the
steps, I went to the back there and there was an outside window, I unlatched the window.
I went downstairs again, I went to the back and I notice there’s a gate there with a bolt, so
I pulled the bolt slowly out. Then I went to the corr— second floor again — again had to go
to second floor to go to the front, so I walked. There was some secretaries running out
and some officers running back and forth. “Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler, Junge."” Wie
geht’s.**” I walked out. Said, “Auf wiedersehen,*”” to those nice, two, big son of a so and
so in the front. Walked out to the corner, walked beyond — about a block away, the boys
are waiting with the car, they grabbed me, we ran away. I was so mad at myself. I wet my

Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization.

pants. My pants were wet, my socks were wet, my shoes were squelching. I must have
been afraid. And strange enough, I was in tougher places. I was being shot at, I was being
hit, I was being mutilated, practically, but this must have been scary time that I had had.
Was first and the last time that I wetted my pants. That night we came in and the
commander came with us. B. Dab came with us. He said, “You know where everything
is, so you go in.” So I went with my big rucksack. And then we came with a ladder, we’re
going to climb to that window there.

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We’re outside of
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape five.
So you were going into the—?

A: Yes, lucky enough, they did not board the back door. But we came with big oil cans and
we oiled all the hinges, you know, and — and my commander said, “Well, you know
where everything is, you will go in.” Said, “Me? Was supposed to be somebody else
going in.” “Oh, shut up and go in.” So I went in, I set sev— set up 17 charges, one for
each boy in the outfit and we blew the place sky high. It just blew up. There was a
armory, and I notice where it was, I put a charge on the door to the armory. Whatever
they had there — it must have been a lot of explosives — blew up. And of course, some of
them were running out of the front gate and the back gate and we met them in the street,
too. And I don’t know how many were left, but there were some left, I presume. And of
course, then we took off and — and got the hell out of there. That was a feather in my hat.

Q: Where would you go after something like that?

A: We just went out for — far away from it, as far as we could from the neighborhood.
Sometime we had horses, sometime we had horse-wagons. Occasionally we would have a
truck, produce truck that we “borrowed” from the Germans. Well, we would just stop a
driver and take him away and appropriate the truck. Take his uniform and one of us
would dress in it and we would have it ready after a job like this. And actually, this thing,
strange enough, did not have many repercussions. “The armory blew up. There’s —
something happen, the armory blew up.” The German papers were saying, “the armory
blew up and some of our people were hurt.”

Q: Maybe they didn’t want to acknowledge that there was —

A: They did not want to acknowledge, apparently. So then we had a week of rest. My
commander said, “Now you deserve a rest.” And I said, “Are you going to gift me with
that Hitlerjugend uniform?” “Oh no, that is useful — that will be for somebody else. You
pissed it, you so and so.” I said, “Listen Dab, I was scared.” “Well, I think you were
scared, but you should have been scared before hand, not when you were right there.”

05:03:10

Q: What did you do when you had a week off? A week of rest, as you put it.

A: Occasionally, I would visit my family, but very seldom. But most of the time I would
stay in the forest and enjoy it and bring some good food and have a drinking party. And
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 37
occasionally we’d have a drinking party with the Mongol people. Wanted —wanted to
demolish a track, or a trail, demolish a train. And the Germans had the Mongolians, from
outer Mongolia, who volunteered to serve the Germans. They placed them along the
railroad tracks to guard it. So, when we wanted to blow up a train, we just go for about
two or three kilometers and collect bunch of those people and invite them to a party.
Course they had to come if they wanted or not. They didn’t want to get shot. So we
would provide a few gallons of moonshine and some smoked meat and a lot of bread,
we'd have a party with them, get them roaring drunk and then we would wait for the — we
knew when the train that — in question was coming in there, with armament or with a
group of soldiers going to the eastern front. And we would try to blow it up. Sometimes
succeeded, sometime not. After we — after not, my commander would call on me and
said, “You little so and so, what’s the matter with you? Losing your touch?” I said, “Yes,
sir, lam losing my touch.” “Let that not happen again.” “Yes sir, it will never happen
again.” If it happened next time, he said, “You forgot you said never again.” “Well”, said,
“well, I thought I— maybe I would be dead before next time.”

Q: Were you wearing uniforms at all, or were you —

A: No.

Q: — just —

A: No.

Q: You were in — how — how did that work? Were you — and then in civilian clothes?

A: We had civilian clothes. We had kind of a sports — like a sweatsuit set, something similar
to it. Somebody of a got hold of German overalls. Occasionally — later — later on, after we
appropriated a lot of German uniforms, those that were not very bloody, we would — we
would wear. Matter of fact, we had them tailored, beautiful tailored. We had a Jewish
tailor, Mr. — Mr. Grzebien, who could make a beautiful fitting outfit, regardless what it
was. And poor Mr. Grzebien did not make it.

Q: So —so if you — I guess what I’m trying to get a sense of is, were you openly an army unit
in Poland?

A: No, we were not.

Q: Or were you — you were passing as civilians and then at certain times you’d go—

A: We were passing a — we were passing as civilians.

05:06:02
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 38

Q: Okay.

A: But most of the time we stayed a unit — we stayed as unit and went constantly from — we
did not stay in one place for more than two nights, went from place to place and found
the places to hit and found the places to demolish or got orders to move here or to move
there. And then, after we felt that we were too unnerved, we would st— we would take a
few days rest. Occa-occasionally some of us would go for a short visit, but very seldom
because Germans had also quite good Intelligence. And they had a lot of local people
who were reporting to them. So you had to be careful where you go, when you go. Like,
for instance, I don’t know if I was that religious, but frequently on Sunday I would sneak
into the church, to my pastor. And he was friend of mine, I read all his books. I read all
the books in the public library and school library and I discovered he had a big library, so
I read all of his books and I served Mass. Oh my God, I served Mass forever, I was 19
and 20, I still served Mass. So he would say, “Oh Stefan, come on, serve the Mass.”
“Father, I can’t. I messed up last night, I blew up a train. There were people on that train
-—,” or else I did something. “Come on, I’ll listen to your confe— I’1l hear your confession.
Come on, serve the Mass.” “But I’m too old.” “Oh, you’re so little, nobody will know.”
So he gave me key to the wardrobe, he kept, “Put your — put your items in a ke—” I put —
put my trench coat and my Schmeisser and a bunch of boxes of my magazines of
ammunition in his wardrobe, lock it up, serve the Mass. And then he said, “Okay, now
you can go.” So before he walked out, I would go into sacristy, unlock, jump out of a
window and disappear. He was a good old man.

Q: Do you remember his name?

A: Yeah, Ksiadz” Miazga.

05:08:22

Q: This was your parish priest?

A: My parish priest, Ksiadz Miazga. He was older. He was patriotic. And I would tell him
that I really can’t serve Mass, nor can I go to communion — what I did. “I can’t sleep
nights, my conscience bothers me, cause some of the people that we exterminated were
not really willingly going there.” Said, “Everybody who is Ein— in Einsatzgruppe went
willingly. And if you did kill some soldiers on the train, some officers, this is a war.”
Anyways, I still occasionally spend sleepless night. So, it lasted — it was good when it
lasted. And then in spring, early spring of 1944, I was caught in a lapanka. Lapanka is a
round-up, like they caught slaves in Africa, like they go hunting and have a — surround
meters and hunters. In Poland, the lapanka was an institution. The group of German
Schutzpolizei*’ would stop a train or a bus, mostly train, get everybody out, fish out all

the young people, put them in trucks, take them to process, processing, transit, camp
building. And in our district, was the Skaryszewska, it was an — name after the — after the
street in Warsaw, “Skaryszewska” — processed you and sent you to compulsory labor in
Germany. It was called the “free labor.” So I left what I was carrying — I was carrying a
suitcase of dynamite and some wiring, so I left it on the train. It was — I was a little boy,
caught on a train traveling between Warsaw and — and whatever.

05:11:03
And of course I was sent to western part — I’m sorry, eastern part of Germany, Silesia.
Then there was almost like a — like a slave market. They took us to that Kreuzburg town,
small town like a county town, Kreuzburg. We were kept — put in a — in a building next to
a square — there we be walked out to the square and then farmers and people from
different little factories, shops and so on, would come. “I'll take this one, I'll take that
one, I’ll take that one.” “Okay. Here’s your ai-,” they filled out an arbeitbuch,” a little
work book for you — your name and your employers name and you went and you were
servant to that person. If you got to be on a farm, it wasn’t too bad, because you had
enough to eat. A group of us — the group of us, about 25 boys and 23 girls, between like
13 and 19 or so, were put in a village called Schorka and we worked in a forest, natching
out the trees, pine trees and collecting the resin. Resin was used by German industry for
making synthetic rubber. So we worked there about eight hours a day, worked in a group
with a supervisor. And sometime the Stadtpolizei** worked with us, they try and they did
not. So, some of us would be escaping now and then, of course, they would be
apprehended and brought back and so on and so forth. And I worked there for, oh,
probably three or four weeks. So a small group of us took off and went away. So, “I
would — won’t work for the damn Germans here. Let us go home.” And the home was a
general government the center of Poland, which was so called “Free Poland,” it was
under — it was a protectorate, Hans Frank was the gover-governor and it was run by the
Germans, for the Germans, by the Germans and the Poles who were there had to give
everything that they produced, they raised on the farm and so on, to the German war
effort. But you were kind of semi-free. Anyway, those of us who were in the underground
were free because we could go anyplace we want to.

05:13:47

Q: So you just walked away from Schorka — from the resin work camp?

A: Yes, yes. I w —just walked away. Partway home, close to town called Lubliniec and
closer to little town called Blachownia, we split — we got chased by some
Volksdeutsche™ people with shotguns. And I ran into couple young boys and they were

the chlopcy z lasu,”° the boys from the forest, who were in the same part of Polish
underground that I was. So we talked, we introduced ourselves. And he says, “How come
—,” asked, “where are you from?” “Oh, I am from Warsaw district.” “How come you’re
here?” “Well, I got caught, spend time in Germany, now I’m escaping.” “Okay, come
with us, we have a job to do. Are you — do you know anything about wet works?” “Oh, a
little.” “Well, you know, there is a Gestapo man who is such a son of a bitch, he mistreats
people, he beats people, he shot some people, he killed some people during interrogation.
And we want to do something willa— with him, but we are not — we got the sentence,
death sentence for him from the — our underground authorities, the NSZ.” The National —
NSZ, which was the National Armed Forces. Narodowe Sily Zbrojne,” in Polish. That
was the — kind of a rightish wing of the Polish underground. The Armia Krajowa’’ — the
Home Army was kind of a middle — the A.L., A.L. — Armia Ludowa”® were the
Communists and we were the — toward the right somewhat. “Well, we are NSZ — we are
NSZ and we have problems, we don’t know how to proceed, so we —,” I stayed with them
for a few days and got some arms from them and instructed them and they were still
afraid, so we did — we went and we did the job, according to the rules.

05:16:18
We met him in a park, with a wife and two children, one was in a carriage, one was
walking. So we ask him to excuse himself and we excuse the lady and we walk him a
short distance, we read him the sentence. And of course after we left, he — he was dead.
And I should have known better, I should have gotten the hell out of there, but I stayed
for a few more days and there was somebody who reported. And they came and I was so
well trained and I became sloppy. I was too lucky for too long. I survived too long. I
became sloppy and careless and my goose was cooked. I stayed with a family in a
Blachownia — Blachstadt(ph) in German. And it was kind of a storage room in a
backyard, I stayed there. And they came at about one a.m. We had a shootout. Two of
those two who first came in, one was dead and one was badly wounded. And they shot
across and they killed another one of their own. And I jumped out of a window, I thought
I would — I was free to get out. And then I got hit from behind. I don’t know what
happened after that. When I was up to — I had a few broken ribs. I was badly kicked and
mutilated, practically trampled into the soil in that little garden there. And then — that my
—my gar — goose got cooked. They transported me to Lubliniec, which was a district
town and a investigator came from my neighborhood, east of Warsaw.

A: German, yeah. Gestapo officer came from Warsaw. He was Ph.D. from Heidelberg
University. He was highly educated person. And he joined the Nazi party, of course. He
didn’t know any better. And he became special investigator for the Gestapo. He
introduced himself and when he came in, the people who led him in, they said, “Where
you from?” So he told them. And said, “You know, wir hat die schlange, wir hat die
schlange.°”” “We have the snake.” Because where I came from, they call me the
schlange™’ — the schlange, yeah the Germans. Because I lived forever and lasted foreve-
forever, so they called me the snake. “Wir hat die schlange.” We talked for five days and
for five nights. He would not let me sleep. He would go and take a nap now and then,
somebody else talked to me. After five 24 hour talks, he said, “You know, I think we
became friends and I th— and I thought you were going to tell me everything that you
know. Really, I’m your friend. I don’t want to hurt you, I want to do anything. But you
didn’t tell me a damn thing. So we’ll try something else.” And I was just out of my —
completely out of myself. I was sleepy, I was hungry, I was thirsty. So the first thing he
did — he would — they would give me a little water now and then, but I don’t think I ate
anything for those five days and five nights. So then the first thing he did, he brought a
big dish of ice water and gave me a big spoon. He said, “Sit and eat. If you don’t finish it
off, I’m going to shoot you right here.” The most horrible thing in you life can be eating
ice water with a spoon. What — it was probably a gallon and a half, maybe two gallons. If
you try sometime, this is almost like a Chinese torture, maybe even worse. I ate the whole
darn thing. And I was just getting out of my mind. So he would not let me go to the
bathroom, so I just sat in a chair and made a big puddle on the floor, several times.

05:21:17
And then he called two men — two big, strong men and they gave me hell for about two
hours. I was in and out several times. I didn’t know what was happening to me. Then
they would pour a pile of water on me, I would come back to it and they gave me — and
beat me again. So then he asked questions and I apparently didn’t tell him very much, so
he said, “Okay, take him in a swing.” So they took my clothes off, they tied my hands on
and — my hands like this, put a broomstick here, put it on the top of the stools and I was
swinging back and forth. And one of them was swinging hose, rubber hose, hitting my
behind. “And talk and tell me this and tell me that. Well, you know about si— something
about this?” So I was prepared, I told him blue streak. I told him — oh, I told him tall
stories. All the people, all the names, who were dead. So then he left me — left me alone
and he went and checked and he came back. He said, “You didn’t tell me a thing.” So
they gave me beating again and beating again and beating again. And then he said, “Well,
that’s enough, we are ready.” So I had a — and normally, I mean, they just took out — they
shoot you. They shoot everybody in the neighborhood and this case, they wanted to be so
legalistic, they wanted to be so exact, that I had a case in court. I had a defense attorney,

°° We has [sic] the snake (German)

6 Snake (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 42
Mr. Heinrich Schmidt. Yeah, Heinrich Schmidt. And he was telling — he was talk to the
court — it was the Volksgericht.®! People who did not have any training in law, appointed
by the German authorities to deal punishment sentences. So, my attorney was asking for
three death sentences. And the — I don’t remember — or did — I don’t know if I ever knew
the name of the judge. He said, “Two, enough. Zwei ganz genug. Zwei ganz genug.”” So
he gave me two death sentences. And then he stamped ““N and N” on my document. “N
and N” is, is “Nacht und Nebel.°” “Night and fog.”

05:24:05
A person who got a sentence — who even did not get a sentence, but had an N and N on
his documents, he was sent to concentration camp, he was finished off — taken to the gas
chamber or given an injection — phenol injection. Or went to the bunker to starve to
death, or got mutilated or got hung in a — in a camp square. His documents were
destroyed. His ashes were — his family was not notified to send seven marks for the
ashes. You disappeared just like in a night and fog. So I was the Nacht und Nebel baby. I
stayed in prison, in Lubliniec for two, three weeks. I healed. I could sleep on my back.
When I got there, I could sleep only on my stomach. There were 17 of us in a two person
cell. We slept like sardines in a can on the floor. And the one who was the latest, had to
sleep next to kiibel.“ And kiibel was a garbage pail that everybody emptied themselves.
So I slept next to the ktibel for about a week. And of course I advanced, later on. But
after about two or three nights, they looked at me, at my back and they said, “Well,
maybe you should move little here. Maybe we can put you in that corner, there,” ‘cause I,
“you don’t look so great.”

Q: What do you think gave you strength to endure that?

A: I don’t know. I was ornery. I was so damn patriotic. And I was very strongly religious.
And I was very ornery.

Q: Good combination.

A: Yes. It was a good combination.

05:26:25

Q: Did you pray during those days?

A: Yes, I did. I prayed a lot. And I — actually I never prayed for anything. I prayed — I still
have a ta— hard time praying for anything. Like for instance, presently I pray in
thanksgiving that I’m still alive, can take nourishment, I can run a mile, I can skate, I can
do some skiing. And I’m 75 and counting. So I never prayed for something, not even for
release, not even for a longer life. I knew I wouldn’t live to be 20. I was sure I would
never live to be, to, to, to be ninet— 19 and a half or 20. I was — by that time I was almost
19. I never — I knew I was not going to live. But I prayed and I was so thankful that I was
still alive. Anyway, after the sentence, I stayed there in a prison for a short time, then I
went on a transport to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, which is in western Poland
presently. At that time it was in eastern East Germany, close to Opole, German Oppeln. I
was there in transit, in the block number 12, which was a subterranean block. It was a
time — it was just a time when Polish Prince Radziwill® was sent to Gross-Rosen. The
Germans wanted him to from Polish government under German auspices and he refused.
So they sent him to concentration camp. He was a brother-in-law of Mrs. Kennedy.
Kennedy’s — Mrs. Kennedy’s sister married one of the — his — that Polish Prince
Radziwill, who was in Great Britain then. Anyway, Prince Radziwill came with a servant.
And after they were told that sup — they took him — the ser— took the servant away. They
gave a black number, black triangle and sent him to the stone quarry. And the person who
received black triangle was — went to sa— to stone quarry, was not to survive. So his Kapo
told him, “Prince, I’m going to kill you, over the next week or two, so if you want to
jump, go ahead.” So he jumped.

Q: Were you there?

A: No.

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We’re outside of
Minneapolis, Minnesota. It’s conducted — this interview is conducted by Katie Davis and
this is tape number six. First of all, I just want to say that this is May 1994, about and you
were just telling the story of the prince. How, how — you didn’t witness that, but—

A: No, I didn’t have to witness, but I spoke to one people who had a black number and was
in the quarry. He came and by that time I developed a friendship with a Blockiltester,°
who was a Polish young boy, who was killing people right and left, to survive. Killing
prisoners right and left, to survive. When I first came, we got into that barrack, we were
put three people to the bunk and a bunk was about two and a half foot wide. Three people
to a bunk and bunks were three piles high. So I went in the corner between the bunk and I
stood against the wall, because my back, my seat, my — was kind of awful. And the
Blockaltester was a young Warsaw boy who became a killer to survive. He came and he
said, ““What do you think you are doing, you stupid so and so?” I said, “Well, I am
resting.” “Get in the bunk.” I said, “Blockltester, I cannot get in a bunk.” “Why not?”
So, I turned around and lifted my clothes. “Uh-huh. Come on.” So normally, when you
said, ‘come on’, you were going to get 25 with a ax handle or — or a— or a rubber
truncheon. So he led me to his little room and he said, “Take your clothes and lay down.”
So — “This is my bunk, lay down.” So I lay down and he brought a — a towel, he brought
a pail of water. He washed my back. He had some kind of an ointment that he put on me.
And he said, “You cannot turn, can you?” I said, “No, I cannot turn.” “Okay, you can
sleep on my stomach. I can go and get my — see my girlfriend.” So he went. Before
morning he came back and said, “Now you can go back there and be one of the prisoners.
And don’t let me catch you again standing there. Go to bed. Cause if you don’t, Pll kill
you.”

06:03:03

Q: Did he mean it?

A: Yes, he did. There were some people who were in position, occasionally they would give
you — do you a favor. But don’t ever ask them for a second favor, because that was the
end of you. I met many people like that later — later on in Mauthausen. Anyway, I stayed
there for a short duration and just about the same time, a bishop from my archdiocese — I
can’t ever remember his name, from Siedlce, came. He lasted only four days. They put
him into Strafkommando.” People who were carrying big loads of stone with a
wheelbarrow. So he was pushing a wheelbarrow, he was an old man — I mean he was old,

he was in his 40’s or 50’s. And he — the Kapo® beat him constantly. He survived either
four or five days. They beat him to death.

06:04:13

Q: Were you working at that time?

A: I’m sorry?

Q: Were they having you work at that time?

A: No, we stayed in the barrack. We were a kind of a zugang” people — new prisoners in
transit. So about — I can’t even remember how many it was — eight or nine days, we put —
were put on a transport and went, and went, and went all the way to Mauthausen. Came
to Mauthausen, got shaved, got disinfected, went to the showers, were given a pair of
clodhoppers, wooden shoes and a prison uniform and went to a barrack. Barracks zwei
und zwanzig” — the first quarantine. There was a main camp and a first quarantine. First
quarantine they had barracks 21, 22, 23. After that there was a wall, there was 24 and 25,
but those were the bunker barracks, where people went, never to get out. Anyway,
barrack 22 was the barrack of the people with “N and N.” So we went to a little chamber
where they gave shots, phenol, derivative of gasoline. It is the most horrible death you
can ever have. You die for about 45 minutes. That courses through your veins, gets into
your heart several times, and you just die in a horrible torment. Just the worse thing ever.
I saw dead people who died that way. They looked like the gargoyles on Notre-Dame
Cathedral. Or they went on a transport, or went to Gusen Zwei,’ never to come out. Or
they went to gas chamber, or they went on special transport behind the front line. If
something happened behind the front line, in a town or village, they would hang 10, 15,
20 local hostages and let them hang there for — sometime for weeks. If they did not have
local people, they would bring people from concentration camp and execute them there.
But for some strange reason, after a very short time, I was whisked out, my number was
read, I was put by the gate with 500 people. We marched again to the train depot, which
was about like three, four kilometers, through the little town of Mauthausen. Put on a
train and went to Vienna. And put in a concentration camp which was a sub-camp of
Mauthausen, 11" Bezirk” kolo Wiednia.”? And we’re put to work in an armament
factory. It was an Ostermann-Sauer Werke, which built tractors and cars. It was a Swiss-
Austrian-American company, built cars and trucks. At that time, they built Tiger tanks.

And I became a great machine operator. I mean, I learned in a hurry. I had a good master.
He was a German engineer, a civilian. He put me on machine, he showed me how to do
things. I was turning openings and grinding the huge blocks for the big, big heavy motor
for the — was a horrible work, it was 12 hours a day. The food was bad. Most of what we
were supposed to get, the people who handled it stole and ate and gorged themselves on.
It wasn’t too bad, actually. When I think back, it wasn’t too bad. I got beaten a few times
by the SS men, but it wasn’t too bad.

06:08:42

Q: Why? What would you do that bothered them?

A: Well, I think it’s — you — you looked wrong way, he came and slugged you. And one time
—oh, my gosh, I never forget that. There was a little SS man, my size — big, fat thing. He
was just kind of a, a roly-poly thing and he walked with a rifle. The rifle was three times
as big as he is. And we walked the factory in a fives — you know, row — I mean fives — in
kind of marching. And I look and I said, “Look at that little son of a bitch. He is my size
and he is so damn fat. If he falls over, he is going to roll forever.” And he understood
Polish. And he got after me. And the boys hid me and we were just in the gate, so I ran
quickly into the factory and got to my machine. And he was walking back and forth and
watching and walking, looking for me. And every time he walked, I would duck behind
the machine. I had a young Russian boy working with me, I would duck behind the
machine. And he never found me. He would have probably finished me.

Q: Your mouth, your mouth did get away with you, didn’t it? Get away from you
sometimes.

A: I couldn’t escape that. Many times my mouth ran away from me.

Q: So how long did you stay at this armament factory?

A: It was a chore for the authorities. I stayed there from — oh my gosh, from October,
November, until the second part of January, I think. I think so — does it say so?

Q: Mm-hm.

A: Yes. Because — because every...

[Technical conversation]

A Yes, the situation was such, they had a —I was a, I was a bloody headache for them.
Because every four weeks, two big, burly SS people would bundle me up, take me on the
train, we would go to Mauthausen, 120 kilometers in the train and I would be taken out to
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 47
the Politische Abteilung”, Gestapo office outside of camp. I would be asked some
questions and I would get the treatment that I couldn’t sit for next two weeks, and back to
work. Every four weeks, every four weeks.

Q: They continued these interrogations and beatings?

A: Interrogate my case. The reason why they didn’t finish me off was because, “You’re case
—Du kleine Schlange,”° your, your case is not yet finished. Your case is not yet finished,
so we have to ask you a few more questions.”

Q: But what were they asking you?

A: “Well, what happened then? Did you blow the train? How many people in your group?
Give me their names. Who was your commander? What are the other groups around?
What did you go this place? When you go that place? How come — how come at one
time, you were by Smolensk? How come at one time you were by Minsk — the Soviet
Minsk? Can you explain? Can you tell?”

06:12:44

Q: And what would you do?

A: Well, I made the tall stories, I talk blue streak. I tried not to repeat myself, I tried not to
change what I told before. As I said, I do — I did have a good memory. I could memorize
pages and pages of — I could memorize the 45 minutes of a propaganda talk. I didn’t miss
a word the second time. Anyway, and they would let me go. “Well, that’s enough for
now. We’ll see you in four weeks.” So the authorities in Vienna apparently got sick and
tired of it, so for a time, they put me on a bomb squad. There were fifee— 50 people and
after Americans started bombing Vienna — they came first in All Saint’s Day, in 1944 and
bombed the bejesus out of Vienna. They say there about 1200 American super fortress
came. You couldn’t see sun, you couldn’t see anything for three days — fires. And they
kept burning — Bezirk, district, 21, 22 and 23. All those three days. And finally they hit —
there was a Tiergarten,”° there was a park there and under the park there were enormous
tanks — buried tanks of aviation gasoline. And they finally — the third night they hit, and
the thing was boiling horribly. Because my factory lost all the roof too and we worked,
you know, January — worked practically outside. We danced, we jumped. We tried to put
cardboard in our jackets. If you got caught with a cardboard, you were beaten severely,
sometimes shot. So finally they got tired of it, they took me back to Mauthausen.

Q: I want to ask you a question about the interrogations, though. They — they went on for a
long time and they were brutal. Was there ever a point that you said, “You know, I can’t
do this any more?”

A: Forget it. You do it. You do it. I tell him, “I don’t remember any more.” “Oh, you
remember a lot. We will try something else.” So then something else, when I came back
to Mauthausen, the first two days — I was on block 22 again. Block where people got —
who were not supposed to leave. And two days later I was called in and there said, “Well,
we’ll try something else.” So they made me take my shoes off and I — leaned me on a
chair and beat my heels. And this is the most horrible feeling. When they hit your heel, it
feels like your brain wants to jump out. And — it was part of it — one of the stupid,
untrained henchmen hit my foot and broke a m — broke my — my — some bones in my
feet. Now I am a walking barometer. If— if the rain is coming tomorrow, I know there is
going to be rain, because my foot bothers me. My heels were just like balloons. So I
talked to some prisoners there, they said, “We just yell a lot.” So, as from then on,
whenever they took me there, before they hit me, I would scream bloody murder. I would
yell, I would swear up and down. I would talk in Russian, I would talk in Polish. So they
brought Russian and Polish interpreter, thinking that I was going to spill something. I
would just talk blue streak. And I knew little Samoyed language, I would talk some
Samoyed, cause then they would — later I’m sitting down, “What did you say then? What
did you say? What did you say then?” I said, “I was just complaining.” ““What was the
language you are talking to?” I said, “I was talking in a language, probably Latin.”
Because I — I had several years of Latin.

06:16:50

Q: But when you got back, did anybody take care of you? You must have been really hurt
when you would get back to the barracks.

A: Oh, you were just dumped a barrack and you took care of yourself. I get some friends in
the barrack who occasionally would bring me some — like an ointment from the
Krankenhaus.”” Actually the block secretary was a Polish man who took pity upon me
frequently and he would bring me something. But I had a bunk all to myself, not two or
three people, but to myself. At least after — for a week or so after I was — I went through a
treatment. So I was in that barrack and was in a barrack and then of course and, and
actually that interrogation and my ““N and N” came — I mean it came to pass in late
January, I think.

Q: Was this ‘45?

A: I went — yes.

77 Hospital (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 49

Q: Nineteen forty-five?

06:17:50

A: Forty — ‘45, ‘45. My number was list — it was called and a few other numbers were called
and were called, we’re taken to the Grosse Tor,”* the great gate. And I said, “Oh-oh. I
guess my cooked — my goose has been cooked.” So we were taken, 12 of us — we were
taken to Effektenkammer”. Effektenkammer was that bi g warehouse with the best,
beautiful thing, that came with people who went directly to gas, were stored. Beautiful
suit, beautiful boots, silk underwear and so on. So we got dressed like a — dressed well. I
got silken underwear, I had beautiful socks. I had beautiful Hungarian boots. Woolen
suit, tie — silk tie, fur hat, fur coat. They would put us by the gate and the prisoners were
come in and said, “Man, look at the bunch of Jewish barons. What did — where do those
come from?” And one of my friends came by and I said, “Hey.” He said, “Don’t hey me,
you so and so civilian.” I said, “Didn’t you recognize me?” And he says, “No, what are
you doing in that stuff?” I said, “God knows. I was dressed up.” He said, “Uh-oh.”
Anyway, when we’re — when we were in Effektenkammer, I had a friend — a friend who
works there because I work part time before then, in a Kanadakommando™ sorting those
goods. So he gave me a bundle of jewelry. He said, “If you go on a trip, maybe you can
buy your way out.” And he gave me a Polish marine knife. So I tucked it in. We’re
standing there and pretty soon, SS squad came and we hiked to that depot, about three
kilometers to the train and they put us in a prison compartments — went on a trip. And on
the train, there was one SS man who was coming back and forth — coming back and forth,
looking. And he came to a window, I, “Herr, Herr Ober— Ober— Herr Oberst, can you tell
me where we are going?” And he looked, he said, “What is u — what is worth to you?” I
said, “Two carats?” “Ganz gut. Hand it over.” So I gave him a ring with a big diamond.
“Well,” he said, “La himmel, la himmel.®'” “To paradise.” He said, “There’s a little town
east of Oppeln — of Opole. Something happened behind the front line, they don’t have
local hostages, so you people are it. So you — normally, you know, they took you there,
they took you finery off, they put — put on you paper suits. They filled your mouth with a
—with gypsum, so you couldn’t yell, took you out and hanged you in a marketplace. So
that was it. Said, “Oh gosh, now I got to watch. I have that knife, I have all the jewelry.”
Nothing do it — doing. Went to Vienna, they backed up prison van to the train and two
people with truncheons and two people with machine guns — into, into it, they drove into
—us to the Elizabethpromenade — huge prison, put us in a cell. Next morning, likewise.
Put us in a train. We went through Budejovice, we went as far as Brno in
Czechoslovakia. They put us in old Franciscan monastery that was made into prison. The
walls, they were 12 foot thick walls. That was a fortress. But I see, in quite a big cell,

there were 12 of us and there were another 15 of others. Anyway, there were girls next
door. So we made a hole in that — well, it wasn’t just the big, it was like a plaster wall, so
we made a hole and I laid whole night talking to girls. Bunch of Czech, pretty Czech
girls. They send me a paper, they send me a piece of candy and we talk blue streak all
night. And the next night and the next night and those people who are with me, those
prisoners who are with me said, “My gosh” — those were Bibelforscher™ people, those
were Baptist people. And he said, “We are supposed to be freed when we get to — to
Opole, we’re supposed to be freed.” I said, “Well, count your blessings, if you get freed,
you'll get freed.” Anyway, the fourth day, we’re put on a train, say goodbye to the pretty
girls across the street — across the wall — put us in a train. And we keep watching and I
see the same views. We were going through Vienna and going west again. We got back
to Mauthausen. The place — later on discovered the place where I was supposed to be
disposed of — was overran by the Reds. The Soviet army was there already. And Germans
being so indit— I mean outrigh— Langsam aber Sicher,® slow and great and just exactly
that way, no other way — took us back to the concentration camp.

06:23:41
We came back with a group — big group of prisoners from prisons in Vienna and
elsewhere, probably two or three, 400 of us. There were tables ready, the registering
tables. All the blockschrei—blockschreibers™ were there, including my block secretary
standing — sitting there at tables, you know they write your data, take your document if
you have any and give you a number, give you a bracelet with your number and tell you
where to go. So he was sitting there, he, “Stefan, come on, come on, come on here.” So I
went and I said, “Bujwid.” And he said, “Well, welcome again. Great you made it — great
you made it.” I said, “What do you mean great you made it? I was supposed to be freed.”
He said, “Yeah, you were going to himmel.” And there was a priest, Father Iwanski.
Before I left, he listened to my confession, he gave me absolution and he said, “You are
be freed, with the next three or four days, you’ll be free. And pray for us.” So I ca — later
on I talked to Father Iwanski, I said, “You son of a gun, what do you think it was? Didn’t
you know I was going to by hung?” “Well, you know, I wanted to cheer you up. But I
gave you absolution, so you will go straight to paradise.” So I, “I probably will go to the
deepest hell, what I — for all what I did so far.” Anyway, Mr. Bujwid, “Here’s your
number, here’s your bracelet, go to the showers and go to the barrack. You got — you got
barrack 22, you’re going to my block.” And I looked and I said, “I don’t want this damn
number, this a zugang numbers, this is a new prisoner number. I want my number. I am a
prominente.**” By that time I was a prominent prisoner. If you survive six months, you
become prominent prisoner. And out of those 600 that I came with, in six months there
were 13 of us left, only. So by — by the time — when you became prominente, you have

special consideration. You can even go to SS kitchen after the SS finish and get a dish of
their own soup, with beans and pork in it.

06:25:58

Q: There was kind of a hierarchy in the camp?

A: You beca— you became, you became person who counts. You became a prominent — a
prominent prisoner, because you made it. And most of those who became functionaries in
a camp, you know, if they didn’t go by killing people, they did it by surviving. So he
said, “Shut up. You want be killed? Go to the showers and go to your barrack.” So I put
my arm in there, tucked my ears in, went in. My finery was stripped. My shoe — my
beautiful boots even were taken. I was left with a belt and a pair of holzschuhe® and my
little bundle, which I stuck in a — in a holzschuh. Get out of the shower and was thrown
prison strip — prisoner garb. Went back to the barrack boiling mad and Mr. Bujwid came
and he said, “What’s the matter with you, don’t you know any better? You could get me
killed and yourself killed.” Said, “Yes, but I’m not a prominente any more. Look at that
damn number.” My — I — I will never forget my numbers. If you wake me up presently, in
the middle of the night, I will stand at attention and shout my number. “Hundert-vier,
zwei hundert zwei zwanzig.*”” “104,222.” And the second one was like 40,000 up, it
was, “Hundert zwei und zwanzig, zwei hundert drei and sechzig.**” “122,263.” So he
said, “You know what you had in your documents? You had ‘N and N.” And you know
what else I saw? You had ‘F and S.’” “F and S” was “Frithlingwind.*” It was spring
wind. It was dub — to make double sure that nobody ever knows that you existed. You
disperse like in a spring wind. So he said, “Now, you are free.” Well, I wasn’t free, but
my being taken out to the Politische Abteilung ended. My seat healed. I didn’t get any
more a beating from then on.

Q: So this —

A: I was completely different, new person.

Q: You sort of assumed a new identity.

A: I assumed new identity.

Q: Which was no identity?

A: No, it wa— it was number.

Q: Well, you’re doing just fine.

A: Well, I said forget it, I’m not sick or anything. I’m a tough old son of a gun.

Q: They didn’t tattoo you?

A: No. They did not tattoo in Mauthausen, no.

Q: Okay.

A: Only Auschwitz.

Q: Just Auschwitz.

A: Yeah, only Auschwitz.

Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We’re outside
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is being conducted by Katie Davis and this is
tape number seven. I wanted to ask you about the man you were just describing, who sort
of had a position at the camp and who was giving you advice on your situation. Was he
Polish?

A: He was Polish. His name was Bujwid. He was from a territory called Zmudz, which is
bi— Lithuania in — in northern Russia. It was a holy Polish Zmudz. The coat of arms was
Saint Michael. And they were Poles from 11th century. He was a prisoner. By surviving
the first six months, also by knowing German very well, he became a block secretary.
Each block had a Blockaltester, block leader, which was in most cases German criminal
and a block secretary who knew German very well, could write and read very well. So he
was it. And it was an important function, even though he didn’t cherish it because he had
to lead — he had to call a lot of people to execution or to bunker or to injection or to gas
chamber or to a — to go on a transport. That was his function — that’s how he survived. If
he wasn’t there, somebody else would have done it. He had to keep the numbers of all
people who had to assist the Rapportfiihrer.”” Every morning you — you lined up outside,
the Rapportfiihrer — SS man came and he counted you. Secretary wrote it down and gave
it to him, he walked out. And a tally was made for the whole camp that had to count just
right, nobody missing. If anybody was missing, they counted 10 times, until they found
everybody. So this secretary was a — was the secretary of the barrack.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 54

Q: And — and what did you think of him or people like that, who essentially were, I guess
taking jobs, in a way, in the concentration camp?

A: Well, in most cases, we were appreciative, because if they were Polish, they could be of
great help to us. Also, yo— they were not killers. Some Kapos were killers. Kapo — Kapos
were group — people who led groups of people to work and to exercise and to kill at will.
But people who — who had functions like block leader, if he didn’t kill, he was all right
and block secretary, most of them did not kill, they were all right. And there was a
secretary over first quarantine, there was a — was a chief secretary of the whole —
Fiihrerschreiber,”' secretary of the whole camp. They had positions. The camp inside, ran
itself. Let me have a drink of water.

A: Well, I’m back from a trip.

Q: You were asking about the, the guy who’s — The guy, okay.

A: The guy, yes.

Q: Okay. I think — I think actually, I think you answered that, so—

A: Yes. So I was — I was back on his — in his barrack—

Q: Oh right, okay.

A: And that was a time that evacuations started coming from the east. When the eastern
front approached, they would evacuate camps and push the prisoners in, killing most
along the way. Those who could not walk would be killed and those who could walk. So
Mauthausen became greatly overcrowded. So, like my barrack, instead of having 120
people, had 700. Half of the people slept inside, sitting one again — against each other, for
half a night and then they would get out of a window and the people who are standing
outdoors, would get in at 12 o’clock and sit on the floor to be warm and to sleep until
morning.

07:05:02

Q: You did this too?

*! Chief clerk (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 55

A: Oh, of course, yes. And it was a time when I — when I met Victor Frankl. You heard of
Victor Frankl? He was a Jew from Vienna. He just died about a year ago, he was in his
upper 90’s. He was a great man, he was a psychoanalyst. If you ever see a little book
called my — Man’s Search for Meaning, it was translated into English, many of his books
were translated, he was a psychoanalyst. And he — when he came to Mauthausen, I don’t
know if — if he came from Auschwitz or elsewhere, he was just on his last leg. He lost his
spoon, he lost his dish and with those two, you were dead. But he had a big bundle of
papers. And we met, he somehow plopped next to me and — and he said, “Nu, who are
you?” “Oh, I am Polish.” “Oh, I am Jew from Vienna. And what do you do in your life?”
I said, “I did nothing, I was a student and I was doing some little work after that — before
the Germans caught me. What did you do?” “Well, I was a doctor and I’m a doctor of
psychology.” And I said, “Where’s your spoon?” “Oh, I lost it.” “Where’s your dish?”
“Oh, I lost it.” I said, “Man, you dead, because you won’t get your soup, you won’t get
anything to eat with.” And if you try to catch some — some servers would give it into your
hat, but most of them wouldn’t. They would just take you aside and kill you. Anyway,
found him soup spoon and found him dish and we became friends. And he was great. For
next few days we just talked and every time we felt bad, it was just — end was coming,
you know, people are being taken to gas chamber and places. He’s a — he said, “Oh, sit
down here, let’s talk.” So we talk blue streak and we got cheered up. He developed a—a
special kind of psychotherapy call — called logotherapy. And he’s went talking on — on —
talking tours through United States many times. One time he came in 1970’s, late 70’s
and we couldn’t get together, but I phoned him at Coffman Union at the University here
and he called me back at work and then he talk — we — he phoned at night and we talked
for about three hours, from about 12 until 3:30. Said, “Well, I got to go, my train is — my
plane is leaving shortly.” So we said, “Auf wiedersehen” and then — anyway, he
survived, but when — I never thought he would make it, but he did. He stayed in
Mauthausen to the very — time of liberation. But, my case, again, I was fished out after a
few — in a few days after the great crowds came and I was transported to Gusen Zwei,
which was a walking distance. Gusen Eins” was about two mi- two kilometers, Gusen
Zwei was about five kilometers, so we walked. There were about 5,000 of us walked that
day. We were gather at the nightfall. We were — our clothes was taken, only belt and
shoes were left on us. Our clothes was taken to be disinfected. We went to showers,
which were cold at that time. We were put outside and we stayed until about four a.m. I
was still quite nimble and quite healthy. I got in the middle of a group. My head kind of
froze, but at morning we found about 500 people who were dead, out of 5,000. This is
only 10 percent.

07:09:16

Q: But... tell us what that was like to — to spend the night and have people dropping around
you, dying.

°° Gusen I
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 56

A: Yes, well, you become numb. You become cold, you beco— you hurt. Then all of a
sudden you become numb, you don’t hurt any more. You’re not even cold any more. You
become kind of a frozen stick. And Gusen Zwei was the worst camp you ever heard of.
Normally, it had 50,000 prisoners and by the end of a week would be 45,000. Every week
5,000 prisoners came, sometime 10,000. And it never went above 50. Never went about
40. In a week would be 40. About — attrition ration was about 20 percent a week. Was a
horrible work, we worked digging tunnels under mountain. The tunnels were buil— dug
especially to put armament industries in them. They already built tanks. They built
Messerschmitt — Messerschmitt planes. And I think they built also rocket planes that they
used — I mean, the Vau-Eins,”’ Vau-Eins, Vau-Zwei,”* to bomb England. But I’m not sure
of that. But I knew they built Messerschmitts. But I was on a crew that was digging the
tunnel, digging with a — straight ahead of you, in a kind of a softish stone, with a air drill.
And a person as strong as he is, or he is, could stand about four days. After four days you
broke down. Well, I stood it for about seven days and I was given a shovel to shovel
because I couldn’t lift it any more. And I had a Yugoslavian friend — Janko — Janko, I
can’t remember his last name. He lasted 27 days drilling. The drill weighed probably 35 -
40, maybe 50 pounds, straight into the wall, drilling. Then he dropped dead. Just dropped
the drill and dropped. By the time we turn him over, he was dead. Yeah, he was a —
Yugoslavians and especially Albanian. Albanian people are the tough son of a guns.
Albanian man can swear for 15 minutes and never repeat himself. And if you translate
some of the swearing, your hair will stand on end. They’re tougher than Polacks, they’re
tougher than Russians. Even tougher than Yugoslavians.

07:12:10

Q: What were they giving you to eat at this point? Were you getting—

A: We had cup — we got cup of tea, it was birch leaves, or whatever it was, in the morning,
nothing else. Sometime there was some milk. It was like a — like a cereal, boiled. Like
maybe a handful of cereal to 10 gallons of water. It was slightly sweetish, I think they
had some — beet marmalade mixed in it, and a cup of tea. At noon, you got a half a gallon
of soup that had practically nothing in it and a small slice of bread. At night you got a
pound of bread for either seven or eight or 10 people and a — another cup of tea. It was
supposed to be 800 calories, but by the time it did get to you, it was no more than about
four or 500. One does — if one did not organize, one did not last long.

Q: What — what do you mean by that?

A: I was lucky. I had a Russian friend who was a thief. He can steal anything out of
anyplace. When the allotment of cigarettes came to a block to be given to the
functionaries and it was parceled out, he would always steal of — steal a carton of

°3-V-1 (German)

4-2 (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 57
cigarettes and nobody ever could catch him. He was a Rostovskiy urka.” He was a
specialist from Rostov. He said, “When I was 10 years old, Ya khodil po karmenam,” I
walked in — he walked into people’s pockets.” He was a pickpocket. He could steal
anything off anybody. So he shared his cigarettes with me. Cigarette were the high, hard
currency. For one-fourth of a cigarette, you got portion of bread. For one-eighth of a
cigarette, you got a dish of soup. So when I had an access to something, I shared with
him. To make it short, I had a SS man who didn’t like me, who beat me frequently. He
was a beautiful, young, tall, blonde beast and he had a German Shepherd, young German
Shepherd with him. So one time, I got the sh- German Shepherd in a dark tunnel and of
course I dispose of him, I skinned him. I had him baked in a ba— in the smithy, because I
that time was — I was a—a Laufer,”’ I was a runner. I was running with the drills to the
smithy and back, you know, carrying them back and forth to be sharpened and to be
brought back. So I gave the smith one-fourth of a dog, he baked it for me. Then I shared
another quarter with the people who worked with me and a half of the dog, I brought to
the camp and that three or four of us lived high on the dog for about a week and a half.
Oh, that was an enormous shot in the arm. Course my Russian friend liked the dog so
much, he said, “Stepka, get another one. Get another one.” I said, “Sorry, I cannot catch
and old German Shepherd, this was a young, stupid German Shepherd.”

07:15:41

Q: I see. So, to survive, you couldn’t just accept what they gave you, you had to find that
extra—

A: You had to organize, you had to trade. When I was in Mauthausen, if I worked — when I
worked on a Kanadakommando, sorting the goods, I was able to scrounge a lot of
jewelry, came to the barrack or — got a bundle of American dollars. I could get a beautiful
bottle of booze for 500 dollars. Or I could get a big, five pound sausage for 500 dollars.
And my friends and — and — and — and colleagues, we live high on the hog.

07:16:22

Q: Now, at this time, in this camp that you were at, where you were doing the tunnel
drilling, were people being taken away and executed or gassed at this camp?

A: We had a gas chamber, but I — no, there was a gas chamber in Gusen One, but not Gusen
Zwei. But the mortality ratio was so enormous that — that nothing else was necessary. Of
course the Kapos killed their portion of people every day. We went to camp, I mean went
to work — on the way home we carried five, six, 10 - 15 - 20 people out of a hundred.
Carried them because they were killed at the job. Some dropped dead but most of them

°° Crook from Rostov (Russian)

°6 | walked in pockets (Russian)

°7 Runner (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 58
were killed by the Kapo. Kapo would get a cigarette for every person he killed. If he
were a heavy smoker, he killed a lot of people. Also, there was a Krankenhaus, there was
a hospital and if you went to Krankenhaus, never came back, of course — but some people
did. So from time to time, they would have a — a Krankenhaus had to be disinfected. So
they would take the people from a Krankenhaus and make them walk across the railroad
tracks to another barrack that was empty, kind of a temporary Krankenhaus and keep
them there, and there would be a line of Kapos lined up on each side of the group
walking. Anybody who would walk, they ran a gauntlet. They had ax handles on — or two
by fours, and anybody who did not run, was killed. So I remember once in the first of
February, 1945, they killed that night, 400 sick people out of 700, about 300 only made
it, could run. The rest were killed. I had a friend at that time, he was a Polish
mountaineer. He was a tough son of a — he was just wiry, he was strong. He was
everything. Anyway, he got sick or he — maybe he malinger. So he was sent to the
hospital. He went to hospital, couple nights later comes a Kapo from a hospital and say —
calls my number, so I answer him, and said, “You have a friend in the hospital.” “Yes, I
have a friend in the hospital.” “His — his name is Janko the Goral,”* “John — little Johnny,
the mountaineer.” “Yes.” “Well,” he said, “that window, so he wants you to come and
see him at that window.” So at night I sneaked in — that was not allowed. To get out of a
barrack, going get killed. So I went and I knocked the window, he opened it up and, “Oh,
Stefan, come tomorrow and bring me a big jug of water. I’m so thirsty, there’s not
enough water here. Here.” So he gave me a little bundle. I came back, there were about
seven portions of bread. It was a fortune. Eating an extra portion a day, keep you alive
and up your spirit for at least a week, maybe 14 days. So I brought him some water next
day and I said, “Janko, where did you get all that bread?” “Well, you know, those damn
Muselmans”’.” Muselmans was a name for people who were on their last foot. You
know, they just lay there, they can’t eat, they hold their bread. So when the
Fliegeralarm'”” comes, you know, night, when the lights are out and planes are flying —
lights are all — all the lights are off, he just went from bed to bed and swiped the bread
and lived high on the hog.

07:20:34
And I said, “Janko, but this is un-Christian.” “They are going to die anyway. I’m not
going to —I—I’m not killing them, but they can’t eat. They have bunches of bread sitting
there, they just can’t eat.” So we both — and all my friends in the barrack, lived high on
the hog. And Janko came back, got out of a ba— of a hospital, came back to the barrack
and he was given three days of convalescence. He was staying in the barrack, did not
have to go to work. And the Kapo, day Kapo in the barrack, ask him to do something and
Janko said, “You so and so, get away from me. I’m convalescing, I’m sick.” So the man

°° Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were

near death.

109 Aid-raid alarm (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 59
took his tool and beat Janko to death. I came at night and one of our friends said, “Your
friend is there.” There was a — you know, there was a big, high stone wall between each
barrack and next barrack. And we lined up, you know laid down, it was 10 - 20 - 50
people a day who were dying. So I went. Yes, Janko was still there, laying, his head
bashed in. So I did have his address. I wrote to his family after the war and his sister
answered and she said, “Well, my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because
he argued with her, so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself
charge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp. And please tell me, did he have a
nice casket? How was he buried, did he have a priest?” Janko, with probably 500 others,
next day, was dumped into big wagon, that about 50 prisoners pushed and pulled. They
just had big sides and their wheels were just like the Conestoga wagons in America there,
but bigger. And they pushed and pulled to the first Gusen Eins, where the crematorium
was. Gusen Zwei did not have a crematorium, so that the bodies, probably four or 500 a
day, sometime maybe 1,000 a day were wheeled to Gusen Eins to be cremated.

07:23:07

Q: Were there times when you were afraid?

A: Not really. Became like — became — it became a normal life. It became a very normal life.
You watched not to cross a line, you watched not to overstep your — your — your territory.
You watched. I mean you had to have eyes back there and side here and forward, even
down below. If you — if you saw a SS man coming, you didn’t step off the sidewalk, why,
he just could kill you. If you didn’t step off the sidewalk and take your hat off and clap it
again-against your leg and stood at attention, you could get killed. If he didn’t like your
looks, he could just take a gun and shoot you or else beat you that you would not survive.
On and on and on, and if you did make it, it’s just good luck, holy providence and a good
combination of both of them.

Q: So it’s February or March of 1945, are — are what — are you getting any information from
the rest of the world? Do you have any sense —

A: None. None whatsoever. Well, there were rumors. You know rumors, like in American
army rumors or any place where a lot of people, rumors. There were some people who
listened to radios in a camp, but they shared their information very sparingly. We knew
what was going on. The rumors told that Americans landed. The Russians are coming.
Well, of course you know, all those prisoners coming from the east, consequently the
front line is coming. The Germans are being killed by zillions. Well, great. We hope they
will all ge— will get it. The — then we heard, when the Poles landed in Holland, you know
the Polish parachuters, whole brigade and couple American brigades landed in Holland,
we heard those rumors and it was the gospel truth of course, you could not — I mean, if
you said, “No, it’s not true,” somebody could kill you, probably. Said, “You defeatist,
what do you mean it’s not true? Honest, it’s gospel truth.”
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 60

Q: Did you make good friends there, or —

A: Quite a few. But they didn’t last very long. Either they got transferred or got killed. Most
of them got killed. Only two people that I know survived Gusen Zwei. One was a priest,
one was unfinished priest. Father Iwanski and Father Bruno. Father Iwanski survived. He
survived Gusen, which was not easy to survive. He ended in Canada. I corresponded with
him. He’s dead for last 10 - 15 years. He was an old man that time. You know, he was in
his 40’s, he was old, old man. When he came to camp, said “Hey, how are — old are
you?” “Oh, I’m 29 - 30 - 32.” “Oh my God, you old. Week, two weeks, you are gone.”
You were supposed to be 17 - 18 - 19, you had a chance. If you were over 30, you were
an old man. Father Iwanski was over 40. He was an old man. Father Bruno was an
unfinished priest, he was — we call him unfinished priest. Nie skonczony ksiadz.'°' He
was still in a seminary. He eventually became a priest and he went back to Poland. I
understand he was executed by the Communists.

07:27:01

Q: Did the priests hold any kind of religious services, or —

A: Very secretly.

Q: — counsel you, or —

A: Very — they talked to us.

Q: They talked?

A: When I went on my little trip, Father Iwanski came to talk to me, he was still in
Mauthausen and he talked to me and he blessed me and he listened to my confession.
Later on I —I felt like killing him.

Q: Why?

A: Well, I said, “You should have warned me.” “Warned you? What do — would it do? I
have — I wanted you to feel good for next two or three days.”

Q: But you would have liked to have known?

A: I would have liked to have known, yes. If I would have known, I — I might have made a
greater effort — there wasn’t much chance, but I — I might have tried. I probably would
have killed mysel— got killed for it, but I would have known I didn’t go meekly. And —

Tape #8

08:00:10

Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We are outside of
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape
number eight.

A: Oh my God, eight? He is wasting eight tapes.

Q: Not wasting. This is just — I guess it’s just sort of an observation, that you were saying
you would have liked to have known, that one time when you were being taken off, to
possibly — well, the plan was to hang you. But so much of the war years, you had no idea
what was going to happen next.

A: No, I didn’t. As I said, I was resigned. I expected not to live to be 18 or 20 or 19 or 20,
but I did. And I was very prayerfully, thankful for each day that I lived and tomorrow
will take care of itself. Even at bedtimes, when I expected to be — to be taken to the little
room to be injected — I knew it was coming, but still I said, “Well, I’m still alive today.
Tomorrow will take care of itself.” Especially, I mean I felt very bad one time. There was
a little boy, his name was Henry. He said he was 14, but he looked like he was nine. He
was a — he was a Polish worker, working in Germany, in a factory. Somebody put sand in
a—ina motor. Motor got destroyed, he was blamed for it, sabotage. Sent to Mauthausen.
He lived, for a time, in block 22. Then he was called. And he was — he was just like a
tiny, little bird. He was so skinny, he was so miserable. He just looked like a — like a —
like will of a wisp. And Mr. Bujwid wanted greatly — to help him. So when he —
execution time came, Mr. Bujwid went to the — camp secretary went to Gestapo office
and begged for him, one day. So they postpone it. And the next day — next day he came
his face was bitten up and swollen. He came —

08:02:40

Q: Who’s this?

A: Our secretary. He went next day again and again he had welts on his back and his face
was beaten some more. So the fourth day, a list came — Laufer came running. Laufer was
the runner, you know, as I — pretty young boys were runners, Laufers. They ran between
the camps and delivered messages. So Laufer came with a list and — and said, “Mr.
Bujwid,” I mean, “Herr Bujwid.'” Exekution eintreten, Exekution eintreten.'” Roll up
with execution.” So Mr. Bujwid came to barrack and read the list and I was sure I was
going to be on the list and the little boy was on the list. And he walked out into the front

12 Mr. Bujwid

13 Fall in for execution (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 63
and they got lined up and the Blockaltester, Max, the German criminal who was the block
leader, led them out.... And it was so, so funny, Mr. Bujwid talked with that little Henry.
Oh, they talk blue streak. “Because we both are from the holy Zmudz.” Because the little
boy was from the same territory that Mr. Bujwid was. They say, “We’re holy people, we
believe in God, we hate the damn Communists. We hate those Germans even more
because they’re ungodly creatures. And we are going to survive for ever and ever and
ever.” And the last day, before Henry went to be killed, he said, “Mr. Bujwid, thank
you.” Yeah, he, he knew what was coming.

08:05:06
Anyway, that was still in Mauthausen and that was I wa— then I wa— on our way in —
Gusen Zwei and of course, it — I heard it later on, but it was a good story. A Swedish Red
Cross person, whose name nobody ever found, came to speak to the commander, General
Pohl,” P-o-h-I. And he came to talk to him and General Pohl was complaining, he said,
“See here,” was a telegram or was a letter. “I have an befehl'® here,” I have an order, “to
lead all these people I have left here, about 42,000, into the tunnel. The ends of the
tunnels are already mined to be dynamited and those people will suffocate there, within
in probably one, two hours.” He said, “If it was only telephone order, I probably could
escape not doing it, but is a befehl, it’s a telegram, I had to sign for it. What I am going to
do?” He was not — he was not a very bad person, that man was. Matter of fact, he had a
case in court later on and some of us testified for him. Anyway, when this man left his
office, the document disappeared. The man — and the general was diverted somewhat —
the man swiped it. He borrowed a bicycle from a German guard, then he borrowed a
horse. And the American front line was just beyond Linz. It was probably 30 - 35 - 40
miles. He went across the whole front line on a horse, then — he in tie and suit. Why the
German Ges-— SS didn’t kill him, I don’t have an idea. Did he talked to somebody, I don’t
have an idea. Did he identify himself, I don’t have an idea. He got across, he got as far as
General Patton’ headquarters. And nobody wanted to talk to him, so he bothered
everybody there and eventually somebody did talk to him. So he mentioned that, he
described it. So they said, “Okay, come on in, come on in.” They let him talk to assistant
to Patton. And then Patton came and asked a few questions. And Patton sent five
American tanks. They broke across the front line, they went and went and went. They
came to Gusen Zwei, they took few potshots at the guard towers. The SS people
surrendered. They left tank, I think about five soldiers, to guard those 800 SS, who are
herded into — into — into a big kind of a barn. And the rest of us, who were just barely
moving, because we haven’t gotten anything to eat about four days and my case, I was
flat on my back. I couldn’t even turn over. Then the four tanks went to Mauthausen, five
more miles and sur— and get around, too few — took few potshots at the guard towers.

104 The interviewee later corrected this name to Max Pausch, Kommandant of Gusen II.

15 Order (German)

16 Gen. George Smith Patton
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 64
3,000 SS people surrendered and there was bedlam in Mauthausen. It was not much of a
bedlam in Gusen Zwei because most of us were just about done for.

08:09:07

Q: Take us back a little bit — wa— what was going on the last few days that you had stopped
getting food?

A: They told us there was no food. “We cannot give you anything because there isn’t any.”
Well, it turned out, that the warehouses were full of bread and the bread was — after we
found it after a few days after liberation, it was all moldy by then. There was probably
two, three, four, five tons of bread. They just probably tried to starve us to death. And
many did. Many did. We had an enormous ditch dug out between the Gusen Eins and
Gusen Zwei by American bulldozers, army bulldozers. Just an enormous ditch. And they
took all the Germans from the countryside, with horses and carts and wheelbarrows and
all and they came and picked up all the people, washed up everybody and laid them
evenly, not just dumped them, but laid them evenly in a — in that grave. There are about
18,000 people buried there. And those were the dead for last four or five days, when the
crematorium did not work.

Q: 18,000?

A: About 17 - 18,000. An enormous, enormous — kind of almost like a — like a — like a
riverbank built up high.

Q: Did the Germans know that the Americans were coming?

A: Well, they expected — they, they all knew the front was nearby, but they expect it to be
still fighting there for quite sometime, but this — they just broke through. They said, “Oh
my God, the armies are coming. “Amerikaner, Amerikaner — run!” And the SS of course,
just surrendered and the Commander Ziereis'”” was a horrible man — of Mauthausen. He
was — people testified and — against him and he was hanged, later on. But General Pohl of
Mau-— of Gusen Zwei, was exonerated.

Q: Think back to that day and — you said you were laying in bed, but did — what did it sound
like when the Americans —

A: It was kind of a bedlam — it was a bedlam and it was a — Americans really came, you
know — really came. It was about two days later that the front moved, Americans came.
They just came in, walking around. Taking lot of pictures and they came to my — to my
barrack and they looked up and — and one of them spoke German, “Kommen Sie da,

'°7 Franz Ziereis
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 65
kommen Sie da.!°*” And I said, “I can’t move. I can’t even turn over.” “Ja, wir helfen
dich — wir helfen — wir helfen dich.'” We'll help you. Came with a stretcher and a
couple people and they pull me off. They lay me in a stretcher and somebody came with a
pail of water, they washed me off. I was — I was shitty and — and stinking, and all that and
they covered me up with a German army overcoat. Took me to Gusen Eins and there was
a little hospital made there and were given little milk — milk with — mixed with water and
kind of a gruel, that you give to babies, for a few days. Eventually, we started eating
food. And people who were in — who got hold of a solid food, like American were tossing
cans of Spam — and Spam was the heavenly food. Oh my God. Spam was it. I still can
close my eyes and I can taste that beautiful American Spam. So somebody would eat it,
would not share it with somebody else and he would die, immediately, on the spot. Could
not — could not take it.

08:13:15

Q: So you were pretty sick. What was the reaction of the Americans who saw you — who ca
—who came by your bunk and saw you?

A: Well, there were so many of us, they were just flabbergasted. They kept us there and they
took us some, on — in trucks, to hospital in Bamberg, which was couple hundred miles
west, into West Germany. And I was in a Stadtischer Hospital,''° the state hospital for
about four, five, six months there. I had — well, I was down to 72 pounds, had a—I had a
bad case of tuberculosis. And my lungs were collecting liquid, especially my left lung. So
I got shots. I got shots, it was the 10 cubic centimeters lime — lime shots. Know lime, like
the — used for building? Calcium — calcium shots. Calcium shots. And when you get the
shot, you get hot from your tip of your toe — fingers to tippy toes and to your head, you
just get pleasantly hot. And that was supposed to sh— to dry up that liquid in your lungs.
And after a few weeks, when a nurse was coming with a needle, my veins went south.
She would jab and jab and jab and she could not find a vein. She said, “Just don’t look
when I come. I don’t want you to see, because your veins disappear.” My both arms were
just like — like I was a heavy addict to God knows what. But it didn’t dry it. It didn’t dry,
they had to make a puncture in the back and pump it out. And they couldn’t put me
under, because I would never wake up. So two big men, just like those two, big clunks
held me and the doctor went back and he made — punctured my back and he pumped, oh
probably gallon and a half of horrible liquid. And he said — the doctor said, “Well, if
you’re lucky, this is it. If you’re not lucky, you have to pump it every six months for the
rest of your days. Of course, if are still unlucky, you die of TB, well, you’ll be dead.” I
was lucky. I didn’t die of TB and I did not have to ever have it pumped again, except that
I have two big stones on the bottom of my lungs, because the calcium goes all the
organism and collects in your lungs and settles on the bottom. Occasionally when I have

"° Municipal hospital (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 66
cold, when I cough, little grainy stuff, I do cough out. Doesn’t bother me any. Except I go
to x-ray. When I first came to x-ray, he says, the doctor — technician looked, call the
doctor and doctor said, “What is that?” And I said, “What is what?” “What is that on
bottom of your lungs?” I said, “Calcium.” “Calcium? How come calcium?” Said, “Well, I
was given about 310 cubic centimeters as injections of calcium to dry up my wet
pleurisy, they called it, Pleuritism Exudative''’ in Latin — my wet pleurisy.” “Oh, they
did that?” “Yes, they did that.” “Did it dry out?” “No.”

08:17:00

Q: Did you feel — I mean, could you comprehend that the war is over? Did you feel safe
again?

A: I felt safe.

Q: Did you feel like it was really over?

A: And I felt safe and I felt on the top of a cloud. It’s unbelievable, but when you have
nothing, you know, you are dirty, you are starving, you have completely nothing and you
are in prison, the freedom is so sweet. When we went to work, there was a train going
over the viaduct and you saw the German people standing in the windows and smiling,
you know. Well dressed, well-fed, just smiling, you said, “Oh my God, how free those
people are.” They were not, I mean, they were under Nazis men, all that, but “how free
these people are.” And frequently when you are in a life, you are quite well off
sometimes and oh, my God, you know how many people commit suicide because being
unhappy temporarily. Nobody ever committed suicide there. He was Muselman, he went
to gas tomorrow morning, he did not commit sui— suicide today. Well, there were
incidents where people went against the wire and got themselves elec-electrocuted. But
you never became despondent. You also — you n— you need that — you e — never caught a
cold. I had never seen a person in Siberia — I have never seen a person in a concentration
camp to catch a cold. Nobody ever caught the common cold, ever. They are just too
tough to catch a cold. When you get to be a civilian, you become sissy, you catch any
cold that comes along.

Q: Now, when you got out, were you able to contact your family at all?

A: No. For about six months I couldn’t.

Q: Why not?

A: There was no connection.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 67

Q: Okay.

A: No correspondence, nothing, between West Germany and Poland, they were damn
Soviets on the way. About six months later, I registered with the Swedish Red Cross and
the Swedish Red Cross notified them and about a year later, we started writing back and
forth, so they knew that I was still alive and — alive and kicking and not too bad. Of
course I was still in a — in a sanatorium.

Q: In — the first place you went to the hospital was in —

A: In Bamberg.

Q: the U.S. —

A: Bamberg

Q: — occupied Germany?

A: I’m sorry. It was in U.S. occupied Austria.

Q: Austria, okay.

A: In Gusen Eins, there was a kind of a hospital or camp hospital. In a few days, only — later
on, they took us to Bamberg, to a real hospital. It was a good, old German hospital and —

Q: And how did you feel about being treated by Germans?

A: Great. The Schwesters'!? — I mean all people who took care of you are nuns. The
Schwesters are all nuns. All nurses in Germany at that time were nuns. There some nurse
helper — nurse helpers who were ladies, women, civilian girls, but all German nurses
were Schwesters. Oh yeah, then we had some great Schwesters. I still have a rosary that
one gave me. Yeah, Sister Urszula gave me rosary, I still have it.

08:20:33

Q: So when was it determined that you would need to go for further rest?

A: Well, after being in the hospital, they said, “Well, you are not well to go into a camp, you
have to go to sanatorium because your tuberculosis — it’s not spreaded — spreading, it’s
arresting — it’s arrested, but you have to have rest.” So I went to Erholungsheim!" — rest

home, which is a beautiful SchloB'"* ona top of a mount — on the top — top of a hill, next
to forest, with a big garden. And it was a Schlof8, it was a castle that belonged to a
German Jewish family. They had a David — David star in their — in their coat of arms.
When the Hitler’s came, they all were arrested and packed to concentration camps and I
understand never came back.

Q: So what was it like when you got there?

A: Well, we were assigned rooms — either one or two people to a room, you stayed a lot in
bed. The food was quite good, provided by the German — by the Germans and — and
Swiss Cross and American army, mostly. We’d get American PX packages, with a little
canned food and a beautiful piece of chocolate. I was crazy about chocolate. When I got
my package, there was probably about four ounces of chocolate, I inhaled it. One time
the chocolate was moldy in those packages, so I traded with everybody who want to
dispose of it. I traded everything I had — I had — oh my God, I don’t know how many
blocks of chocolate I had —I ate myself sick. For next six weeks, I couldn’t look
chocolate in the face. It was very moldy. The German doctor — actually it was a French
lady doctor, she thought I was get blood — I mean food poisoning, she hovered over me
constantly. It was a beautiful, little French girl. I almost, I almost married her. Yeah, she
— we, we became very friendly and she took me to see her family, we drove all the way to
Versailles, stay there, came back. Of course nothing came out of it, I was just a
dilapidated little old prisoner and she was a beautiful young lady, just out of medical
school. But was great when it lasted. Oh, she was fun to be with.

08:23:09

Q: Boy, it sounds like you were starting to begin to take joy in normal things like —

A: Well, of course —

Q: — chocolate and dating and —

A: Of course, I me — I mean every day was a new day and you are free. You are not going to
get to be — get your — shot or go to a gas chamber. In Mauthausen, every 10 days, one
block was gassed. You went to showers, you went in tiptoe — you went to showers every
10 days. You went tiptoeing, your whole block, you know, 400 - 600 people — and there
was a deathly silence. You could not hear people breathe. And everybody was watching
the shower heads. You got a little piece of soap. When the water came, it was a bedlam.
Jumping, yelling, shouting, laughing, hugging one another, because sometime, instead of
the water, those little red flaps came open, Zyklon B''* poured in — those little blue

"S Zyclon B (German); hydrogen cyanide.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 69
granules poured in, by gallons. Then your goose was cooked. Seventeen minutes, you
were done for.

Q: So you knew what happened in — in — I mean it was no secret at that point?

A: Oh no, that was no secret.

Q: Yeah.

A: When you went — and you never know which — you never knew which barrack was going
to happen to. So you went — you apprehensive, when you got out, you say, “Whee, I’m
going to live next 10 days. At least next 10 days.”

Q: And you told me before that sometimes you were forced to actually clean up after that.

A: Yes. Yes, I was under special — special barrack, so when they needed extra help when
extra — lot of people came, they took a crew of 10 - 20 - 50 people and we had to go
transport the bodies to the cool chamber. The cool chamber, it was kind of a underground
tunnel and a little push railroad. We loaded up the bodies on the top of this little flatcars
and got into crematorium — in the cool chamber next to it. The cool chamber too — could
take about 2,000 people — bodies. Because sometime they couldn’t catch up, burning.

Q: I mean how do you — what do you say to yourself to make yourself do something like
that?

A: Well, you went willingly, you got an extra bowl of soup. You abhorred it, but you went.
You got big dish of SS soup. Peas or beans with pork in it. Oh my God, that was a
heaven. As I said, your life became every day life — normal, every day life. And whatever
happened was normal for that time and place.

08:26:15

Q: In the first few days of your liberation, think about what were the things that — that were
normally normal, but you weren’t used to any more. Did you have any experiences, you
know that —

A: It was just — it was just like being a cloud nine. Laying in a clean bed and being clean and
being — people come and feed you. An American would come and stand by my bed. And
he said, “You cannot eat, can you?” “Well, I can, kind of.” So he would take a spoon....
Yes, it was a great feeling.

Tape #9

09:00:07

Q: It is April 8, 1998. We’re outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is being
conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number nine. So you’re in the sanatorium and
you’re beginning to get your strength back. What kind of thoughts are you having about
your future?

A: Not much of it. By the time I became well, I knew that Poland became Communist and
the part of the Polish underground I was in was fighting both the Germans and the
Communists. As we said, “They are coming, who do you shoot first?” We said, “Pleasure
before duty, shoot the Russians first.” And I knew they were looking for me. I felt they
were looking for me. I discover later on they were. Out of the original 17 — 20, five of us
survived. I was arrested by the Germans and was sent away. The four boys survived.
About a year later, they were asked to a big party by the local Russian army people,
because they discovered what we did and especially what we did for them. They had a
big party. They drank and ate for three days and three nights, they were given Stalin
Cross. They were given Pobieda Medal,''® Russian victory medal. They were given
Polish Virtuti Militari, third class. They were given 17,000 rubles each. And fourth day,
were packed on a — put on a train and sent to Siberia. Said, “People like you, we
appreciate what you did for us, but we don’t want you now here.” And two of those four
boys — were two that were of — with me from the very beginning. From the very — my
first seven — 17 and there was Icek number one, Icek number two. Isaac number one,
Isaac number two. They were both Jewish boys. And they led a charmed life. I knew I
was probably God’s chosen, maybe son of God — sometime I felt I was God, almost.
Because everybody else killed right and left, mutilated, I am still alive. I got few — hit
few times, but it was nothing. But I always look at those two and said, “My — you two are
freaks. How come you still alive?” “Well, if you want to kill us, go ahead.” They never
came back. The other two came back from Soviet Russia, these two never came back.

09:03:10

Q: Now, I didn’t know that two of the boys in your unit were Jewish.

A: Yes, they were Jewish, yes.

Q: Interesting.

"6 Victory Medal (Russian)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 72

A: We had probably more who did not identify themselves. And I remember some of the
names of people. But none of our names were names. We did not tell our own names. My
c —my name was not Czyzewski, my name was Grot.!”

Q: Can you spell that?

A: G-r-o-t.

Q: Okay.

A: Spear point.

Q: Cause I had read in some of the history books, that some of the Polish underground didn’t
want to fight with the Jewish underground.

A: Many didn’t — some didn’t — many didn’t. The A.I. — A.L., Armia Ludowa, the
Communists did accept Jews. Actually, the whole army accept many Jews. My part did
not accept many Jews, but we had quite a few. We had quite a few and those two were
the best.

Q: So, Icek and Icek did not come back?

A: Icek and Icek didn’t come back. Icek Pierwszy, Icek Drugi never come back. I don’t even
know their last names. Never learned.

Q: But the two other ones did?

A: Those two other ones survived and came back.

Q: Did you ever meet up with them again?

A: No. They refused to write to me. I had a third hand information from them. One is still
alive, I think. One is dead. Was — wa- they said, “Damn you, it was your fault.”

Q: How so?

A: Well, they served with me. You cannot, you cannot guess people’s feelings. They just felt
that way, it was my fault. But — but I did not — we did not have people who had to be with
me. Those people all volunteers. And we had them coming through the doors and
windows. When we lost a person or two or three, we got 10 who wanted to be. Yeah,
because they wanted to be active.

Q: How did your family, when they found out — well, I guess they knew what you were
doing — they found out you had survived.

A: They knew I wasn’t around. We never talked much. I came for a visit and say, “Well, I
can visit for a while, I have to be on the run.” They knew I was being looked after — I
mean searched for. The Schutzpolizei would come sometime and beat my — beat up my
father and ask for me. And he said, “I don’t know. You came looking for him one time,
he, he ran away and he probably is dead. Never heard from him again. Matter of fact — as
a matter fact, I think you — you took him to Germany. He worked — he wrote few letters
from a place he worked in Germany, then he disappeared.”

09:06:15

Q: Your father must have been proud of you.

A: I don’t know. I don’t know. He always ran me down. Then one time, he was sitting on a
fence at nigh — in the evening, with the neighbors. He was bragging about me. And I
knew that he was not really — didn’t think I was wimp or nothing or next to nothing. But
he always told me, “Oh, come on, you’re so clumsy. Can’t you do this, can’t you do that?
Get on the ball.”

Q: Did you go back to Lesnogora after the war?

A: Never been — never went back yet. I think I have about one more person I’m waiting to —
to kick the bucket. Then I go and spit on his grave.

Q: Who is that?

A: Okay, somebody who is very unsavory, who is a traitor. Also, I have a good reason now
to go to — to go back. I had a friend whose name was Stefan, his last name was Wojtyla
and if you know the connotation, you know John Paul Two, his last name is Wojtyla.|'®
Stefan Wojtyla was my neighbor, was my friend, went to school together. He did not
want to join. When the Soviets came, he joined immediately.

Q: Are you saying you were friends with the Pope?

A: No, no, no.

Q: Okay.

A: I was friend with Stefan Wojtyla.

"8 Karol Wojtyla
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 74

Q: Sorry. Okay, okay, okay.

A: Stefan Wojtyla has the same name as the Pope.

Q: Name, okay.

A: They are from different part of the country, they’re no relation, most likely. Stefan
Wojtyla joined the Communist party, he was sent for training to Soviet Russia, he came
back in 1949 or 1950. He joined Polish army. He became a law officer. He became, last
time — he used to write to me, say “Stefan, come back. Your were shedding blood, you
were fighting. You will get your rewards here.” So we wrote back and forth and I
discovered that Stefan Wojtyla arrested at least dozen of my people and at least eight
were put against the wall and shot without trial. In 1973, he became a persecutor general
of the Polish armed forces and was the last time he wrote to me, because I wrote him that,
“You dirty, damn Communist. Why did you have to do that?” So he wrote back, “I
haven’t done anything, I helped a lot of people, I helped a lot of people.” And I wrote
him, “Do you want a feather in your hat? You want me to come back and you put me
against the wall?” So he wrote, “I would never do that to you, you were my friend
always, you always will be my friend. But I am becoming the prosecutor general of the
Polish armed forces and I cannot write you to — to you any more. But I promise you that
— your folder, that is about three inches thick, is going to disappear when I get my
position. Nobody’s going to see it again.” And my sisters, when they came — they came
here, said, “Yes, he came for a visit, many times,” and the times were hard in Poland, so
sh— they said that he brought always some very exquisite food. He always brought a
bottle of champagne and — with a lunch with him and he said, “I never will forget what
you did for me.” He said, ““When I was a kid, and we were dirt poor, when Stefan and I
were going to school in the morning, I would sneaked into your house early and your
mother always would give me a good breakfast with Stefan. And then we walked our
three kilometers to school.” He said, “I’ll never forget that. And you can write Stefan that
I would never hurt him.” Anyway, when I go back, I will spit —

09:10:30

Q: On his grave?

A: Well, probably not. I should be Christian and forgive him. But I can not forget. Just like
that — there’s a little German saying that says, “Orte und Zeiten der Schrecken die wir
niemals vergessen werden.''”” “The times and places of horror, we should never forget.”
Especially this day and age. You know, you talk to young people — I spoke to about 110
young people in a middle school about two weeks ago. And they had a course on
Holocaust, they wanted to know what was going on. They don’t know who Hitler was.
They heard little of Stalin, they don’t remember who Roosevelt was. They learn little

"° The places and times of terror should never be forgotten. (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 75
about the Holocaust. They were living — reading Elie Wiesel, the book — little book,
Night. They were just about few pages gone and they wanted to ask many questions and I
told them little story. So I frequently go and talk to group — various groups of people,
willingly, and few of us that are still alive should not forget. And it seems like your
people with the museum there and whatever information you impart to people must have
some influence, because a lot of schools, even grade schools, have a special course every
year on the Holocaust. And as far as I know, almost all the middle schools here,
especially the religious schools, Catholic and Lutheran schools, do have it too.

Q: So you — you — you didn’t want to go back, because it was Communist and so —

A: Well, I—1-I could not go.

Q: You couldn’t go, right.

A: Because those people are — my sisters wrote me in 1955, I think and said, “Well, we
would like to see you, but if you come, you may end in a piaskowo.'*°” Piaskowo is a
cemetery — is a sandy hill. Said, “Because many people like you are being taken out.” I
had two little relatives, they were two girls my age. They were actually my nieces but I —
they were my age. In 1947, they were arrested, they were mistreated, they were sent to
Jai— to prison for 10, 15, 20 years. They were exonerated in 1960, released and they even
were allowed to live in Warsaw, which was a great privilege. They’re both dead. They
didn’t survive very long.

09:13:54

Q: Your, your parents survived the war?

A: My father survived. My — my mother was dead by then. My mother was a war, war
casualty. She had a baby and all doctors were arrested and sent to concentration camps.
She had a very child — difficult childbirth and she died in childbirth at 41.

Q: Died?

A: Yes. But those two girls in question, they were couriers for our underground. They
carried mostly explosives on the train. They’d have two huge suitcases of explosives, get
on the train, they spoke little German. They’re pretty young girls. Well, frequently they
would get into a German car — a bunch of German soldiers, officers had a special car, so
they’re, “Madchen, madchen, kommen Sie hier.!7!” So they would came with the big
suitcase that the German would pick up the suitcase, put it up on the upper. Because there
were controls frequently, they would stop a train and search and contraband like food, the

20 Sandy hill (Polish); colloquially “cemetary.”

ig Girls, girls, come here! (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 76
so-called black market, which was a free market, people training would be stole — taken
away from people. So if you are pretty girl and you carry that, Germans invited you, took
your bundle there and nobody could come and search you. And they would come to
Warsaw and said, “auf wiedersehen” and “danke schén” and went blissfully their own
way with four big suitcases, carrying enough stuff to blow up four — four or five trains.
But the Communists got them. They said, “But we helped you.” “Well, helpers like you
we don’t need any more.” Just like with my four boys. “Helpers like you we don’t need
any more.”

09:15:59
And mainly, we were helpers in one aspect. In 1943, in summer, a Communist young
man, slightly older than I, came and talk — talked. He said, “Stefan, we need to blow up
something and I know that you can do it.” I said, “You’re a dirty Communist. I wouldn’t
bend my finger to do anything for you.” “But you know, you really got to help us. You
really got to help us.” So I talked to my commander and my commander said, “Oh, you
stupid so and so. Go help them? If you go and lose your behind, it will serve you well
because you lost your head already.” But he reconsidered. Few days later he came and
said, “Yes, you can go and help them. I talked — we talked.” So they provided me with
two — well, they gave me two of my boys and myself and a load of explosives. And
provided us with a German chauffeur. German chauffeur who was carrying a truckload of
arm — war material to a certain spot. And we’re going to that spot. It was kind of an army
filled depot. There were a lot of explosives there and then tanks and aircraft bombs and
God knows what else. So he left us out in the forest. He went and delivered the stuff and
then came back and he was going to wait for us in the forest. And I was told, “You send
one boy, if he doesn’t make it, send a second one. Don’t go yourself, because if you go,
you get court martialed when you get back.” So one of my boys went in, he went under
the first wire and had a little shovel, dug out. Then he went to a second wire and a dog
got him. And the guards, the SS guards came in and shot him. And well, he didn’t suffer
because they shot what he had with him and he just gro— got blown up to smithereens. So
then I said, “Well, your turn.” He said, “No, I’m not going.” I said, “But you have to, you
swore.” “You can shoot me, I’m not going. I’m not going to help those son of a bitches
against those son of a bitches.” So I said, “Well, you don’t have much choice, do we? I
have to shoot you.” “Well, go ahead and shoot me. You’re my friend. I would rather be —
be shot by a friend than — then relative.” So I said, “Well,” I said, “I’m going to try, but
be sure when we come back, don’t you ever tell.” Said, “Ill save my life, I won’t tell.”

09:19:11
So I went — I went to the first place, I went to a second place, there was still stuff around.
It was muddy also, but was quite muddy from the person who blew up. And a dog came
and for quite sometime — I don’t know if I had — it’s like I had affinity with dogs.
Actually when we walked — my group walked to the village and I was with them, not a
single dog would bark. And a bunch of dogs would fo— I would go — walk behind and a
bunch of dogs would follow me and squeal — wanted to be petted. So the dog came and
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 77
he squealed and I petted him and he raised his — his — his leg and sprayed me from head
to toe. | was so mad at that dog. I said, “If that was elsewhere, I would show you what is
what.” And the guards came by and the dog followed them and I was right at their feet
there. They never looked. So I scrambled in — I walked in. I had — I always ruled by 17, I
had — my lucky 17. So I went for my 17 charges, put them here and there. Then I got out
the same way, I watched the guards when they just passed. I got from — was a kind of a
half truck standing nearby, got from behind it. Scrambled under one wire and a second
wire and ran like hell. Got to my boy, grabbed him and we both ran like hell. We got to
the forest. Probably was a good kilometer, was like three-fourths of a mile. He started the
truck, we drove. We drove like hell for about 10 - 15 minutes and it blew up. The first
explosion blew up all the windows in the truck, back and front. And then it blew and it
blew and it blew and it blew. It was just like an atomic f—bomb fireworks. They were
preparing pa — putsch on Moscow and the Russians — and the Russian under — Soviet
underground wanted badly to demolish this. So that’s why my boys, after the war were
invited to the big party. “You did for us, you did for us, but now we don’t need you any
more. Also, people like you we don’t need here. Out you go.” And they asked about me
and they said, “The Germans got him, probably killed him.”

09:21:55

Q: It’s interesting, I hear more bitterness in your voice about that than I have heard about
other things.

A: Well, yes. I think we — I thought we did them, did them a favor. I was sorry to have done
it, but was fun to blow up that thing. Oh my God, it was just like a — like a Easter
Monday — like Easter Sunday. You should see those explosions, sky high, flying in every
direction. Oh, it was a blow out. I was practically intoxicated watching it. But we were
repaid and my friend Stefan Wojtyla mentioned it. He said, “They would never do
anything to you.” So later on I wrote to somebody, “Ask Stefan what happened to my
four boys.” Later on he said, talked to some, “It was an aberration.” Anyway, he went to
his rewards. I don’t know, maybe he — maybe he became a good Christian and is happy in
paradise, playing the lyre. But I kind of suspect that the good Lucifer is poking him with
a fork now, 1a-bas.!””

Q: You lived in the — tell us a little bit about the displaced person’s camps. When you got
better —

A: Yes, when I — when I recei— became better, I was in a— a Hohenfels, then I was in Lohr,
which was not really — it was like a hospital, it was called sanatorium. Then I became
better and I went — was sent to Aschaffenburg, Jager Kaserne,'*’ a displaced person
camp. And I kind of convalesced there for a short while. Then I work in the kitchen for a

22 There (French)

3 Barrack (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 78
time and I became an accountant in the kitchen. Well, the Jager Kaserne was disbanded,
we went to a da — different Kaserne, closer to Aschaffenburg, within a city, stay there for
a time. Then I worked as a courier there, for a time, between those three camps. There
was Ukrainian camp and two Polish camps. Then we were se — to — moved again to a
camp, Wildflecken, which is close to Schweinfurt in Bavaria. It was enormous German
army camp. I think it was the ski troops that were trained there. Enormous, there were
probably 15 - 20,000 refugees there. By that time I was — for a time I was stenographer
for the police force and then became a detective and worked there for the duration as a
detective until I left in 1949 for America.

Q: What did you investigate?

A: Local crimes, there were some murders, there were some rapes, there were some so
called sui— faked up suicides — murders that looked like suicides. There were malpractice,
medical malpractice. I had one medical malpractice where a lady went to have a appendix
taken and the doctor forgot to tie one blood vessel and she bled to death, into her
abdomen. And some interesting cases. Shoot — shoot-outs with gangs occasion, but very
seldom.

09:25:21

Q: Gangs?

A: Well, there were Polish gangs that went — black market operators mostly. Well, if for
instance, we'd go to a farm and they would need a cow, they put boots on a cow legs and
lead the cow to the camp and lead the cow to the fourth floor to the attic and slaughter it
and have a lot of meat to sell. It was all kind of shenanigans going on. And from time to
time I would make a document for somebody. See, people who escaped from across —
from there — behind Iron Curtain, some want — some had a hard time documenting
themselves. So when I felt that somebody was not guilty of anything and worthy, more or
less, I would — I was specialist in sacram— sac— document forging. When I was still in
Polish underground, I went through a crash course and worked for sometime in the so
called “psychological warfare.” Kind of got to — little vacation from my group. From a
fighting group. So I could make documents. I can make you a document. I can make a
stamp. I can forge your signature or your signature and your signature, if I — if I want to —
if I practice long enough.

09:26:42

Q: There’s a thread here, it’s like you’re very good at investigating and underground work
and being, I think probably really analytical in assessing situations and being able to
figure out how to handle them.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 79

A: That’s why I’m still alive, I think. Of course, holy providence had something to do with
it, but most of the time I avoided getting killed. I got beaten — L, I got almost finished off
one time, when I worked in a tunnel. I had a Kapo who was a Czech, he hated Poles and
he hated me specially. “You shitty little Polack.” He would beat me up and do things to
me. So, one time I was working up — up there and he was passing by and I took the
railroad tie and I put — put it down on him. Got him hit quite badly. Anyway, I was very
sympathetic when I later on saw him. “Oh, Gabriel you get hurt? Oh, you poor thing,
what happened to you?” He said, “Some son of a bitch tossed a railroad tie on me.”
Anyway poor Gabriel got so bad that he lost his Kapo job and he got the shits and if you
got those, you got loose stomach in a camp, you are done. So, I even went and burned my
portion of bread for two days and fed it to him. Cause if you got very loose stomach,
which was a killing thing, three days you are done — if you had enough bread and charred
it and ate it, it would stop it. So I fed the poor Gabriel with my own bread and every time
I turn around, I felt like spitting in my face, helping that old son of a gun. I mean he was
old, he was 31, but he was old in comparison, I mean he was. And I don’t even know if
he survived or not because I was transferred to a different barrack and he stayed in the
same barrack. I don’t know if he made it or not. That old Gabriel, Angel Gabriel, he was
not. I still got a little scar, he one time chopped me with a — with a shovel, just swung the
shovel and cut me right over my forehead.

Q: How did you have compassion for him?

[Technical conversation]

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We are outside of
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape 10.
How — how did you have compassion for someone like the Czech Kapo?

A: I don’t know. I felt sorry for that — for that old, shitty son of a gun. I kind of forgot what
he had been before and didn’t really dwell upon it. Things happen and you go. And
ordinarily we did help one another. We did help one another. It was kind of a dog eat dog
at times, when some people tried to get to the top and become a top dog, they had to kill
and steal and do the horrible things. But there was cases people did help one another. I
didn’t — I don’t know if I felt compassion or if I were just — saw him so miserable, I said,
“Okay, you dog, eat that bread. Maybe — maybe your loose stomach will stop.”

Q: Did he change his attitude towards you, afterwards?

A: He was still grumbling. He didn’t call me names any more. Because I wa— by that time I
was stronger. And he lost his job. He lost his job. He was not a lord almighty any more.
He could kill all 25 people he had, in one day, if he wanted to. He would get 20 — a pack
of cigarettes for it. He did beat many people, I don — never saw him kill anybody, but he
could if he wanted to. So maybe he wasn’t very bad. But angel Gabriel, he was not.

Q: How — how do you think that — that — those experiences in the war and then in the camps,
how did they shape you as a person?

A: I don’t think they made me any better. Maybe they made me a little more understanding.
But they did not deflate my ego. And I still talk a blue streak. Well, they made me —
surviving it made me very thankful, as I previously said. I never prayer — had — pray a
prayer of petition. I always say a small prayer of thanksgiving. So it made me appreciate
life and the presently, I mean, I wake up every morning and I feel so free. And I’m not
hungry and I’m not cold. And I have a darn good job. I love books and I work with
books. I buy a lot of books, I’ll sell a few books. I'll read. I work five and a half days in
the bookstore. Every second Monday, you go to public library, we get our 10 or 15
books, so we have something to read. Sylvia reads too, a lot.

10:03:31

Q: Your wife?
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 81

A: My wife, Sylvia reads a lot, too. And every Thursday Sylvia comes downtown on a bus
and we have lunch and we talk blue streak. Because normally, after supper — when she
has supper ready when I come from work. I come on a bus and I walk a mile. We eat
supper, I wash the dishes and we sit with our noses in a book. So, to preserve domestic
tranquillity, we get together once a wook — once a week and we have a lunch out. Just
like one person said, I think it was a good saying, “My family — family ate out a lot, but
they always went to the cheap places.” That’s it.

Q: You said that you wake up and you think, “I’m not cold, I’m not hungry.”

A: And I’m free.

10:04:29

Q: “And I’m free.” And that made me wonder, is that feeling of — of having everything taken
away from you, of being hungry, or your freedom being taken away, is that a really real
feeling sometimes? Can you remember it like it’s right there?

A: I can — I can’t remember it. Occasionally — well mainly, what — I remember it in the — in
dreams. I used to have nightmares. Presently I have them very seldom. I probably will
have one next couple nights. When I saw Schindler’s List — after | saw Schindler’s List, 1
had a couple real — just almost like — like it really happened there and I was there back —
back there. But it is so far away. One time, St. Paul Cathedral was showing a film,
Nacht'** — Night and Fog. The film still exists. It was made by the Polish French
company and you can still get the video of it. Anyway, I was asked to come and watch
with them and to talk about it later on. Well, it was shortly after I came here and after that
went — that went through, I could not talk, mainly because I saw the steps. Hundred and
eighty-six steps from a stone quarry, leading to the camp in Mauthausen. And I walked
those steps for 11 days, carrying a big stone. When you first came into Mauthausen, you
went through the introduction, you were put in a Strafkommando, punishment company.
You went down to the quarry and you went up, you went down. Oh, it was about six,
seven times a day and you took the biggest stone you could carry, because if you didn’t,
when you got to about 100 steps up, the Kapo would look and said, “Hey you and you
and you and you, step out there. You stupid so and so. Look at the rest of them, they are
just breaking down, getting ruptures. And you took two those little stones?” So he give
them a push and they would fly down. And that happened just about every day. Five, 10 -
15 -20 people would be killed a day, in the Strafkommando. And sometime, when he had
a special order, they would make people run. It was Fliegerbriicke,'” the flying bridge.
There was a kind of a little platform and he would run people to the platform and they
would fly down, like two or 300 feet. And then the quarry supervisor started complaining
that they messed — “He is messing up my work, so make him stop. That so and so is

4 Night (German)

5 Flyer’s bridge (German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 82
messing up my work. He had all those — those — all that mess, those smashed prisoners
there. I have to clean it up every day.”

10:07:37
So it kind of abated, but he was still killing people. If he didn’t do that, when you — didn’t
like you or you got close up and the upper was kind of a steep road into the gate, front
gate of the Grosse Tor — he would take your hat, we had those stripped berets — he would
take it and make it fly beyond the post line. And you had to put your stone down,
everybody waited and you went to retrieve it. And that was a no-no, because it was
beyond the line, and people up on the tower there would open up and shoot you.
Sometimes they would just wound you, most of the time they would kill you. And you
had to go and retrieve your hat because if you walked to the gate, you had to take your
hat and walk at attention, you know, your hat to your leg and walk stiffly and carry your
big stone here, you know. Straighten up. SS at the gate, if you did not have a hat to take
off, they would take you — take you aside and beat you — most of the time they would
take you aside and shoot you. There would be pile of people, dead bodies on the side,
people who did not have their hats with them. Those little exercises. I made it for 11 days
and lived to tell. Anyway, it was kind of a little introduction to the system.

Q: And so when you saw those steps again —

A: When I saw those steps, I could not talk. Hundred and eighty-six steps — stone steps,
quite steep. Just try to walk 180 — 80 steep — 86 steps carrying nothing, at a good clip. I
don’t think I could now. I walk up a bunch of steps when you go to state park and you
hear, “Oh, let’s stand down for awhile, Steven, let’s take a rest.”

Q: Does it surprise you, what you were able to endure?

A: Yes, it does. But in that time, it was nothing. I just thought I was tough son of a gun. I
couldn— I could do anything. Especially after surviving two and a half, almost — well not
exactly three — is about two and a half years in Polish underground with a — with a
fighting group. That was a survival. Later on, camp at times, was almost like a — well,
kind of a mild danger. You avoid this, you avoid that, you may live forever. You are
hungry, maybe you can organize something, you can steal something. Maybe somebody
will give you piece of bread. Maybe you’ll catch a dog.

10:10:14

Q: And so, just tell us a little bit about how you left the displaced person’s camp.

A: Yes, I—I stayed and worked most of the time, most of the people didn’t. They didn’t
want to. People who stay in places who don’t have to work, they don’t want to work. We
talk sometime about our welfare people, they’re paid little and not to have to work.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 83
People who don’t work, won’t work. There were probably — out of five, eight, 10,000, in
Wildflecken, maybe 200 of us who worked. The rest of the people didn’t. And I knew
one person who was a black market operator, he was a rich — one rich young man. And
each person were living in a camp had to donate half a day work to the camp, like
chopping trees for the fuel, sweeping streets or doing something. Well, he didn’t. So he
was called to the camp director and the camp director said, “Mr. So and So, I have a
report here you haven’t worked last week.” And said, “Mr. Director, that’s a lie. I never
worked.” “You never worked? You are supposed to work.” “I pay well, people who go
and work for me. When my time comes, there is a person who goes and works for me
hard, for half a day or a day, I pay him well. Mr. Director, that’s a lie, I never worked.”
That was the mentality of — that people developed. Later on when they went to various
countries, there were some were repatriated to Poland, but very few. When Communism
took over, they did not want to, as I didn’t want to. Many went to Canada, many went —
many — some — everybody wanted to come to America. Some went to Belgium, some
went to England. Many went to Australia and New Zealand. While those people had — at
times had a hard time adjusting back and going back to work. So I stayed in Wildflecken
until 1949 and the U.S. Catholic Conference found a sponsor here and I went through the
consul and a doctor and document this and document that — all kind of little documents.
As the Russians said, “S propiskom vsyé mozhna’”® zrobic.'”” With a little card, you can
do almost anything. Ru— in Russia, if you had to have a propiska'™* to move from place to
place, to visit next village, you have to have a propiska issued by police because you
cannot move freely. Well, now maybe you can, but that time you could not. So all this
little documents and you had to go through a doctor and — well, I worked part time with
American CIC. '”° They came one time when I was still in Aschaffenburg.

10:13:30

Q: CIC?

A: The American CIC people came and talked to me and said, “We are catching some of the
German criminals and we kind of feel that you may some — have something against it,
would you want to help us?” “Sure.” “How much you want to paid?” “Paid? If I had
money, I would pay you.” CIC was the counter-intelligent corps, U.S. Army. There were
two captains who worked there and I worked with them until full maturation. One or two
days a week I would get release from the police force and work with them. We went
across the green border into East Germany and occasionally apprehended somebody who
was being searched for and brought him back.

Q: War criminals?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 84

A: Nazis — war criminals, yes.

Q: The Nazis, okay.

A: And then questioned them. Then when they had Polish Nazis questioned, I would help
them question. Then when he had Polish Communists sneaking in, I would help them
question those. So then they helped me a lot, too — to go through and get in. Yes, but was
mostly the Catholic organization who found me sponsor here. I came to St. Paul, I lived
with a old couple — old, ancient couple for quite some time, paid room and board. Then I
moved out and leaded my little — one little single room overlooking the whole city. I had
a beautiful view, it was up on a hill. Old house with little rooms and a landlady who
charged us very little rent. It was a very carefree life.

Q: Is there something that I haven’t asked you that you’d like to say?

A: Not really, I think we just did almost everything. Oh yes. Yes, I — I met Hans Christian,
who was my interrogator.

10:15:36

Q: Your German interrogator?

A: Yes, my German interrogator. Ph.D. from Heidelberg University. He was arrested, he
was in jail under different name and Captain Wulkanowski took me — took me to
Briickenau, where the man was in jail and he said, “Stefan, maybe you would like to talk
to this man, he speaks Polish.” So they took me to his cell and I said, “Hans Christian,
what are you doing here?” “Was machen Sie da hier?!" And he looked, he said,
“Stefan?” “Yeah.” “Du bist no’ nit tot?'?!” I said, “Well, if I was dead, I’m resurrected.”
So I asked him what his name is and he had different name. I said, “His name is Hans
Christian. He was in — a Gestapo interrogator. When he was questioning me, he took me
out four times and shot next to me, four different people and told me I was going to be
the next one if I don’t tell him what he wants to know. And I know that those people are
not tried to be executed.” I testified against him. So he — Mister — Captain Wulkanowski
said, “Well” — he chain him. He chain him to the bed. He said, “Stay a while. Beat the
shit out of him.” I said, “Okay, I'll stay with him for awhile.” So we — I stayed and we
talked. He said, “Aren’t you going to beat me?” I said, “No, I’m not going to beat you.
You will get your reward.” He said, “Well, you know, really, I didn’t want to beat you
either, but I was doing my job.” Said, “Well, now I would be doing my job.” So then I
knocked on the door and said, “Well, I’m sorry. I’m going to testify against you, I know
who you are.” And I did. And I understand that couple years later he wa— couple years

‘8° What are you doing there here? (German)

8! Aren’t you dead yet? (Austrian German)
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 85
later he was hanged. But I wasn’t asked to come to the execution. And Captain
Wulkanowski, I walked out and said, “Take my pistol, go and shoot the son of a bitch.” I
said, “Shoot him? You people can hang him, I don’t want to shoot him.” Yeah, Hans
Christian. Beautiful, tall, blonde man with blue eyes and beautiful bleach hair.

10:18:10

Q: Some people would have wanted to kill him.

A: I don’t know. We promised ourselves, when we were in a camp, when we were in Gusen,
when the freedom come, if we are alive, we will go burning, killing. Not raping because
we are not strong enough, but we will do horrible things here. Nobody did anything. The
only one atrocity that we committed — that people committed in a camp — was a Spanish
from a Spanish civil war — his name was Santacara. He was Oberkapo'” of the first shift.
He had under him about 20,000 people. And he beat people and he killed people, he
drowned people. If, if somebody he didn’t like, he would just pick them up and — and tip
him.

[Technical conversation]

He was very bad person, he would — didn’t like somebody, he would lead a person to a
washroom, pick him up and put him in the barrel head first and drown him. I mean he
was just a bad person. Anyway, there were a bunch of Russians who hated him, because
he especially hated Russians, I don’t know why, because he was a Spanish Communist
and the Russians were Russian Communists, but he hated them. So they nailed him —
they stripped him, they nailed him to the barrack by hands and feet and they took a heavy
machine gun and they shot him to pieces. And I watched — when I was in the hospital I
watched out of my window — was — my bunk was next to the window, I watched it. And I
asked, “Who that was?” “Oh, was Santacara.” “Oh, Santacara. May God be merciful of
his, of — over — over his mortal soul — immortal soul.” So I know one — saw one atrocity
committed by the former prisoners.

Q: Is there anything else? Besides these things? I have got one question I’ve got ask you.
Okay.

A: All right.

10:20:30

Q: You said that you— [Break in tape] befriend him and how did — how—? Did he know who
you were?

'8? Senior foreman (German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to supervise Kapos.
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 86

A: Yeah, well we met — we met in a beer joint, I mean we were — a drinking place. And there
were a couple street girls with me and I introduced him to them and he said, “Do you
want to come tomorrow, have a drink with me? I’ll bring some good schnapps.” So I
came the next day. Instead of watery beer, he had some good schnapps, we had a drink
and we used to meet from time to time. And he even did me little favors. He liked those
two girls, apparently. So later on discovered he was the supply officer, I kind of went
clo— and I showed a bunch of money, said, “Would you like some money?” “Ja, J a!
What do you want me to sell you?” I said, “A Schmeisser.” “Ja.” “Zwei Schmeissers?!*”
“Ja.” “Fiinf und zwanzig Schmeissers?'*” “Twenty-five Schmeissers?” “Ja. Wieviel?'°”
So I said, “Well, about 200,000 marks.” “Well, zwei hundert, tausend?!*’ Hundert
Schmeissers.'**” “Ganz gut.” So he —he sold it to me. He had it delivered to a place
where I want it, driving the truck himself, we unloaded it. He went — happy with his
money. A good German can sell you his mother or daughter. Well, I have a — after the
war | had a lady who used to do my washing, a German lady, refugee lady who had a
bunch of children and she escaped from the eastern part of Germany to western part of
Germany, she has a daughter, was “Rita the Virgin.” And I went out with her daughter a
few times and she says, “Stefan, be sure that you don’t go to sleep with my daughter.” I
said, “Frau Anders, '°’ I would never go to sleep with a beautiful young girl.” “Rita is a
virgin.” Well, we called her from then on, we called “Rita the Virgin.” “I would let Rita
sleep with a rich American who would give me a big bag of Polen kaffee'# — unground
coffee. Because ground coffee was always adulterated. If a rich American came and gave
me a big bag of Polen kaffee, I would let him sleep with Rita.” So, a good German can
sell you anything you want to, if you pay enough. Also I was lucky. He could have
reported me. He could have shot me on the stop — spot, too, because he was armed.

10:23:14

Q: He could have taken the money and then reported you.

A: He could have taken the money too. Well, he was an honest thief.

A: Right, that was my little visit to my home village, from the forest. I’m the second one
from the left, in britches and funny hat. I behave like a peacock of course. I thought I was
on the top of the world. So that’s awful little.

[Technical conversation]

Yeah, this was taken sometime in 1943, on Sunday afternoon. It was shortly after my
encounter with blowing the building where the Einsatzgruppen stayed. And I came home
to celebrate and that was my neighbor, his name is Tadeusz and I’m the one on the right.
And I looked blonde and bleached, with big, blue eyes. Yeah, that is a —a shield of a 11th
armored division. Those were the people who liberated Gusen Zwei, Gusen Eins and
Mauthausen concentration camps. There comes a great detective in Wildflecken
displaced person camps in Bavaria, Germany. I think I’m on the way from work. Don’t I
look like a peacock?

Q: This is about 1946 or ‘47?

A: Forty-seven, ‘48. That is so and so in Wildflecken. It was a main square in Wildflecken,
in the back there’s one of the buildings that people lived. And I think I was on the way to
see a pretty girl.

10:25:55
This was taken shortly after I did get out of a hospital and went to sanatorium. My hair
grow up and I gained a lot of weight. Ate a lot of soup and gained weight, probably half a
pound a day. That is Hohenfels Erholungsheim. That means “Hohenfels TB Sanatorium.”
It was a castle on a top of a hill that was used as a recuperation center for German flyers
during the war and after war it became a TB sanatorium for refugees from all countries of
Europe. It is my Ausreise'*! — it means document. When I worked as a detective in
Wildflecken displaced person camp. It was at times fun, at times was little harrowing. We
met all kind of people, some criminals, some petty criminals. It was an interesting job.
This is a transit camp in Hamburg-Altona. We stayed there for about a week or so before
taking ship to America. That was a document issued to me by German authorities in
Bamberg, when I was in the hospital there, denoting that I was an honest to goodness
political prisoner of the German Nazis.

Q: Wow. That was probably an important piece of paper to have.

A: It was — it was, yes.

Q: Authenticating what you had experienced that.

A: This is a document issued by Polish prisoner organization, telling that I really was who I
was. They had a very strict verification commission. You have to ask — answer many
questions. They did not want — did not want anybody to sneak in. So that is the document
they finally issued to me. No, I don’t think I want to go to work any more. Where do you
work at?

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski, April 8, 1998, Minneapolis, Minnesota,
conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number 11.

A: All right. This is a poem, written by Polish poet, whose name is Michal Piasecki. He’s a
Polish Jew who escaped the Holocaust simply because he escaped to Soviet Russia. He
spent the war times — war time in Magnitogorsk, in Ural Mountains, working for the
Russians. He had a great sympathy with the Communism and I don’t care too much for
him, but he’s a good poet, I love his poems. I’m translating some of his poems to be
published in this country, here. And this is one of them. I would like to read it in Polish
and English.

Rosol z fasola, z cieniutkim makaronem,
Kura — po zydowsku dzielona — cwiartek osiem miala.
W szabas Bog nakazal odposzywac

Inad Tora chwalic imie Jego.

Czynic mykwe czyli dobry uczynek —
Zawsze, nie tylko dnia siodmego.

Moj szabas zdeptano w czasach pogardy,
Kiedy te skaze znalezli w rodowodzie.
Kolorami jeszcze dalie igraly, gdy,
Przystani szukalem gdzies n Wschodzie.

Szabas nieraz w snach powraca,
Ta sama gwiazda zamigoce,
Te same dalie weiaz igraja.
Przesnilem takie piekne noce.”

The English translation is:
“Sabbath
Our pine table is shrouded in white.
Dusk comes; kitchen fires die.
Candles in menorah mother will place,
First star like diamond will shine.
Street empty. I’ll close the shutters now.
Water vendor his yoke will put by the well,
To synagogue he walks, counting his pennies.
Sabbath todi— today, Fiszel does not trade.
By the window, birch racing for the sky,
Candlelight timidly shines afar.
Stillness, only aspen leaves whisper softly.
By mother hands, the light shines bright,
By prie— by prayer blessed, so then suddenly alive.
This one and that one took flight to God,
Praying and begging for plenty to all,
Health of a husband and children’s health.
Father in a mood, not ugly, sat behind the table.
Did not loose faith in good times to come,
So that instead of hope in the promissory notes,
For his tedious sewing, simple cash will flow.
Three dishes served of yore in Jerusalem,
Gefilte fish in fish sauce and a soft challah,
Chicken soup with beans with angel hair macaroni,
Hen — Jewish style — divided to make eight quarters of one.
Sabbath is for your rest, just like good Lord ordered
And with His Torah to proclaim his name.
To perform ablutions and all those good deeds —
Good deeds do always, not only on the Sabbath day.
My Sabbath was trampled in these times of horror,
When evil mark was spotted in ancestral scrutiny.
Dahlias in bloom, charmed and enchanted us,
Safe ha — safe harbor here I searched for in a Far Eastern way.
Sabbath at times comes in dreams.
The same stars are shining by,
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0387 91
The same dahlias still bloom.

And still of great old times, we daydream.”
That’s it.

Q: Okay.

probably would be very proud to send you a copy for your archives and very likely he
probably could send you some of his poems. This poems were brought back from — back
from Poland by Professor Sher,!”? who is at the University of Minnesota. Matter of fact,
he is presently teaching for three years in Auckland, New Zealand. It was — he’s some
kind of a specialist in economy. He met that man and they talked and that man presented
him with a bunch of his poems. And Mr. Sher gave them to me to translate and he has
intention to publish them, possibly in a Tikkun Magazine. '” He’s still working on it. I
don’t know how soon — how long will it take him. It seems to take him forever.

Q: Id be glad to take his address.

A: Yes.
