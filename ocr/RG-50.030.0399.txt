A: She was not a maid, but she was like a part of the family, but she was helping my mother, too,
to cook, to clean the house.
Q: Can you tell us something about your family, your mother and your father?
A: My father was a engineer. He was educated in Russian school, and the Russian university. So
family was not religious. I would say assimilated Jews. We spoke -- at home we spoke Russian
and on the streets we spoke Polish. My father was born in Wilna to aristocratic family. When he
was young he belonged to a sor -- not a communist, but a social revolution -- revolutionist party,
and he was even expelled from the last grade of gymnasium. But because he was a brilliant
student, they allowed him to pass the last exams -- exam, by himself at special ec -- exams. He
passed it brilliantly, and he was accepted to the University of San Petra -- Petrabuk -- Saint
Peterburg, I’m sorry. And then he finished there -- he -- he didn’t finish the Petraburg University,
he studied there two year -- for two years, and then I don’t know on which family reasons, they -
- they left Russia for Poland -- but Poland was also Russia then, Poland was occupied by
Russians. And he finished at Technical University in Warsaw. He finished it and I saw the
diploma in ghetto, actually. Was a diploma with a gold medal. But he couldn’t find a -- a job as
an engineer, but it -- the first World War -- World War broke out, and he went. He was a -- a
soldier ze -- probably the only one -- Russian soldier with a university degree. I have a picture of
him, I don’t know where it is [indecipherable] actually, with the university sign, you know. And
then after war he came with his family to Wilna, back to Wilna, because they run from the
Germans, even on the first World War, to Russia, and they came back after war and Wilna
became Poland again. And he couldn’t find a job as engineer, he started to teach mathematics
and physics. Course this is -- was his -- his field. He finished mathematics and physics in
technical school. He was a teacher of high school gymnasium, and then he went to stu -- to teach

at the sch -- technical school, and the techni -- then he was a principal of the technical school. It
was -- I think it was only one technical school in Poland which were especially for Jewish
students because all the subjects were taught in -- in Yiddish. And my father didn’t know
Yiddish before, yeah. So he -- he learned, he learned Yiddish and had a very fine Yiddish, very
clear, very good pronounce [indecipherable]. And he was the principal, the director of the school
until the World War II broke out.
Q: What -- what is your father’s name?
A: My father’s name is Matthias. Matthias Shreyber. My mother was also very high educated
lady. She finished the Russian gymnasium, then she finished a course of -- I think that -- that the
women were not allowed to -- to stay in -- at uni -- at the university, so they -- it was a organized
in Russia, a course for a -- higher courses for women. So she finished chemistry, something with
-- with chemistry now. But she haven’t worked. She was running the house and the children. She
knew seven languages. Yeah. English and Italian, and German was her mother tongue. My
grandmother was from Berlin. She married a Polish Jew, and she came to Wilna with my -- but
she spoke only German at home and my mother’s first language was German, but because she
was educated in Russian schools, so with my father, at home with us, she spoke Russian.
Q: What was your mother’s name?
A: My mother’s name Valentina.
Q: Her maiden name?
A: Zhouk. Valentina Zhouk.
Q: How did your parents meet?
A: My mother was friendly with a owner of a -- this was a private Jewish school, a gymnasium, a
very good ha -- very good [indecipherable] gymnasium, private. My -- my father was a teacher

there, so she once came there and they met. She told me she fell in love with him at once, he was
a very handsome man. And that’s it.
Q: What do you remember about being a young, young girl i-in the house? What wa -- what was
-- what was a day like, or a meal like?
A: My father insisted that me and my brother, we have to attend a Yiddish school, a progressive
Yiddish school, and we spoke -- with my brother, I spoke Yiddish, because we -- we -- we -- we
thought that my mother doesn’t understand it, but because she knew very well German, and
Yiddish is -- if you know Yiddish you understand German, if you know German, you can’t
understand not everything, not -- but the meaning of the sentence you can understand in Yiddish.
My brother was five years o-older, a very handsome and very, very good natured boy. And I was
not so good natured, and I used to argue with him and fight with him. I think he hated me. I don’t
know. I was not a good one. I was always --
Q: [indecipherable] tell us his name?
A: His name was Joseph. And ne -- and we used to -- to call him Josek, from wor -- Joseph. Fr-
French, Joseph.
Q: S-So you say that your family was not religious.
A: No.
Q: Did religion play any role at all in family life?
A: No, no. Nothing. And at school they were educated also very secular and it’s a pity, I think.
We lost something, because I -- I don’t know any of the Jewish holidays -- I didn’t know -- now
I know, coming back to Canada so I know when it’s Rosh Hashanah and Passover, and Yom
Kippur. I didn’t know before.

Q: Can you talk a little bit about your neighborhood, what that was like and whether or not there
were other Jewish families, or non-Jewish families?
A: Yeah, it was a mixed neighborhood. There were Jewish families over there, but not a lot. And
it was a neighbor -- it was not a very good neighborhood because my grandfather had a factory,
and he wanted to build his house -- he has a factory, so it was such a -- if you can say industrial
neighborhood more or less. It was not a beautiful neighborhood, but our house was beautiful.
Q: The grandfather was on your mother’s side, or your father’s side?
A: On my mother’s side. On my father’s side, he was a rabbiner. It’s not a rabbi, but a rabbiner
of the city of Wilna.
Q: What -- what does that mean?
A: You know, exactly I don’t know za -- but I know that he like provided his papers like birth
certificates and marriage certificates and he had the -- the books -- the archives of that Jewish
community and so on. He was also educated [indecipherable]
Q: Do you know the names of your grandparents on either side?
A: The first name, I think it was Abraham Shreyber. I don’t know my grandmother’s name. I
know that -- oho -- his -- his name was Samuel. That’s why I was Shulanis, named after his -- my
gran --
Q: Samuel Shreyber.
A: -- yeah, it’s Samuel Shreyber, yeah. And I don’t know my grandmother’s name. And my
grandmother from my mother’s side was Frederica, her name, and I don’t remember her maiden
name, it was a German name, something -- something like -- I don’t know. And my -- my
grandfather from my mother’s side was Joseph Zhouk. Yeah, that -- my brother was named that.

and she died of a heart attack. The thing is they came fr -- they run from Russia to Wilna when
the revolution started. They came very poor, they didn’t -- they lost everything in Russia and she
couldn’t probably bear it. And after her, in three or four months my grandfather died. That’s it.
[indecipherable]
Q: What was your position in the Jewish community, your families position? Your father is a -- a
-- apr -- a principal, I think.
A: Yeah.
Q: Can you just sort of describe where they fit into the --
A: Yeah, he was a very prominent actually, in the community a very famous person. Everybody
knew him from Wilna, everybody -- oh, [indecipherable] Shreyber [indecipherable]. And he was
in several committees, very active in several committees, so very honest and real. He was active
in the -- in the -- in Jewish com -- committees, yes. You know, when the first -- when the second
World War broke out, so I was only 11 years old, and [indecipherable] I -- then I di -- was not
very interested in such things without my parents and I know only that he adored our father.
[indecipherable] it was everything, and he didn’t dare not to obey him. But my mother, my
mother could tell me thousand times to do something, I wouldn’t do it. It’s -- it -- yeah. It’s a pity
[indecipherable]
Q: You say that your -- your father was involved in the community. Do you ever remember him
talking about that, and about wh-why he was involved?
A: You know, the parents were -- it’s -- it’s -- it was an absolute another life before the war, I
mean. I heard my parents talking but always in their bedroom with the doors clo -- with the door
closed, so we didn’t know what -- what’s going on there. I mean, their discussions. My mother
loved very much my father, that I know. And my father was very polite, never -- you know,

never raised his voice. And but they had discussions but each one political or something else, I
don’t know. I really don’t know. And I don’t think that my brother, who was older, he probably
didn’t know either.
Q: How -- how did you think of yourselves? Did you think that you were Polish, Russian,
Jewish? H-How did you think of yourselves as an identity of your family?
A: I was sure that Iam Jewish, because I attended a Yiddish school, and I was sure that to be a
Jew it doesn’t mean to be a religious Jew. I was taught Yiddish literature, Yiddish writers, poets,
history of the Jews. That was enough only to -- to be proud of my nation, and to feel that I am
Jewish. I never avoided it, never.
Q: Do you remember as a young girl, eight, nine, 10, ex -- every experiencing any anti-
Semitism?
A: Oh yeah, very much. I didn’t look -- it’s -- it’s maybe strange to say that here, but the
European Jews have a special look, and I was blonde, and you can see not dark eyes. I looked -- I
didn’t look like a Jewish girl. And my -- my brother -- my brother was black hair, black eyes,
and -- and th -- because our school didn’t work on Saturday, so we were -- it was open on
Sundays. So we usually went on Sundays with our bags, school bags, to school. And that was a
reason to fight. So I don’t know, nobody f-fought me, but my brother. And it was a time when he
had in his pocket, a castet, I don’t know how it is in English, it’s like an iron thing what you put
your fingers there.
Q: Brass knuckles.
A: Yeah. And that what you can fight back. And -- and it was a time when he didn’t walk from
school to -- to home. Usually we walked it, it was not so far, but we didn't have a car of course, it
was very seldom they were having a car, it was a big luxury. So, he went by bus from school

home, and he -- he didn’t get off on the right stop, but a stop after that, and went home from
another side because a group of guys were waiting for him on the corner of our street, and the
other streets. It was -- we were -- our house was located near a corner of two streets, all -- that
was it.
Q: Who were the guys?
A: I don’t know, [indecipherable] the neighborhood guys. It was a bar on the corner and they
were drinking there [indecipherable]. They amused themself with fighting with Jews.
Q: Were they Polish, or --
A: Yeah, yeah. Yeah it was not a big mixture of nationalities there, it was a very big percentage
Jews, and -- and that -- probably 25 percent of the population of Wilna are Jewish. So then it was
a little bit of White Russian, and a little bit Lithuanian. And mostly they are Poles.
Q: Did you and Joseph ever talk about that, about how to protect yourselves in these situations?
A: No. I mean, I don’t remember. I don’t remember. There were other things what I remember. I
remember walking through the streets near university and looking at the [indecipherable] house,
on -- on the windows, how the students, the Jewish students were standing on the lectures, not
sitting. Yeah. It was a protest because some of the Polish students decided that Polish students
have to sit separately on the one side, and it was left the other side of the whole auditorium was
left for the Jews -- Jewish students. So the Jewish student decided no, they will not sit separately,
they will stand. So they stand, all lectures they were standing behind the benches there, that they
[indecipherable]. Then they had an -- a church, and it was to go through the church, it was like a
-- a gate, yeah? And so Jewish people are walking through, if it’s winter they were wearing the
hats. So -- and the Catholics had to remove their hats. So, if you don’t remove their -- your hats,
you are beaten and remove the hat from -- such things. But I had friends, Polish also. I played

with them in the streets and the -- if | heard something like bad, like they are cursing me or
something, so I used to stand, I remember, in our -- the gate of our garden with stones and waited
for them. And they knew it [indecipherable]. I’1l not let them walk through without throwing the
stones to them. So they were a little bit afraid of me. But they were little also. I didn’t have to do
this big guys, of course. Little like me, 10 - 11 -12 years old, you know.
Q: You came down to do this interview with an old friend, with Rachel Lerdis.
A: Yeah.
Q: Who you knew -- whom you knew when you were young. I’m wondering if you could tell us
about your first memories of her, how you met her, or just your first memories of being together
with her when you were young.
A: I met her when we were in the country. We rented a house in the country, and their family
rented a house in the country, the r -- the houses were close. And -- and then her family came
from Warsaw, the sisters with their families. And that’s how we met with her. And Is --
Q: [indecipherable]
A: I remember her always smiling [indecipherable] nice looking girl. And my brother was more
involved in it than I, yeah. Yeah. I think that the love started from there. They were 16 probably
or so. And I was 11, so that I -- he was 16, and she --
Q: You’re referring to the fact that your -- your brother and Rachel Lerdis when they were
young, dated.
A: Yes, yeah.
Q: Yes. What did you speak with each other?
A: With whom? With Rachel?
Q: Rachel.

A: I don’t think we spoke a lot before the war. I don’t think so. When I finished my six year
school, it was a -- the first -- how it’s called in English, oh my God, elementary school. When I
finished the elementary school, I went to the same gymnasium where Rachel was, and my
brother. So there I saw them more often together. Otherwise I -- I was not very close to her
before the war.
Q: Did your parents know each other?
A: I don’t think so.
Q: Your parents and her parents?
A: I don’t think so.
Q: But they must have met in the country, but just briefly?
A: Maybe, but I don’t -- I don’t know about that. I don’t know.
Q: When do you remember beginning to feel the war closing in, or things changing? Do you
have first memories of that, of --
A: Oh yeah.
Q: What happened?
A: It was a bombing before we [indecipherable] telling us that the -- the -- the war started, so
they bombed Wilna. The Germans were -- bombed Wilna. That I remember.
Q: But even before that [indecipherable]
A: Oh before that, yeah, it’s true --
Q: Can you talk a bit about that, yeah.
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The war started with Poland. Yeah, it’s true. It was in September ’39 when
the war started. And we felt it immediately. Immediately it was a shortage of food. In the stores

line -- people were lined up to buy food. I remember that I don’t know how, in the kitchen I saw
a whole sack of sugar, salt and something else, kasha or something else, I don’t know. And --
Q: What did that mean to see that?
A: It -- it meant that it can be a [indecipherable] and they are ready to eat. And then I had a
friend, a boyfriend. His parents had a bakery, and we run to the bakery with him. And I saw a big
line, people waiting for the bread, and we went to ano -- for -- from another side inside the
bakery. And he used to take a big loaf of br -- of bread, yeah, and give me -- ha -- hot bread, and
it smelled so good, and used to bring it home. And the lady who lived with us, who helped my
mother, her name was Julia. She used to say, “Oh, my God, if Luda wants to eat, she has an
appetite, it means it will be a hunger.” I was never hungry when I was child. It was not -- my
mother was crazy about me. Never hungry. I didn’t want to eat, I -- I -- I don’t remember feeling
something that I want something. It will some --
Q: You di -- you -- your mother thought you didn’t eat enough when you were young?
A: Yeah, of course --
Q: Yeah.
A: -- because I didn’t eat enough. That’s -- that -- that was that, yeah. I was very pale and very
thin, and my mother was unhappy with it. But then the war started, and it was a shot at your foot,
so I started to eat.
Q: Do you remember your brother or your parents talking about the changes?
A: [remember my mother. My mother was very -- can’t say upset, because it’s more than upset.
She was very unhappy with it. And fer -- we had books at home, books of -- books which
described the situation in Germany after Hitler come -- came to power. It was called, I remem --
I remember it, the book was la -- lying on -- on the table in our room in -- in-in my bedroom. So

it was called Brunatnec Shenga in Polish. Brunatnec, it means brown, because fascists had
brown, you know, shirts. And it was horrible. There -- there are pictures there about the
concentration camps already in Germany. At first. political concentration camp. Communist
party in Germany was very popular, and a lot of Germans were communists, so the first victims
were the communists of course, you know. And my mother -- my mother knew the Germans
very well. I don’t know why. I don’t think she was born in -- in -- in Germany. I th -- her mother
was born in Germany, so -- and they used to go to Germany every -- every summer, probably.
And my mother knew the character of the Germans, so she told my father, I remember, we have
to leave Wilna. We have to out of it. Go out of Europe. I hate it. He didn’t want. He didn’t want.
She wanted to emigrate, to the States, to Canada, to Australia, but not to stay in Europe. That’s it.
That was it, yeah. That why I remember it. And -- but we waited the Germans to come to -- to
Wilna in 1939 already, because Polish army couldn’t stand -- couldn’t protect Poland, was too
weak. Poles are very good soldiers actually, but they didn’t have the tanks, they didn’t have the
equipment the -- the Germans had, so -- but the Russian came before. They occupied Wilna, they
occupied all the -- the best, Belaru --White Russia, Belarusia, White Russia and Ukraine. So we
found ourselves in -- occupied by Russians. What was better than by Germans, of course. It was
probably two, three months m -- the Russians were in Wilna, the hosts of Wilna, ba -- but then
they gave it to Lithuania. The day the Lithuanians wanted to take over Wilna was a fight between
the Poles and -- the Polish -- the remnants of the Polish army and the Lithuanian army. But the
fight was very, very short. And suddenly they decided that it has to be a pogrom. They have to --
to kill Jews. We don’t know why. Couldn’t understand why. What has it to do with -- with pola -
- with Poland and Lithuania? They were always tense. There were no diplomatic relationships
between pola -- Poland and Lithuania before, even. So the day the Lithuanian occupied -- no,

took over Wilna, so it was a pogrom. I was at home, my mother didn’t allow me to go to school,
but my son -- my brother was i-in school, and she was so nervous about it. And -- and then it was
the whole day, broken glasses, and so on and so on. But then I think that a delegation of Jewish
people went to the Russians, who gave the city to Lithuanian. But they had a place where they
just -- they were -- that their armia was standing there, together with their tanks and everything.
So the Jews went there and asked them for helping us. And they decided -- the Russians decided
to go with the tanks through the streets. And that was enough. They didn’t do anything, they
didn't kill anybody, they didn’t -- the Russians I mean. They went through the streets with their
tanks, and it was quiet, quiet. It’s a -- quiet down everybody. Then my brother came back from
school, late in the evening. He -- he told us that they barricaded the windows and the doors with
[indecipherable] the tables they had in the classes. And they were waiting. Nothing special. Was
no killed people, no, nothing. Only the -- the windows were broken. That is -- that what I
remember, the beginning of -- of the war. And then they were almost a year -- yeah, then the
Lithuanian were -- they started learning Lithuanian -- the Lithuanian language at school, and --
another language. We had a lot of languages in school. Had Yiddish, Polish, Hebrew, German
and then Lithuanian, instead of --
Q: How did the atmosphere changed when the Lithuanians were in charge?
A: You know, that was for change that stores were -- special stores were open, Lithuanian stores,
Lithuanian companies came over. Interesting that the Polish president, the portrait of the Polish
president was gone from the wall in our classroom, and the Lithuanian sign is -- their official
sign is a -- a horse, and -- don’t remember [indecipherable] there. A horseman, who has a horse
with a sword, I think, something like that.
Q: A man on a horse?

A: Yeah, a man on a horse, yeah. Oh, and that was on the wall. So I remember such a thing, that
we decided to open the windows, that was in winter, we decided to open the windows in the
classroom, and it was before the language of -- oh, oh -- the lesson of the Lithuanian language,
the teacher came in, said, “It’s so cold, why didn’t you open the li -- why did you open the li --
the windows?” So we said, “The horse is stinking.” Suddenly, we became Polish patriots. We --
we played with the Polish children in the street, and we used to -- to throw on the sidewalks a -- a
-- the Lithuanian money, with the sign of their horse, and to beat it. And to -- and to say, go to
Kovno, go back to Kovno, go back to Kovno. Kovno was their capital. They made Wilna the
capital after that. Capital of Lithuania. Well, that was -- we became one block with the Poles
against the Lithuanian. Why? I don’t know. Don’t ask me, I don’t know.
Q: What were your parents saying to Joseph about continuing to go to school, or were there any
safeguards being made? You know, if this happens, don’t come home, or was there any talk like
that? Sort of beginning to prepare to -- for -- for trouble?
A: For --
Q: In any way?
A: At what time you’re asking it?
Q: A-At this time, when the Lithuanians -- after the day long pogrom with the Lithuanians and
when your brother had to be barricaded inside the school.
A: After that was quiet and -- it was quiet until the -- the World War II came to us. It was quiet,
yeah. Then, after -- how long was a -- a reign of the Lithuanian was a half a year, or a year? A
year, almost a year. Then the Russians decided to occupy the whole Lithuania. They gave them
Wilna, but they occupied the whole, you know. And then it was Russia already. In 1940 was
Russia, until -- and in ninete -- 1941 when the World War started, yeah.

Q: Was there a time when you noticed the Russians took control back and you had to learn
Russian in school again during this period?
A: I didn’t care about it because I spoke Russian and it was my language [indecipherable]. So,
but the year when the Russians were there, this year, was not a bad year for Jewish people. A lot
of Jewish school, Yiddish schools were open, yes, but I -- I -- I have to say that the Hebrew
schools were closed, I don’t know why. They were against the Hebrew, everything what was
Hebrew was not good. And of course, religious people suffered. But Yiddish secular schools
were -- a lot of Jewish secular schools were open, and we had a lot -- much more students in our
gymnasium than before.
Q: Oh, the students would come from the closed schools and go to yours?
A: Yeah, yeah. Not only that, but ther -- th -- it was a part of very poor people, who couldn’t
afford to pay for school. That’s why their children were at home, I don’t know, looking for a job,
looking for something. I don’t know what they were doing, but they couldn’t attend schools. And
then, when the Russians came, the schools were for free. And not only that, but every child had
to be at school. Had to be at school. So they came, and they were -- we have so many students.
That was -- for the poor people was much better.
Q: And -- and the stores, were they similar, for instance, your friend’s bakery, was that a Jewish
bakery?
A: Yeah, it was a Jewish bakery.
Q: Did it remain open, was -- wi -- were the -- was the Jewish family still in charge of it?
A: No. No, everything -- in [indecipherable] were not in charge of our house. Everything was
gone to the government. The government took over everything. Yeah, that’s -- yeah. Yeah.
Q: But you were still in your house?

A: Yes. [indecipherable] we are still in our house, yeah. Some were -- wanted us to go out of the
house and to take over the house, it was a problem there. But we stayed in the house, and my
father had the same position, but the technical -- Yiddish technical -- Jewish technical school was
a part of the pole -- Polish technical school. It means they were like one school, but one was total
-- that stu -- Polish students were taught in Polish and the e -- Jews in -- in Yiddish. But my
father was this -- had the -- had the same position still, this year.
Q: And do you remember seeing Rachel during this period, was Rachel seeing Joseph, your
brother?
A: Yeah, yeah, because we are at school. I was already the first grade of gymnasium. But the
school was -- was renamed, it was already not a gymnasium, but a high -- but a high school, and
I was not in the first grade of the gymnasium, but I was in the fifth grade of that 10 years school -
- high school. It was a 10 years high school. But --
Q: Did your parents -- as things shifted, did your parents ever discuss again, leaving? Did your
mother push that issue?
A: I think that yeah. But i -- I don’t think that it could be done already, it was too late. It was too
late, because I don’t think the Russians would allow us to go out. Poland didn’t exist already.
Part of the -- of Poland was Germany, and part Russia, that’s it. So, but she talked about it, yeah.
She talked about it. But she didn’t know how to do it over there, they said she was -- it’s a --
problem of immigration was closed for us, it’s [indecipherable]. But a friend of mine, who was
the same class, and his mother was a teacher of our school, their -- his father immigrated to the
States. He went to Europe for a conference in 1939, but before the war started, before September.
He went there with [indecipherable] oldest son. He was in Belgium, I think. And when the war
started, he took a ship and he went to ton -- to the States, America. Then he send the papers to

[indecipherable] his w-wife and the other son to come, and they received the visa. And they were
the -- the only people who -- who’d leave Russia because they had already the visa, then
Lithuanian were there. So they were allowed to go. And he’s still in the States, my friend.
Q: Really?
A: Yeah.
Q: At that point was there ever any thought that the ru -- that the Germans might come into
Vilnius?
A: Of course, yes. We were sure that it will -- the war stop, it will not remain like that. It was like
everything was -- fe-felt temporary. That today is like that, tomorrow can be changed everything,
yeah. It was not stable. Anything was not.
Q: It sounds anything but stable.
A: Yeah, yeah. And then we -- it was -- we finished school, I had -- we planned to go to -- leave
for vacation, and the bombs started to fall on Wilna, and my mother told my father immediately,
we have to run for Russia. And he didn’t want because he had a sister there. A sister who was
older than he was and she was like a mother for him. The mother was sick then, he was the
youngest boy -- y-youngest child in his family and she was taking care of him. So he didn’t -- he
didn’t want to leave without her. So he used to go to her -- to her apartment, to ask her to leave
with them, and she didn’t want. Her husband was in the States already. He visited his brother in
1938, and the -- the war started and he couldn’t come back. So he was in the States. So she was
alone with one daughter, and she told [indecipherable] we are not communists, and we are not
men, who will touch us? People were so naive. Oh, that’s all the communist propaganda what
you know, that is not true. Hitler is -- we know ge -- we know Germans. Germans were here in
the first World War, and they were not so bad, we can survive with it, and so he didn't want to

leave his [indecipherable] until the second day of the war. My mother packed his -- her bag.
They gave me a bag, a small bag, he gave -- she gave my brother a small bag and she told my
father goodbye. We are running, and you want to stay with your sister, stay. So he went with us.
But it was too late. It was too late. We went to the station, we found [indecipherable] train and
we went -- the train started to go, but then it were -- it was bombed. It -- it was a horrible story
with the train. [indecipherable] with the train was put on hold in the middle of the f -- the forest.
Stop it.

Beginning Tape Two

A: So, talking about a train that it stopped in -- in the middle of the forest, and I didn’t mention
that the train was full, people who were running from the Germans. A lot of them were soldiers
and officers from the Red army, Soviet army, with families. And the others were Jews, and
[indecipherable] communists who wanted to run from the fascists. But the civilian were mostly
Jews, and a small group of Lithuanian, yeah. So -- and the train was s-stopped before the old
border of Soviet Union because we were still on the occupied pass of the -- the Lithuanian
territory and the White Russia territory who belonged to Poland and was occupied by the
Germans as I told before, after the -- the -- after the war start with Poland. And so the train
stopped before the old Soviet border, and they -- the -- it was the -- the army who was -- the
Soviet army that -- not that -- it was the encoverdere army. It was not KGB, but it was a part of
it, like. They told everybody has to leave the train, but that the women has to leave on the right
side of the train, and the military man with the families -- with their families on the left side.
Then they closed all the windows and the doors from the right side where we were standing.
They opened the doors for the left side, they let in the military men together with their families,
and that’s it. And they went. The train started to roll -- to go, and we started to cry and to ask and
to shout and to -- don’t leave us, and the train left. Then I looked around, the forest was full with
luggage. Nobody to-took the luggage, they throw out and the people didn’t know what to do,
they started to walk to the border. And I remember my father coming to the border, showed his
passport and told him that he was a -- a member already of a union, and that wa -- there are my
documents. No, no, you are spies. Everything na -- we were -- we didn’t have the passports of
the Soviet Union. We were not citizens of the Soviet Union, we were the citizens of the country
Lithuania, who was occupied by the Soviets, but they didn’t change the passports yet, the

citizenships yet. They couldn’t -- they didn’t let us in. Then we -- we made kilometers and
kilometers during the day. We walked -- it was such a hot summer like -- like this summer, 1941
summer was very hot. And I remember my mother and -- complained that she cannot walk so
long in that. And then at night we came to a place and we found a house open and empty already,
no people. So we -- my father decided we have to rest there. We came in together with another
family, and in the middle of the night came a peasant, a Polish peasant, or a White Russian
peasant, I don’t know, and said you have to run, because there are German parachutists already
here. So you have to run. So the other family took the -- the bag, they -- one bag of -- of -- the
light bags because the big bags were left behind. So, and they run. And my father, like a
mathematician, he told, look, if it’s true that there are Germans all over here, so it’s
[indecipherable] to run. If it’s not true, so we will start in the morning, we have to rest. And that
was too late already. When -- in a war, every minute counts. The other family found a -- a bus
and they were safe. And they survived the war. I met them after the war, that was -- yeah. And
we were caught by the Germans. And that’s it, and we decided to go back.
Q: How -- how were you caught by the Germans?
A: In the morning we went farther and we entered a small village. We found there a Jewish
family who let us come in and have a little bit water, a tea, I don’t remember even if it was food.
No, I don’t remember, it was a horrible time. And -- and suddenly the Germans come -- came in
with -- on tanks and motorcycles and they occupied the village, and at once started the pogrom.
Pogrom. The neighbors came and took over everything from the -- from the people who -- who
allowed us to stay, and our things also, our belongings that -- our belongings were three small
bags, like. And that’s it, and it was finished. Then the Germans took my brother to dig some
holes, I don’t know, they took him. And they told my mother that they will -- he will come back

in two hours or something. We waited for two hours and he didn’t come back so my mother went
to them. It’s interesting that the roles of my father and my mother changed immediately when the
war started. She started to be the head of the family, not my father. She was -- before the war, he
was the head of the family, he was the person who brought that money to -- to the family, yeah,
supported the family, and she was a quiet lady, who loved books, to read a lot, and during the
night even. And that [indecipherable]. The roles chan -- changed. She started to be energetic,
started -- concentrated and her German. Her German was her mo -- her mother tongue, of course.
And she went to the Germans and they gave her the -- my -- back the brother -- the hale -- son.
She came back together with him, and she told, we have to go back home. Here we are strangers
from -- nobody knows us and -- and -- and he -- and it was a long walk home. I don’t remember
who told us don’t go through the forest because you will be ar -- killed by the people, or the
peasants there. You will be robbed, you will be killed and so on. So they decided to go along the
highways. So the German army was approaching, going deep to Russia, and we were going back
to Lithuania to Wilna. Perhaps it’s interesting, it was a false -- f-first front of the Germans. They
were soldiers, it was Wehrmacht. They didn’t do any harm to us. First of all, they didn’t know
who we are. They know that we are people who are -- run from them, but they didn't know we
were Jews or non-Jews, or -- and sometimes they threw us cigarettes, what my father was -- he --
he couldn’t bear not to smoke, he was a smoker, and he -- it was like better than bread for him.
Yeah. And sometimes we went through a village, so they ask for water, so there were people
who didn’t allow us in to take water. To come over and to take water. No food, no water.
Q: How long were you there for?
A: I think it was there two weeks, probably. I remember only one old lady, a peasant, asked us to
come in, and she gave us bread and milk. But it was unusual for us. Very unusual. She told, “My

son is on the front fighting with the Germans, I don’t know where he is, so maybe another family
will give him some bread.” Then we came home. Of course, Wilna was occupied already for 10
days, or -- or -- I don’t remember the day we came back, don’t remember. And the lady th -- was
-- who lived with us --
Q: Julia?
A: Julia was home, and she welcomed us, yeah. She was happy and pride [indecipherable]. Yeah.
It’s a lot to -- to tell. The first was my brother, what my brother did, he wrote a letter to Rachel.
And the only person who walked through the st -- streets was me. So he gave me the letter.
Rachel accused me that I probably read the letter, but I don’t remember if I read it or not. I don’t
think so.
Q: Why were you the only one that walked through the street?
A: The men didn’t dare to walk the street, because it was very dangerous, they would be caught.
My mother didn’t want it, so it just left me. I was 13 years old, and I went and pe -- we were in
another district, absolutely far from Rachel. I had to go through all the city, and the -- the most
dangerous, I thought, dangerous place was a bridge, to cross a bridge because soldiers were
already standing there and guarding the bridge, the Germans soldiers of course, and I -- I
remember coming over, saying mm-hm, [indecipherable] ask you for documents or not. I
decided to jump on one foot, like playing.
Q: Skipping.
A: I was thir -- yeah -- I was 13 years old, why not? I jumped -- I jumped through the bridge.
And they looked at me and smiled. Then I run. Run again to her house. Now I have to bring back
-- a letter back from her to my brother.
Q: What was their reaction when you got to the house?

A: Don’t remember. I was so overwhelmed with the danger to cross city, that I don’t re -- I think
she was happy and unhappy at the same time. [indecipherable]
Q: How was the city different? You described the bridge, but as you walked through it, what --
h-how could you feel the presence of the Germans?
A: Well, they were all over the streets, the soldiers and their ve-vehicles, their cars and tanks,
and -- o-over the street, so it was not difficult to -- to see it. And then I think my mother -- yeah,
my mother told me to go to her cousin, to visit her cousin. And -- and I -- I almost
[indecipherable] caught in their apartment already mixing something up, maybe it was then the
Soviets were in Wilna. I don’t remember who was -- the police was there, and searching their
apartment. And I was afraid that they will not allow me to go back. And I don’t remember it was
the germa -- Germans or the Russians. Don’t remember exactly, because they were rich people.
We were not rich, we were middle class [indecipherable] middle class, and you know, but they
were rich people, so I don’t remember who searched the apartment, but tha-that was the moment
I was scared that I will not be able to go back home.
Q: So your mother let you out?
A: Yeah, all the time. All the time, I don’t know, all the time. It was -- we had a Polish lady we
were very friendly with. She was a p-poor lady, she was a relative of the German lady who lived
with us. It means, this German lady was married to her brother. The brother was a -- a Russian
officer in Russia, and was killed in ninet -- in -- in the first World War. So she was alone and she
came back to our family. And we loved the lady his Veronica, what I gave the name to the Yad
Vashem, her name. And I am talking about it. It’s interesting. I am. So she told me after the war
why my mother was so sure that I will survive. Nobody di -- what -- happens to me. It was -- she
had a dream when she gave birth to me. After she gave -- gave birth, she was tired, of course,

and she fell asleep. And she had a dream that the angel came to her and told her that when your
daughter will be 13 years old, it will be a war in which your whole family will be killed, perish,
all but not your daughter. She will survive it. So she was sure that -- and you know, she was so --
she was thinking about the -- the dream all the time, but I didn’t know it, a-as I told you, I -- I
knew it after the war, I learned it from Veronica. That why she insisted she wanted to emigrate
so much, and that why she was so nervous. And Veronica told me even that she wanted to
commit suicide in 1939, but she persuaded her not to leave the children. And she committed
suicide.
Q: Your mother?
A: Yeah, in 1943, when the Germans took her. She told me the Germans will not take me alive.
They can take me only a dead body, and that what she did.
Q: So wh-what is day to day life like at this point? I-It sounds like people are staying inside.
A: Yeah.
Q: Have the Germans instituted rules, are you wearing a star at this point?
A: No, no, it was not like tha -- bef -- before we went to ghetto it was no stars, but it was very
dangerous to walk the street, especially the men. Even the Poles didn’t walk a lot, it was only the
military men and Lithuanian.
Q: What did you do all day?
A: I don’t know. I don’t remember. Probably we read. It’s a good question, you know. It was like
a -- a prison, but at home. Of course my, the -- the Julia used to go out and to buy some food. It
was a shortage o-on food already. I don’t remember her -- doing something, you know, what my
brother did. And of course we had neighbors. We rented one apartment. It was one house with a
lot of rooms, but after my grandparents came home, back to Wilna, after the revolution started in

Russia. So when they -- they died, this -- in -- in Wilna, so my mother rented a part of the house.
It was a Polish family there, and my mother was helping them a lot. When the Lithuanian came,
they fired all the Poles from the [indecipherable] positions. And he was working for the railroad,
so he was fired also because he didn’t know Lithuanian, the language, so they fired him. So they
couldn’t pay for rent, and they couldn’t -- and they didn’t have money and my mother told them
they can stay as long as they want, she will not ask them for rent. Ah, so, but when the war
started with the Germans so, and suddenly somebody told that the Germans are going from hou -
- home to home looking for Jewish men. So she asks them to hide my father and my brother and
they refused. Yeah, but -- but we -- we were not sure why they refused, maybe they were afraid
of theirsel -- themself being o-of the Germans also, yeah. But the Germans didn’t come to our
house, and it was see, then on September, first of September then, they told all the Jewish people
to go to get -- to the ghetto. And they already know the Germans, but the Lithuanian police went
from home to home for -- ho -- one Jewish house, another Jewish house, to take the Jewish
people out of the houses.
Q: Before we get to that, I just want to clarify that -- so then was the bombing of Vilnius by the
Germans, was that in August of the same year?
A: It was a -- an -- the -- it was June.
Q: Oh, it was June.
A; June, yeah. The war started the 22" of June, 1941. June, I think, not July yet, June.
Q: And so then that was -- you tried to run and you came back, that took about two weeks --
A: Yeah.
Q: And then so from about mid June until --
A: No, July, for about --

Q: Okay, July.
A: -- mid July until the first of September, this --
Q: You were just sort of in this prison state.
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: Okay. Did you have any idea that something might be happening in the last days of August?
Do -- could you tell that maybe you were going to be -- some sort of form of action was going to
be taken? Did you seek preparations in the ghetto, or --
A: Well, we didn’t know, because it happened, I think, overnight.
Q: Okay.
A: They decided which part of the streets we -- will belong to the ghetto. It was a Jewish district,
so not a lot of non-Jews lived there, so they asked the non-Jews to -- to find another -- other
apartments and the Jews they took to th -- to the prison, and then to Ponary and they killed them.
And so they emptied a whole district, so they could take the -- from the other districts of the city
and bring it to -- to the streets who -- which belonged to th -- to the ghetto already. But maybe
rumors ki -- were going, of course around that it will be a ghetto organized, because people knew
that they organized the ghetto in other cities probably. I don’t know, I don’t remember. I know
only that we knew that some would -- prominent Jews were arrested and killed. Some Jewish
men were taken from apartments and from the streets. We knew that the -- the Lithuanian were
helping them, and the Lithuanian police, they organized Lithuanian police, and the fascist
[indecipherable] of Lithuania of course was [indecipherable]. And th-the Poles were -- behaved
very quietly, they were afraid for themself. And you have to remember that the Germans were
enemies of the Polish people, because they conquered their country, they were destroying their
country, and they killed a lot of Poles over. So it was like -- a little bit it’s your enemies and our

enemies are the same, so it was like that. Had to say, oh, like a moral support from the side of the
Poles. Not all of them, was a part of them were very happy to see it, and participated in it,
participated in it, but a lot of them were -- hated the Germans and --
Q: Was your mother making any sort of prep -- preparations, perhaps gathering up jewelry,
maybe packing a bag that would definitely go if you had to go anywhere’? What wa --
A: I think so, yeah, because perba -- probably rumors were already around the city that the ghetto
will be organized, and when they started to see how they are throwing out the people, the Jewish
people from the houses, so my mother started to pack. But it’s interesting we were in the last
one, because Germans didn’t know that our house is Jewish. We didn’t look like -- the look was
like -- I don’t know, something. And th -- and y -- every house had a -- such a -- a -- how to call
it? A sign, which -- the names of all the tenants. So our name, last name, is a German name,
Shreyber. A lot of Germans have Shreyber. It -- in German, this is a writer. And my father’s
name in Polish was not Matthias, but it was Mateush, and my mother names -- my mother’s
name is Valentina. And my was -- and my brother’s is Jusef in Polish, yeah. And my, Sulamita,
the only -- the only Hebrew name, but it’s such an -- it was not a popular name, so they didn’t
know what name is it. And then the go -- went to the tenants, the Polish, Latinsky, Latinska and
so on. So they -- we saw them coming in to our yard and reading the sign and [indecipherable].
So ’m coming in again, somebody else, reading, and [indecipherable]. So we were very nervous,
what -- we didn’t know what to do. And -- but somebody told them, yeah, yeah, go, there are
Jews there. So I remember they knocked at the door, Lithuanian policemen, and my mother
opened the door, and they saw my mother and said, oh, I’m sorry, it’s a mistake. So she told no,
it’s not a mistake, we are Jews. So he came in, and he asked for the pas -- passports, for the
documents, and he started to write name. Then he looked out -- around -- my father looked -- I

will show you the picture. It was an -- a -- a look of a Russian intelligent [indecipherable] you
know -- you have to know the Russian intelligent, how they -- they looked, like Chekhov, like,
you know. He looked my -- my mother was absolute not Jewish look, and me. So he told, look,
you can’t change the nationality in the documents. You don’t have the names, the Jewish names,
you don’t have the last name Jewish -- a Jewish one. What are you thinking how -- and it was
such a shock for us. And I remember my father looking at my mother, and -- and she told no, we
will go where -- wer -- where our people go, together with them. And we went. Because, you
know, even if she allow him, okay, okay, maybe you can help pass -- to change, because it was
not so easy to change in passport the name, you change to -- and there’s a nationality, to change
like you cannot recognize it, it’s changed, you know? It’s very difficult, we didn’t know who can
read, and then the neighbors would say, look why didn’t you take them, what is it with you?
They are Jews. So we decided to go with [indecipherable] we went, we took some -- yeah, we
took some belongings with me -- with us.
Q: After that decision was made, did your father and mother discuss it, or disagree about it?
A: No, absolutely not. We took our belongings and the only thing my mother told Julia, Julia,
this big bedroom where the children were, and the small room and the bathroom will belong to
you. I don’t know if they leave you the other rooms, yeah? And she wrote on the door her name,
Julia -- her maiden name was German, I don’t remember. And she wrote al -- under that,
volkesdeutsche. The Germans who were not in Germany, [indecipherable] but they were all in
Poland, in Lithuania -- they lived in Poland or Lithuania, they named them not Germans, but
volkesdeutsche. It’s deutsche is German, but volkes, it’s --

A: -- people, people -- German people, yeah. And she brought to the room as much belonging as
she could, then she saw that it’s too much, somebody can say what -- what is it. So she brought
to the neighbors a part of the belongings.
Q: The neighbors that wouldn’t help your father?
A: No -- yeah. She di -- y-you know, they couldn’t recognize already that they are not friendly to
us, because to hide a Jew was very -- very, very dangerous. So how can you accuse a person who
di -- doesn’t want to risk their own life? You cannot make such a big a -- you know, a-a-
accusation immediately. So she didn’t. She couldn’t understand it, she ment -- she said, oh yeah,
she was afraid, but yeah, and that’s it, then we went to ghetto -- to the ghetto, and started a new
life.

ga -- gate of ghetto, because other gates were -- other streets were closed, yeah. They build like
walls, and that it was a main gate and another gate was for the head of the -- of the ghetto,
special gate, a small gate, but he had the keys, and he could open and walk out, but he couldn’t.
So everybody was gathered in front of the main gate. So the Lithuanian police went through the
apartments and together with the Jewish police, and asked everybody to go out to the ghetto, to
people in the front of the -- of the gate, and then they went to search every apartment if
somebody was left there. And then I started to scream. What are we waiting? Are we waiting so
quietly to be shot? And I screamed and talked to my parents and talked, and a man was standing
behind and told my father, “Quiet down your daughter, otherwise I will quiet her down. What
she’s talking about? Nobody will kill us, they are checking our documents.” That was the -- they
always lied to -- to quiet the people down so the -- we are checking your papers, so you have to
line up and we will check your papers. I didn’t believe it. So my father told me I will give you a -
- my watch as a good [indecipherable] watch -- I’ll give you the watch, and give it to the
Lithuanian, and -- because they -- they was taking some money, and -- give it to the Lithuanian,

the side, yeah. So we stand here, and he was standing, father, and then a Lithuanian came over
and started to slap us back to there. So he told no, don’t touch them. So people saw that we are
standing there, so people started to run behind us, so our family was growing and we were
standing in the front and behind us some other people, some other people. And then they opened
the gate and all the people went -- left. We was -- we were already in the ghetto, standing in the
ghetto and waiting for the -- for [indecipherable] yeah. And then he told, the action is finished,
goodbye, and he left, and he went back. And then the -- so the Jewish police knew it, where other
people are -- are going. They told, oh, you save your life, you save your life. And then we heard
that everybody was taken to the prison, to Lukeeshki, and from the pris -- prison to Ponary and
everybody was killed. It was thousands and thousands of people. I don’t know -- I don’t
remember the number, but it was a lot. Maybe eight thousand, maybe 10 thousand. And then
some run away, people wounded from the, you know, graves, came to ghetto, smelling with dead
people already. Well, we knew already. And I told my mother, that’s it, 1 am not more going
together with you and waiting until they will shot me. [indecipherable] shoot me, they will kill
me. [indecipherable] to run. Every time it was a rumor, every time that we heard that it will be an
action, it will be something in ghetto. So every time I heard it in the morning, I was putting my
star of -- the David star, yeah in -- on the front only, I didn’t have it on -- on my back, and it was
not, you know, I -- it was with a needle --

A: Yeah.
Q: -- when you heard rumors.
A: Yeah.
Q: What did your mother say?
A: Okay. She was happy that -- so -- and then it was a problem. Her -- we were working -- the
Jewish people who worked the brig -- with the brigades, yeah, they were walking through the
streets, but not on the sidewalks, but in -- on the road. So it was one risk to take out the -- my
star, yellow star, to go to the sidewalk and to disappear. Not to take it. And I run though the --
through the town, to the city, to Veronica. And I stayed with her a couple of months.
Q: What did she say when you came to the door?
A: She was happy. But she was very poor, and she had only one room. And they -- her neighbors
liked to -- to talk to her, to come in and to have a chat, you know, they saw me. I couldn’t hide
myself, was one room. So she told everybody, oh my relative from -- from a village came to live.
Okay. They knew, but they pretend that they don’t know. And we used to walk with her. I used

Q: A Polish girl.

Q: So when you were staying with Veronica, what were the fears? Were they mostly of the
neighbors, or at that point would you be afraid that Germans might come searching house to
house?
A: The Lithuanian.
Q: The Lithuanians?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: That was -- and the -- the neighbors were friendly, except one, and this one started to talk that
Veronica is hiding a Jew. And then another neighbor came to us and told her, Veronica, you have
to do something, because she told, that the rumors are going like that, that you are hiding a
Jewish girl. So her mother, she had a -- she has a mo -- had a mother, a old mother, yeah, she
was also not very young, but so sh -- her mother started to cry, let me die in my bed, I don’t want
to be hanged by Germans -- by Lithuanian. If they would find me, they would kill both of them.
Was no question about it. She cried [indecipherable] because didn’t know what to do. So I

evening. She cried the whole w-way back. She told me if I can -- if I risk with my own life, it’s
okay, but I don’t want to risk with my mother’s life. And I -- I understood it. That’s it, it’s too

Beginning Tape Three

Q: Can you talk a little bit about how you began to work when you were in the ghetto? You
were, after all -- at that point how old were you?
A: Ah, 15 -- or 15 I was already in fo -- 1943, so -- and I started to work in 1942 probably, when
I was 14. But you know, because I was in and out of the ghetto, I didn’t have like a -- a real
serious wor -- job. But I don’t know who took me to Polish bricks. I -- they have to be polished, I
don’t know. So it was such a machine. It was red, not -- they were not very st -- very straight so I
had to polish them. My mother was very upset about it because it were a dust which goes -- went
to my lungs, and she was always afraid -- afraid of my lungs, because my aunt, her sister -- my
mother’s sister, died of tuberculosis.
Q: You were working with bricks?

Q: Okay. Making the bricks?
A: No, polishing them.
Q: Polishing the bricks?

but I don’t remember who took me, who asked me to do it, but I went to work for one time. And
then the evening I belonged to -- to a -- a youth club. You know, we tried to make the life more
or less normal, you know? As normal as could be. As close to normal as it could be. So we had a

club, and we had poets and writers, who taught us literature, Jewish literature, and we were
performing there, and I won even a -- a prize for a poem what I was reciting, yeah. Yeah -- re --
Q: A poem?
A: Yeah, a poem.
Q: What was the poem about?
A: It was a poem of -- an -- an old Yiddish p-poet, Ihoyash, that was his name. He is a famous
Yiddish poet -- Jewish poet, actually, not Yiddish. But he wrote in Yiddish. That -- and we were
-- it was like a close family, and the -- in the club, so I was so involved in performing something,
and -- so it was -- but it was a very short time, a short time what I told you, I don’t know, three,
four months that we were -- we had the life without the big, big action, without the killing
thousands of people. People were dying of starvation, of course, and -- and illnesses. People
were taken for that, or for another so-called crime. If you see as -- you are very hungry and you
steal a piece of bread, you were shot, you know. But like the actions, which were before, like the
actions with the yellow shines, with the pink shines, what -- thousands of people were killed. So
it was a short period, I think the end of ’42, or the beginning of the ’43, that it was -- I don’t
remember the date exactly, but it was more or less quiet. And we had even a school for students -
- everything was illegal, of course. The school was like we used to come and the teachers taught
us history, and literature, and mathematics. And I remember my father as a mathematic. He used
to -- he wanted to teach me mathematics, so he explained to me something, and I didn't listen
even to him. He asked me to repeat and I told him, I don’t know. So he thought, you are not
listening to me. So I told him, do you want me to -- to die a educated person? I don’t care. Well,
he stopped. Then the teacher of French language, yeah, I had a private less -- private lessons of
French before the war. So she was a neighbor of ours in the ghetto, so my mother used to ask me,

go to Eda Danielovna, go to her, she is so lonely, she already lost her husband and her daughter,
she is alone, go and talk to her French. Well, I thought, what ha -- why -- what do you want from
me? I can be killed without French. And I remember that only once I came to her and we talked,
and now I don’t know French. Now I kne -- I have to know French, but I don’t know now. That -
- my mother was clever that she wanted me to -- to, you know, not to forget the language, the
French language, and --
Q: How did your parents react when you spoke like that?
A: Nothing. They kept quiet. What could they tell? They never told me, you will survive,
because they didn’t know. Maybe my mother had, but I told you the dream, so she was hopeful --
she hopes that I will survive, but the life was -- it was so difficult to survive that -- I know that
my father closed the book and never came to me again. So, and the lessons at school were very --
you know, it was very upsetting because every day we used to see, oh another teacher is gone,
yeah. Oh, he died. Oh, this one was caught carrying a piece of bread and was taken to the prison.
Oh, this -- you know, every day, so it was so -- you know, upsetting that then we closed the
school at all. Let’s see, they forgot to tell you about a m -- the last days of the -- the last days of
the peace before the 90 -- the ra -- the war started in 1941 -- in 1941. So it was days very -- very
-- not quiet days, because the KGB were already -- start already to work very energetic in
Lithuania. Before they were -- they kept a little bit quiet, they let us leave normally, yeah. Then,
probably they felt already that it will be a war between Russia and Germany, so they started to
take people out to Siberia, that -- the people who they thought were enemies of Soviet Union.
Who were the enemies of the sov -- of Soviet Union? Of course, some parties, alexa -- Zionist
parties, Zionist parties and BUND, and -- and rich people. So but Wilna was a poor city at all,
and they didn’t -- in Wilna didn’t -- they didn’t have rich people, very rich people, I mean. So,

but in -- the Bolsheviks thought that everybody who has a small store was selling some
newspapers and some pencils and some salt and sugar, everything in one room, is rich. So they
used to take the people out of their homes and to take them to the railway station and to take
them to Siberia. Also peasants, Lithuanian peasants who had more than one cow, or one -- was
already like a kulak in -- in Russia. A rich peasant who is exploiting others, you know, so -- and
my mother was dreaming to run away from Wilna. So she was standing on the street in front of
our house, and asking them when they -- you know, they are -- the kb -- KGB was -- had the list
of names and was taking one -- from one house a family, from another one. Come to us, please,
we will -- we are rich, we are ri -- do you see, we have a house -- the house didn’t belong already
to us, but she told like that -- and a house, and na na na, and then come right in. We had normal
furniture, fi -- nice furniture. We -- we are rich, take us, take us to Siberia. And people thought
that she is crazy, what is it? I remember somebody asked me, is your mother crazy? And I, no.
So why she is asking them to take you to Siberia? Because it’s better than to take over the ger --
the Germans will take over us, yeah. And she was right. Mostly. Of course, not everybody
survived in Siberia also, of course not. I s -- it was a very hard time, it was a very hard time to
Russia at all, and it was a hard time to people in Siberia. But mostly they survived, and they
came back.
Q: Your mother tried awfully hard to -- to get out.
A: She tried very hard to -- to get out of the country, yeah, of Lithuania and the city of --
couldn’t. That’s it. Yeah, that’s what I missed these days. Then the war started, so you know
already that we are on our way too late, and we were caught, and we came back, and we came to
the ghetto, yeah.

Q: In -- in the ghetto, can you describe the -- the interactions that you did have with the
Germans? Where would you interact with them once you were in the ghetto? Was it just coming
in and going out, or --
A: No, it’s a -- it’s -- as I told you, when it was Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday, when they took
all the people, that what I survived, this action. The others actions I was not there in ghetto.
Q: Right.
A: I knew only that then it was a yel -- the action of the yellow -- yellow -- documents of the
yellow shine [indecipherable]. So I was with Veronica, and we knew that something is going on
in ghetto. And now of course I was very upset, and I didn't know what happened with my family.
So she told me, come, we will go th -- to this -- to the -- in the direction of the ghetto, maybe we
will learn something. And we went and we met a Jewish family, walking like that in the streets.
So we stopped them and started to talk to them, what’s going on? So they told me -- they told us
that it was the action of yellow documents, of yellow shines, and we have the -- the yellow
shines, so we were allowed to go and to go to our job where he was working. He was working
for Germans, I don’t know which organization, so he took his family and he went there. So I
didn’t know if my father had it, and I was so upset and we went farther, and we stayed -- I don’t
know which street we -- we were stopped by a crowd with -- the crowd was looking how they --
the Jews were going through the road to Ponary. And I was looking together, and I thought, my
God, why is there -- why is they are walking so quietly? Why is they not doing something, you
know? And I looked if my father or my mother -- my family is there. Couldn’t see it. But
suddenly I saw a woman carried a small child, and shud -- suddenly the Lithuanian were not so
close, the soldiers who took them, she throw the child to the crowd, and somebody took the child
and disappeared immediately. Understand? She throw to the crowd, to the Aryan crowd who

were standing, and probably a -- a -- a woman took the child and run away. But of course she
was afraid that somebody will stop her for taking, but nobody stopped her. She run away, she --
immediately she was gone. So the woman saved her child. It was horrible. I don’t remem -- then,
we went with her to that place where my son was working because my father was working in the
ghetto. And my --
Q: Or your brother?
A: My father, and my brother worked out of the ghetto, so we -- we went to he -- to see him.
Q: To see who?
A: My -- my brother.
Q: Okay, uh-huh.
A: And he -- I -- we -- we met him and he told that yeah, the family is okay.
Q: Really?
A: The family is okay. So, the family -- my father took Rachel as a daughter inste -- you know,
instead of me, because I was not there. And my brother took my cousin, my -- my father’s
sister’s daughter, as a wife.
Q: Dina?
A: D-Dina, yes. Dina Abramovich, yeah, who wer -- who is 90 now and works for the
[indecipherable] yeah. You know, because it was who had the yellow document, could take with
-- with them, a wife, and two children less than 16 years. So Rachel was already approaching 20,
but she looked so young. Everybody looked so thin, that you couldn’t understand she is 20 or 16
or fi -- 16 or 15, you know? So it was okay, and he took her, my cousin, she was much older than
he, but it went smooth, that’s it.
Q: But when you came back --

A: Yeah.
Q: -- then were y -- wh-whose paper were you on? If Rachel was on your father’s paper?
A: Nobody checked the paper then. They checked the papers when the actions were, you know,
but nobody checked the papers. Look, people are dying and running away and kill -- people were
kalled every minute. So who knows -- who knew? Where is my daughter and where is my
brother? Where is my father? Nobody checked it. And my father organized in the ghetto a small
school for -- like a technical school. And some use -- some young boys were attending the
school, and making some, you know -- I don’t -- I don’t know even what they produced. But I
know one thing, that the -- the underground was working already in ghetto and my -- my brother
was among them, who was stealing weapons from the Germans and was bringing to the ghetto.
And I know that the young people who are working in the school, the technical school were
repairing guns, making something like grenades, like to -- to -- you know --
Q: Grenades?
A: Grenades, yeah.
Q: Uh-huh. Handmade grenades?
A: Yeah, yeah. We used to, you know, the bulb -- to take a bulb --
Q: A light bulb?
A: -- from -- yeah, a lamp, yeah. To take everything from inside, to put a liquid, which is --
which can be inflamed immediately when you throw it, the glass will, of course, break, and it
will, like a bomb, you know, it will burst. So that was our grenades in ghetto, yeah.
Q: Your -- so they were making these in your father’s technical school?
A: Yeah, yeah, they were [indecipherable]
Q: So your father’s technical school wasn’t just a school?

A: He -- I -- I don’t know, he pretended it was a school, you know, it was very -- everything was
very [indecipherable]. There they made fels -- like they made keys to -- to the gate. Like, the gate
was closed, locked always, yeah. Only when people were going out to work or coming in from
work. So they made keys to -- to ca -- to be able to walk out at night, to the partisan, to the
woods, you know? And it was not from the gate, from the main gate, but it was another gate, a
small one, what I told you for the -- the leader of the ghetto, who would walk out. He had a
personal gate, a personal key, and he could walk out with a key -- through the small gate. His
name was Genz.
Q: Jacob Genz?
A: Jacob Genz.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: He had a -- a Lithuanian wife, and a daughter who wa -- out of ghetto, of course. And he was
allowed to come to them to visit them sometimes, you know. So he had his key, and so then the
partisans used it, and probably Genz knew about it, I think. So it was very, very difficult to hide,
and he knew about the -- that the party -- the underground party existed, yeah, and the
[indecipherable] was named.
Q: Were you part of that underground?
A: Yeah, you know, I was a part of it, but I was small -- no, y -- I was too young, and we were
only like some, you know, listen to some news from Russia, what’s going on in the front, how
the Germans are already retreating, and to encourage people that soon, soon, soon, that will be
the end of the war, and th -- you know, so we were listening to the news, writing down and then
giving it to read for people, and so this was not exactly a big job, and --
Q: But you did that?

A: Yeah, yeah, we did. And -- and we, of course, I hope that they will take me to the partisans,
cause I -- I -- I didn’t look like a Jewish girl and I could go to the fr -- from the forest to the city
and back. I had such -- we had to have a connection, so somebody had to come to the city and go
back to -- to the forest, so -- but they decided that I am too young, and they left me behind, me
and Rachel, also.
Q: Who -- who left you behind?
A: The organizers of the -- of the -- of the underground organization.
Q: Was your brother involved?
A: My brother was involved in the -- of course, yes, he used to steal and bring weapons. But he
was caught before -- before the liquidation of the ghetto. He was caught in the action of men, and
it was -- they were -- before they liquidated the ghetto, they were catching only men, so he was
caught and transferred to the -- the concentration camp in Estonia, in Klooga.
Q: Can you tell us about that, that day that he was caught?
A: It was a day when the organization mobilized all the members, and decided to -- to fight the
Germans, decided to resist, it’s enough, you have to resist. And we were mobilized on one street
in a -- in a big, big yard of the -- of the house where the partisans probably had the weapons, I
don’t know. I don’t know exactly because we -- we were not -- I was not told where and what
they have. One group of the underground fighters were sent to another house, and they had to
start to fight the Germans, who were entering -- the Germans and the Lithuanians who were
entering the -- the ghetto. And another group of only boys and my -- they include my brother
were sent to another street, and -- but they went without weapons and they were told that the
weapons were being delivered. And they were not delivered and the Germans surrounded them
and they took them, all of them, the whole group. And the -- the people who were in fron -- in

the front house, saw it was foolish, they were told that it will be a parole when they start to shout
-- to shoot the Germans, so it was a parole fire. But fire is in German also. You know what fire?
Fire is a fire, you know? It -- so it’s -- and the Germans walked through the streets and somebody
asked for a cigarette probably, give me the fire or something. They had fire, they started to
[indecipherable]. And they did -- and the Germans, they -- around to the -- the base, to the f -- to
the house, that the people from the house couldn’t see them, yeah. And they put a bomb there
and they run away and the whole house was exploded and all the people were -- were -- died, of
course. Were killed.
Q: So ri -- the people in the resistance in the ghetto were waiting for an order to shoot, and they
got -- they got a mixed up order and they shot accidentally?
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: And then the Germans bombed the building?
A: Yeah.
Q: Where were you during all of this?
A: And I was in another -- well, in the sam -- the same street, but oh, maybe three or four houses
from there, yeah.
Q: So -- so you saw this?
A: I didn’t see it, but I heard it, of course. And then -- then the organization, the head of the
organization decided there is no reason to fight. We have to leave ge -- the ghetto to go -- you
have to rent to -- to go to the partisans and to fight the -- the Germans from the woods. But was it
a right decision? But the decision has to be done much earlier. And to take much more people to
the partisans because we were so afraid that the Germans can learn about the organization, that it
was very, very -- it was a conspiracy, very, very underground, and nobody knew it except the

members of the organization. But we could involve more -- more young people. And the other
tha -- thing is, they took only -- to the woods they took only people who had a pistol, or a -- a
gun, or something like that. Who had no weapons they didn’t want it. So we didn't -- I had --
didn’t have it, and -- and Rachel didn’t have it, so we were la -- left behind, and that what is it.
Q: So how did you find out where Joseph was taken to?
A: Joseph was so capable that he send us a -- a small letter that the man who -- the machinist of
the train, the man who was -- how you say? You know, somebody has to sit there, and to --
Q: The conductor?
A: Conductor, yeah, but it’s not like a conduc -- okay, the conductor was a young Polish guy,
and my brother wrote a note that I am taking to a concentration camp to Estonia, and please save
Rachel. He was so thinking about her, that that was his -- yeah. And the guy, I don’t know how, I
don’t remember how, he brought a letter to the ghetto -- oh he, or somebody else brought it, but
we -- we had it, and we knew that they were there. And my father told me that you cannot run
away without Rachel, because my son asked me to save Rachel. Okay. So, when it was the
liquidation of the ghetto, on the 23" of September, 1943, so we were -- the ghetto was
surrounded already by Lithuanian police, and -- and I think even with po -- no, the -- I think
mostly Ukrainian police, because the Lithuanian police, the Lithuanian SS actually knew already
that the Russians are coming, and they run to the forest with another group of partisans, what
they claim now that they were the patriots. Okay, maybe, but I don’t know which patriot they
were, but -- so they run to the forest to fight the Russians, of course, because they wanted to help
the Germans, but the Germans wanted to mobilize them to go to the army and to fight the
Russian [indecipherable]. They didn’t want it, so they didn’t obey the Germans, but they wanted
to fight Russians, so they run to the forests. And of course they were afraid that if some Jews

were alive, so they were going to tell that -- what -- what was going on there. So I think that the -
- the liquidation of the g-ghetto in Wilna was by a Ukrainian SS division, made by Ukrainians,
because I remember standing with Rachel in line already, hearing them talking Russian. Russian,
or Ukrainian, it’s very similar, you know, you can recognize, you can understand. And we --
when we understood that we cannot go out together with the organization, underground
organization, cannot leave the ghetto, we started to look for a exit, how to run. We met some
other girls. We were sitting a couple of hours in a -- you know, the places where the -- the water
is running from the toilets.
Q: The sewer?
A: Yeah.
Q: Tunnel, or sewer?
A: In such a -- yeah. So we s-sat there until it was dark, then we went out, and --
Q: You were hiding?
A: Yeah, hiding, but for several hours, we didn’t want to hide it for -- forever, we couldn’t. It
was like sitting like that, and it was not -- not only comfortable, but was impossible to sit long
there. And -- and it was in ghetto, at -- you know, and we wanted to go out. So we walked out,
the ghetto was -- looked terrible. There are no people already in the ghetto. It was dark already,
with the -- the windows were open, the doors were open, the belongings were in the streets, you
know. The pillows were torn apart, all the feathers. Like, I see the -- the picture like today, you
know, like it was yesterday. And n-near us was a library, a big library, a [indecipherable] library.
So the books were out in the streets, torn and -- you know. And we looked for people, you know,
so we met three o-other girls, so we were five of us. And we decided to go to climb the stairs
upstairs in a building. And I know -- I don’t know how we knew that the building has a hole in

the roof, and we can go out to -- onto the roof, and from the roof we can jump to another
building which doesn’t belong already to the ghetto. So it was dark, and we couldn’t see well,
but we saw the hole in the roof, and one of the girls climbed the ladder, and she was the first who
looked out, and she was caught. So, a soldier was [indecipherable] there and watching. She was
caught, and she shouted so loudly that we ran back. I remember not finding the way out of there.
You know, the building, it was dark, where are the stairs, where are -- where is [indecipherable]
run back. And then -- then we s -- we saw no way out. And we went to the building of the
Judenrat, I mean like the government of the ghetto [indecipherable]. And we found this Jewish
police and the government [indecipherable] and some people were there. And we -- we came to
them. So the next day, we were taken together with the poli -- Jewish police and everybody.
Taken to the same place where the old people were taken already [indecipherable] and old, old
cemetery, what Rachel told you, called Rosa, and -- and then I wa -- I met my mother. She --
when she saw me she was surprised, and so upset, and I couldn’t describe you the -- you know, I
can’t describe you the -- her face. She was so sure that I’Il run away. She was so sure that I will
survive, you know? And that was her only hope. And then they started to let out the people one
by one, and to select them, one to the right, one to the left, one to the right, one to the left. And
we saw that to the left, they are pushing the old people and children, and handicaps. It -- it means
they are sending them to death, that we know already. To the right, only young people. And I
remember that when I -- I think Rachel wer -- we walked out the first and she was sent to the
right. I was the next and my mother was behind me. And he ask me -- like I was 15 years old,
maybe I w-was tall, and he thought maybe I am older, but he ask me, “Are you alone?” I told no,
no. So he -- he want to push me to the left, and I told, “Yes, I am alone.” And he pushed me to
the right. And my mother, he didn’t push her, she went immediately to the left. And I stopped

her, cried, “Ma, Ma.” She -- she didn't look at me. That was the last time I saw her. She told us
that she went together with -- with my father. They walked out of the ghetto together, but they
separated the men from the women, so she didn’t know where my father is. And Rachel’s sister
decided go together as a child and with the family, both sisters. They were young, they went
together. And I didn't go with my mother. It was hard fo -- to me, but you know. It was a time
when I ask myself why I didn’t go with my mother, and then I was protecting myself and saying,
oh but my mother was -- would be even more unhappy if she saw me together with her, dying.
And it was only good for the Germans. More Jews are dying, it’s better for them, so why I
shouldn’t do it? Okay, maybe I’m right, maybe not, but I did it. Th-The moment I didn't think
about it, I protected my life. So they gathered all the people from the left side, and they send to
Majdanek immediately to the gas chambers. They were not even in the concentration camp, not
one day. From the train they took them to the gas chambers immediately. And one person from
the whole -- I don’t know how many thousand people were there, because so many thousands
were already killed, but I don’t know how many. But one person was run away. And she -- she
was a -- a wi -- a wife of a engineer who worked with my father. When I came back, she came
back to Wilna after the work -- after the war, and she learned that I am in hospital right after the
war. So she came to me to hospital -- to the hospital, and she told me that your mother was not
killed, your mother committed suicide. So I told her I know, because my mother told me, I have
the pills, they will not kill me. So she committed suicide in the car already -- in the train, on the
train. She committed suicide and my husband, who was not a husband yet, but the hu -- the
husband’s mother -- my husband’s -- in the future he was my --

A: Yeah, my future husband’s mother and his aunt. The aunt was -- worked for a pharmacy and
she gave them the pills. Three of them together committed suicide. So that was -- that how I
learned how my m -- mother died. And we were taken to a train, and when we went to the train, I
asked Rachel to run. Come, come. I told her, as soon as we are out of the country, and I'll not
know another language, I’1l not run away. I know the language here, I can communicate with the
people, I can run. She was not used to run. It was a -- it was a -- really not so easy to decide it.
She told me, we will maybe meet my -- my brother in the concentration camp, she couldn’t. And
one --
Q: Joseph?
A: Yeah, Joseph. And one of our girls told wi -- and wa -- that one woman Hiah Shapiro
[indecipherable] she is now in Israel, she told us, girls, I’m running. And she immediately took
from -- from our row to the sidewalk, to a house. I didn’t know that it was the house where she
lived, and she disappeared, and she survived. She found a way to the woods. It was not so easy
everything, it was not, but she was in the partisans, and then she -- she run to the
[indecipherable] Europe. In 1945 she went to -- through Poland, through Hungary, through Italy,
on -- il -- illegal to Palestine.
Q: So you wanted to run?
A: But I didn’t, because I couldn’t run by myself. I had to run with Rachel. That was my father’s
last words to me. Don’t run without Rachel. Then many years passed and I thought, how could
he tell a child of 15 years such a thing, such a warning? It was a matter of life and death, and
that’s it. And we were taken -- we were taken to the train station, to the train and when -- and
went to Latvia, to Kaiserwald, then from Kaiserwald to Stutthof. Not to Stutthof, to Strassenhof.
There we stayed for the -- more or less a year, and we were working for the [indecipherable]

were sure that it’s Ponary. So they brought us to the place where they shoot the Jews, yeah? So
we were waiting and waiting when the door will be opened. I don’t know if they stopped there,
or in another place. If they stopped it deliberately to make us, you know, so -- it’s like to --
morally to -- to f -- to destroy us morally.
Q: To weaken you, really.
A: Yeah. Oh, we were weak -- already weakened. Already. But -- and then the train went on and
we suddenly stop -- stopped -- I don’t know how long we went. The whole day, I think, until the
next night. I think we went -- we were on the train the whole day, and until in the middle of the
night, opened the doors, and we -- we saw big lamps like a -- like that, how it’s called --

A: -- reflector more.

absolutely. We were in the dark the whole time, and suddenly so much light, yeah. And the dogs
barking, and we couldn’t see even where we are, and who are around us. There were SS men,
these big dogs, you know, how they used to do it. And they were shouting at us, raus, raus,

faster, faster, faster. Go, go. And then we were putting in a -- in a row everybody and letting into
a concentration camp. We saw there the gates and we understood that it’s a concentration camp.
That’s how we came to the concentration camp. And then for tomorrow, we went out in the
morning, we went out to a appelle. I mean --
Q: Roll call.
A: Yeah, we had to -- to show up, everybody has to show up ina -- in -- to stand in a row straight
like soldiers, you know? And we were told to -- to give every jewelry we have, or money, or
watches, everything what’s valuable to give them immediately. If they find it, is, you know, there
is one sentence, death, death, death, yeah? So people gave what they had. And they were taking
such a -- like a -- like a ba -- big bag, and everybody was putting something in there, gold rings,
or something what was left. I think Rachel had something from my mother. My mother took with
her what was left from the jewelry Veronica didn’t sell, something, a brooch, I think, she took
with her, and she gave to Rachel something, and Rachel threw it in the toilet. So they were not
so, you know, excited [indecipherable] the Germans, they took the toilet out, you know, it was
not a toilet where you wash the -- with the -- with the water, yeah, the toilet, you flush it. No, it
was a toilet like a -- a [indecipherable] where you are --
Q: [indecipherable]
A: Yeah. And so they took it and they checked it. They fished from there some what do you
send, rings or something, and we were laughing at that. It’s a good job for a German soldier.
That was it. Then --
Q: Rachel threw it on purpose into the toilet?

Q: W-Wasn’t that a dangerous thing to do?
A: No. Who can -- who can know, who can point her out that she did it?
Q: Okay.
A: And there were like mountains of sand, so people put it in the sand.
Q: Their jewelry?
A: Their jewelry. So they took it from the sand. They knew everything. But there are -- there
were brave people who took it from other people to save it, and saved it, and nobody searched
us. They were so sure that we are so afraid that we will not hide it. So -- but I remember that a
acquaintance of mine, when we came already to another concentration camp she had it. She
thought I took it. That’s [indecipherable]

A: Some jewelry, she took it in from other people.
Q: Right.
A: She asked. The people gave it to her.
Q: At that point, how did you feel? Did you feel brave?
A: No. I don’t know. I -- I didn't think to do it, I -- I didn’t -- it was not in my mind to do
something -- some -- such brave things. I son -- I think my bravery I left in Wilna. I was not
brave any more. | think so, but maybe. And then we were taken to -- to Strassenhof. It was a
concentration camp, but it was more a labor camp, I think, because everybody was working. So it
was not so bad. Comparing with ghetto, it was bad. Comparing to the other concentration camp,
it was not so bad, you know? Bad things are like th -- bad things have stages. Can be bad, be bad,

it can be more bad, and even more bad. So there was the stages, so we were there, and at once we
worked for a -- we -- they were building some -- something, a building, a factory, so we worked
there. I don’t remember even what we did. Did we dig something, we -- we -- did we take -- use -
- used to take breaks and bra -- bricks, and --
Q: Bricks.
A: -- and bring it to them? Or we -- I don’t remember exactly what job we did. We helped the
Latvian people to build it. We were -- we were doing the dirty job for -- you know, the heavy
job, the dirty job for the builders. And one man who was working there, started to talk to me in
Russian -- because we didn’t know Latvian, it was a strange country for us. It was in not -- it was
similar to Lithuanian, but we didn't know Lithuanian even very well. We didn’t know. So he
started to talk Russian and we talked to him also, you know. He asked for -- where we are
coming from and so on. And he -- one day he brought even food, I think. And one day he told
me, I’Il -- Pll bring you clothes, and you will run away. We were already in the cl -- given the
clothes of the concentration camp, like stripes, you know? St-Striped clothes, yeah.
Q: Uniforms.
A: Uniforms. You can say uniforms, can -- maybe it is uniforms. I -- I think a uniform is a
uniform, it isn’t -- something isn’t, but here -- okay. But prisoner uniforms, okay, we’ ll say like
that. And he told me I’ll bring you one and I’1l show you how to run away, and I will bring you
to the partisans. And I came and I don’t know if I told Rachel or I told her later, and I thought
what to do, what to do? Can I trust him, or he will take me immediately to Gestapo, because
there were such things. But I -- I -- I think now that I could trust him, because there were things
that -- in Lithuania some people were asking for money, and then they were -- you -- o-or they
will hide you or take you to a good place.

Beginning Tape Four

A: Yeah, so -- so we were in Strassenhof, we were for a year, more or less.
Q: Can I get you to finish that story, what made you dis -- what did you decide about the offer
from the man?
A: Uh-huh, yeah.
Q: The -- the Latvian man.
A: Yeah, so I -- I was afraid to believe him, and then I was afraid another thing. The thing is that
if you run away, they will find it out very easily because they counted us every day in the
morning, and every day in the evening. They knew exactly the number of the prisoners. So they
will shot their closest. It means Rachel would be shor -- shot, that for sure. And sh -- not she --
not only she. So I thought no, I cannot do it. That’s it. I don’t remember telling her. I-I think in --
in -- I didn’t tell her in concentration camp for -- about it. It was out of my mind. And then we
were taken to a f -- to the [indecipherable] manufacturer -- to a factory, and we worked there
together with the Latvian people. The Latvian woman taught us how to manage the machines,
and she almost left it for us. We were already doing it. We’re happy that we can do such a job,
but it was of course, difficult for us, because everybody would -- had to take care of 10 machines
or something like that. But then we learned from her, we looked how she was stealing the
material, yeah, and we learned from her. She was not afraid of us.
Q: The Latvian woman?
A: The Latvian woman, so she was stealing, so Rachel told, we can do the same and we can sell
it, and we can -- I mean sell to get bread for it. And that we were r-risking the life for sure. So
one of us, me, and other times she, was cutting the roll. You have to be very careful how you cut
the roll, not to leave the sign. But I think that the people who ah -- were checking --

Q: Mmn-hm.
A: -- checked the -- the [indecipherable] material, you know, the rolls. You are bringing to a
place where it was checked, measured probably, knew about that, that the Latvian are doing it.
And they were afraid to tell it, because they probably didn't want to -- to threaten the Latvian
people who were working with us. They didn’t think that the Jewish women can dare to do it. I
believe it.
Q: If you cut it, where would you put it?
A: I put it like that, behind, and then Rachel run to the toilet, and she was look --
Q: Wrapped in a towel?
A: -- wrapping it around her waist. We were very thin, that you cannot find it [indecipherable]
you didn't look fat after [indecipherable]. Of course it was not a lot, maybe a couple of meters.
Q: But then who would you sell it to?
A: We work -- you know, because we were in touch with Latvian, some of the prisoners were
from Riga, and they spoke Latvian. So they had a connection with the inner -- ou-out -- the world
outside the concentration camp. See, they used to take it -- in the concentration camp, they used
to take it to bring it to the Latvian, and the Latvian gave them a bread, and they used to take
some bread for themselves, some bread to us. So that makes us more happier. I mean, we were
hungry, very hungry, because the food was very -- this was very little food there. Rations were
very small. A small piece of bread and a little bit margarine and some soup, like waterish --
watery soup, like water with some beans in it or something like. So we were very hungry, so this
was a support, a big support.
Q: Rachel talked about you wanting to eat your bread all up in the morning.

A: Ah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Every time we received the bread, I told give it my -- give my bread to
me. She told no, Pll not give it to you. Give it to me, I’m hungry, give it to me, I want to eat it.
No, you will not eat it. Pll give you a piece and that’s it, that’s your breakfast. 1 am hungry. You
will get the other one in the evening. And that save us the life. I don’t know how she knew it, or
maybe she learned it from somebody, maybe the instinct, you know, told her to -- to -- not to eat
it immediately the whole bread and then to be out of food the whole day, what was very bad, of
course.
Q: In the concentration camp, or when you worked, were there ever -- did you ever have an
experience where a German seemed sympathetic or helpful?
A: No, it was a -- you know, we were punished for si -- for some things, you -- we used to come
to the concentration camps so they used to -- we used to stand in lines, they used to count us and
then we were punished for something. Somebody did something wrong and we were standing for
hours, very exhausted, and very tired. And so another time, they thought, oh we had to jump on
one foot around the building, around there. But we were young, and I remember jumping and
laughing, you know? We were pushing each other on, and I jumped over to a SS, he was like ina
-- ina -- a SS coat, having a gun. He was like guarding us, yeah. And he was crying. When I saw
him crying, I don’t know how I dared, I asked him, what are you crying? So he told, I am not a
German. I am a Romanian. And they -- the Germans lied to me. They told me, would you wa --
would you like to go to the front? He was mobilized, yeah, he -- would you -- take into the army,
I mean. It’s -- how it’s c-called, not mobilized, draft, yeah, it was a draft. So he told, won’t you --
won’t you -- won’t -- would you like to go to the fr-front line, to the eastern front? No. So you
will be an SS. He didn't know what is SS. Okay, I’Il be an SS. He was not ver-very young in my
eyes, probably he was 35, so then I was 15, so it was old already for me, you know. So he told

me -- and I have a daughter like you at home. And I looked at you and I -- and I cannot bear it.
He cried. And then I -- in a short time I didn’t see him at all. I don’t know, maybe he left the SS
and went to the front, I don’t know. I never saw him again. That was one, you know, one person
who -- who couldn’t bear the -- who -- looking how we were punished and how we were beaten
or -- then a group of girls run away, and from the same place where the Russian Latvian guy was
working. So they shot every 10". They were counting when the -- when girls are standing on the
appelle, they were counting one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, out and th --
every 10 -- 10" people -- person was shot. So we knew we -- we are risking very much. And I
remember that one lady told, we have to watch each other not to let run away some other --
somebody. So I told her, are you crazy? Let run away everybody who can. We will be shot at,
not -- not earlier, so it’s later. But let everybody run. If I could, I would ru -- run, but -- but I --
that was I refused this time, and I didn’t have another time.
Q: So you -- you -- what did you think was going to happen to you?
A: You know, we heard already that the army, the Soviet army is coming. We -- we didn’t
believe that they will let us alive.
Q: The Germans.
A: The Germans. We thought they will kill everybody and that’s it. It will be the final solution.
We didn’t hear about the final solution there, but we he -- knew exactly what they want to do
with us, yeah. That’s it. Maybe I -- I remember that s -- the Soviet army started to bomb Riga.
And the Germans came running to the concentration camp, they’re hiding themself. Oh, we were
so happy to -- to look at them, how afraid they were of their lives, yeah. I remember opening the
window, telling them come, come to us. We are not -- we are not afraid to die of your bomb, but
together with the Germans. Here we all were making signs to them for -- through the window

and praying, come, come the bomb to -- to throughout yeah -- to throughout the concentration
camp [indecipherable] building. Didn’t happen. I don’t know where they bombed, but they didn’t
bomb the concentration camp. Yeah.
Q: So when -- can you describe when you leave the work camp? I want to keep going
chronologically --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- you worked for a year --
A: For a year, then --
Q: -- then what happened?
A: Then what happened. They shaved our heads, gave something else to wear, I think, other
uniform, and --
Q: Your heads weren’t shaved the first year?
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: Rachel cut me the hair in the first -- in -- in Kaiserwald, but then I had my hair until I was --
our concentration camp was evacuated already. So it means they were evacuated, we knew that
the Soviet army is coming. So they took us to the -- to a -- to the s-sea, and they -- we were going
aways -- be -- they took us to a -- a ship, and went to -- by the sea, we went to -- to Stutthof.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: This is another concentration camp, which was not a labor camp any more, it was only
concentration camp. And the death rate was very big, of course, very high. And crazy things,
crazy things there. Even in -- being in Strassenhof, they made a list of everybody who is younger
than 16 and older than 30. And they took all the people older than 30 years and younger than 16.

So because of Rachel, I was in -- not in the list, because she asked me to write myself older, not
to be a child. So I write myself not, so then I was probably 16, so I was two years older, so I was
18, so they didn’t take me. So then I went to Stutthof, it was -- it was horrible, it was -- we went -
- we were placed in a block, meaning a -- such a shtuba, a house, a wooden house where
criminals were in -- the bosses of the -- of -- of the houses, like a Russian criminal was a -- a
woman was -- she was the boss of our house, yeah.
Q: Mm-hm. H-How did you know she was a criminal?
A: You can see by her language. The curses, by the way of her behavior, I don’t know, or maybe
she was a prostitute maybe, not a criminal, and like that. And one time they told us to load big
stones on wagons to push them down -- down the hill, then to push them up the hill, to unload
them, then to load them again, push down the hill. It’s not so easy to push them hen -- down on
the hill there, have to go very slowly, so you have to hold. They were loaded by -- with this --
with brick stones, and to push it up the hill also, like that, the -- a whole day, yeah. All that to
make you happy. Then, of course, the beatings, and the st -- the illnesses, the starving was, you
know, it was over -- we were overwhelmed with dirt, with lice, with -- it was awful. Then one
day somebody told that they are taking some young people to work for the farmers. So we went
with Rachel. There was -- we stayed there probably two or three months. We worked very hard,
but at least we were more or less free. We could wash ourself, we washed our clothes, we were
more or less clean, you know, and the food was like, you know, the maid of the ba -- of the f-
farmer gave us a key of the basement where the potatoes were, and so we had it. But in three
months they took us back -- they took us back, so they took us to a shower. And you never knew,
if you are taken to a shower, it will be water from there, from the ceiling, or it will be death, who

-- they’ Il kill you. Because they used to do it from the same things, you know, the -- where the
showers are, they used to -- to send the gas to the area you are closed, yeah.
Q: How did you know that though?
A: I don’t know, but we knew.
Q: Just knew.
A: Yeah. We knew -- we saw the crematorium. The crematorium had smoke 24 hours a day, it
never stopped smoking, the smoke was black and smell it [indecipherable] the smell was
horrible. So we knew that they are burning people there. We knew it.
Q: Wh-Where was this?
A: In Stutthof.
Q: Stutthof.
A: Yeah, it was not in Strassenhof, it was in Stutthof, yeah. And every time, every appelle is
selecting people to the crematorium.
Q: Could you tell how they were selecting?
A: Oh, they were going like -- you are standing five people in a row, and you -- the SS men used
to go and look at you. And I don’t know, I -- I learned one thing, don’t show in your eyes that
you are afraid, because if you are afraid, oh, they look at you. Don’t show that you hate the --
hate them so much that you will kill them, otherwise, he will take you. Look at -- look -- don’t
look at them at all. Look through them, you know?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Like he would be a glass, and you look through them to -- to some point, I don’t know, and
look very indifferently. It’s not very [indecipherable]. Oh, you won’t -- you don’t take me, you’ ll

take me, maybe it’s even better than -- such a life is better death [indecipherable] no. We are
never selected, with Rachel.
Q: How did you manage to always stay -- it sounds like you were always physically with her,
that you didn’t get separated too much.
A: No, not too much at all. I don’t know how we managed. I don’t know how.
Q: What -- what was it like when you were separated for some reason?
A: I don’t know.
Q: You don’t remember being separated?
A: No. Not in the concentration camps, never. We were afraid of it.
Q: So if one of you was asked to do something, would the other one say, I’ll go with you?
A: No. Ju -- were not asked individual -- individually to do something. It’s a group.
[indecipherable] 10 people [indecipherable] we went together.
Q: What would you talk about at night together?
A: At night we used to talk how good it was at home. How tasty was the food what I hated and
didn’t eat. And I always thought, where is the kasha Mama gave me, and where is the milk I
didn’t want to drink? And that’s all, and some such things, and then where are our parents, our
sisters, and brothers? Are they in a concentration camp like we? Can they survive? And so on.
Yeah, and then we are -- we were [indecipherable] to a -- to a house after being in -- working for
the farmers, we are [indecipherable] a house, which was -- there were only sick people. Were no
beds, it was -- it were no beds before also, but it were be -- wooden beds, you know, in like --

A: Bunks, yeah?
Q: Wooden beds --
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: -- on top of each other, mm-hm.
A: So -- and here no bed -- no, no beds at all. Everybody was sitting on the floor, and because we
were so crowded, so many people were, so we were sitting in a row, like my legs were a little bit
spread in me, another person in me, like five. And we were sleeping like that, everybody was
leaning towards the other. And that was the worst. People were dying like -- like, you know,
flies. I remember I woke up, I was lying -- I was leaning -- leaning a li -- leaning up a -- a -- a
woman who was dead already. So, I mean, my head was on the dead corpse already, corpse. And
every morning used to come several men who were taking the corpses out of us, of our room,
yeah. And once I heard that the kapo who was coming and directing the people what to do, from
which line to take the corpses, spoke Polish. So I ask him, look, how is this Red army? Is she
coming? How far are they? Because we listen -- we heard already the bombs, the -- you know,
the -- the bullets falling, you know. So he told me, what are you doing here? A language is a
such powerful -- powerful thing, you know? It’s such a connection between people who are not
connected and maybe not even like each other. But he her -- he didn’t hear Polish very much,
and suddenly he heard Polish. So he ask me if [indecipherable] I mean miss. Oh, what I didn’t
hear wa -- for -- you know, for years. What are you doing here? I told him, you don’t know what
I’m doing here? [indecipherable] do you know that you will die here? Nobody will be alive here.
Go out of here. How -- how can we go out of here? So he told me, and he said, today will come a
German and take some people to work with the kitchen, with potatoes, to wash it, to prepare
food, I don’t know. Don’t be afraid, he underline me, it’s not to the crematorium. Go for -- and --

and stand up -- stand there in a line and wait until they will take you. And then it was -- one
German or two came, and we went with Rachel and they took us. Took us together again. Went
to another house where we are having to do these potatoes, you know. Bad, frozen potatoes,
preparing it for a dinner for the -- for the prisoners. And sleeping already in a room which had
the wooden beds, yeah. And then we heard that they are evacuate -- ready to evacuate the whole
concentration camp. Who can go, who can work? The others? They will -- they will take -- they
will make a fire and everything will be burned, and that what they did. And we were evacuated.
We went on that -- we went o-on the Death March, with this --
Q: Did -- did you choose to go?
A: Oh, I don’t remember if we choose --
Q: [indecipherable]
A: -- see, I -- I think they didn’t ask us. They didn’t ask us anything, they told us to go, so we
went. It was a horrible, of course, we were -- first of all, it was cold, it was the end of February,
the beginning of March, it was cold. It was snowing, it was freezing. We were -- we were in such
uniforms, as they gave us such, you know, things to cover us, is a -- like sheets, you know, some
to cover us. And the lice were all over us, I remember th -- th -- I [indecipherable] everything
was -- is -- is moving. They gave us a -- a piece of bread and go. And on the way we saw the
horses, together with German families, they were running from the Russians already, so they
load on the horses everybo -- everything -- on the carts actually, and th-they were running, and
sometimes Polish people were -- which were taken from Poland to work for the Germans were

A: Let -- s-stay alive, stay alive, the Russians are coming. Stay alive, stay alive, the Russians are
coming. It’s not far, it’s not far, but you -- you can hear. You can see the red sky from the fire of
the front, you know, and the Germans were running. And then they took us to a -- one small
camp. We were -- I don’t know, we were there for a week or so. And then they took us from the
small camp to -- again, was a march, yeah, and then they marched in -- we -- we came to a barn,
yeah. They opened the door and they told us to go. We didn’t know that people are there, and we
started to walk over the people. The screaming was so [indecipherable] we couldn’t -- we -- we
couldn’t understand what’s -- and the other rows are pushing us, yeah, and we cannot walk
because we are walking on the bodies of other people, heads, there were legs. But that was the
last place. They close the door and we didn’t hear from the Germans any more. The -- they -- we
were -- it was night, in the morning we wanted to go out, and we looked, you know, through the
door, and we looked for a -- for a s -- piece of light where -- where -- where we can see what’s
going on there. And we started to knock on the door. And some women were shouting, don’t
knock, they will shoot us. And we knocked. We knocked, we knocked, nobody was there, so we
started to push the door. And we pushed it open, no Germans. And we saw the road, and over
there, the army, the -- the Soviet army is standing. So a group of young girls, and including me
and Rachel, we run to the soldiers, yeah? We wanted to embrace them. They saw us, they started
to run away. Because we -- then they told us that we looked so horrible, that they were afraid.
What -- what are they, shadas of pe -- of some corpses, or some dead people, or -- who is
running? And we are -- were dirty, of course. And th-then they told us that we -- they were not
allowed to come over to us because we carried typhus and other illnesses. So it would be an
epidemic, you know, they were afraid of the army. They wanted to protect them. So they run,
and we run after them. And we came to a village, a German village. And I was sick, I was alr --

already absolutely sick. I felt that I -- I -- | was coughing, and I had the high fever. I felt it, I
didn’t have a -- a thermometer to -- to measure the fever. And we came over to a German village,
we open the one house we wanted to enter. So a family was sitting around the table and telling
us, raus. So we wacked out -- we walked out. We walked out and I saw a Russian officer going
through, and -- and I knew Russian, so I told him, look, you liberated us, but we don’t have
where to stay. What -- what do you mean where you don’t have where to stay? I told, they are
not alone. Oh yeah? He took this, his pistol, opened the door, opened the pistol and told, if you
don’t go away from this house, you will be killed. So they left and we occupied the house. I lied
down near a stove, which was [indecipherable] was hot. I was so cold, shivering. And Rachel
was very active. She took all my clothes off, and put in the stove, yet it was bong, bong, like the
lice and everything what -- and everybody did it, yes, some other girls came in. Then they took
water, they boiled the water and we washed ourself. Then we took some clothes there that was in
the house because we couldn’t stay naked, of course, and we couldn’t use the old uniforms
[indecipherable]. Then came -- we were already cleaner, a little bit, it came to feeding myself. I
remember Rachel brought a -- a piece of bread. Fresh bread, smelled a -- a -- she gave it to me.
So I gave one bite and I told, look at, I am full already, I cannot eat any more. And she told, you
know, I don’t know why, but I am full also. So we stopped eating, and other people started to eat

Poland, you will be stopped. And because you don’t have papers, no identification papers, no

dying, yeah. So, but I will die in Wilna where I was born. I don’t want to die in Germany of

were some machines inside, what probably the Soviets were taking from the Germans already,
like -- like to make x-rays. I saw the [indecipherable] like from some medicine machines or

looked around, asked them for papers, the officers gave them the papers. They ask, is there
anybody else here? No, nobody is here. Oh, okay. So the door was closed, and the train came to
Kovno to Kaunas, not to Wilna. Oh, so that we are free. Good, we are almost home. Kovno from

we -- oh, to look at us, you can see what we -- where we came from. And they asked us for
documents and we don’t have it. So give us a passport, give us something, we don’t have. So we
started to tell them that we were taken fro -- b-by the Germans. Uh-huh, come to KGB. And then
they started, we will arrest you, you’re spies, you’re -- everybody was spies, and you’re
prostitutes, you -- you run to the -- together with the -- with the ger -- German army. Look at us,
I thought [indecipherable] you will look at us, saw how we look, the hair shaved, and -- but what
was -- I don’t know what they would do this as, if not a Jewish guy who was in Kovno already
saw how the soldiers took us like that, you know, took us to the -- to the KGB. So they run there,
we didn’t know it, and they -- with money. So they gave her money for -- to the officer who took
us, yeah, to [indecipherable] us, yeah. And he let us go.
