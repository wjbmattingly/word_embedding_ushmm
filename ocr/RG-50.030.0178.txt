GIORGIO PERLASCA
August 5, 1990

A: I was just a few months old when we left Koma, and we transferred to .

Q: What did your father do and what was life like in ?

A: My father had a law degree just as his father had a law degree. At the time he was a
Municipal Secretary, which in...uh...Italian administrative life was a very important
position.

Q: When he was growing up...uh...when he was growing up, when he became a young man
in the 30s...uh.., tell us about...uh...his involvement in the Spanish Civil War. How did
that happen?

A: I went as a volunteer.

Q: How old were you?

A: I think twenty-five.

Q: And how long...how long were you there?

A: Two and a half years.

Q: When you come back from the Spanish Civil War, what did you do? What was your
work? Do you go back to school? What did you do?

A: I started working in a trade firm. This firm had its headquarters in Rome and I worked
however in many Italian cities in Milan, Belluno, Genoa, and eventually traveled
overseas. This firm dealt with...uh...with importing food stuff, especially...uh...livestock
and process meat.

Q: What happened to you and to your business as war approached?

A: Well, the war started almost immediately. I started working for this company at the end
of 1939, and the war started in September 39, so it started immediately. However, it
didn't start for Italy. Italy entered the war on June 10th, 1940.

Q: And when the war broke out, just tell us...take your time...tell us what happened to you
and what you did in the early years of the war.

A: Nothing happened. I continued to work. I didn't get involved in the war because I had an
official function with

the Italian State because this company imported livestock and process meat from Central
Europe.

Q: Did you come into contact with any Jews at that time or did you know anything about
what was happening to Jews in Europe?

A: Uh... Well, in Italy...uh...nothing was happening at the time. I had some Jewish friends
that I had gone to school with and I saw them until 1940. However, there were some laws
in Italy, and because of these laws, Italians...Italians of Jewish faith preferred to
immigrate to overseas, such as Central America and North America.

Q: When did it begin to change for you? Uh...When did you begin to need to move out of
Italy and the business?

A: Things started changing immediately in December of 1940. No. Actually, that was June
in 1940. I started traveling overseas places such as Croatia, Yugoslavia, Rumania,
Turkey.

Q: Just tell us then what happened in your words as it happened.

A: If you're referring to the situation of the Italian Jews, nothing was happening in Italy
except for those racial laws, which limited the professional in their trade activities, and
therefore, they preferred to immigrate. However, everyone was free and you could go to
restaurants and bars any time. However, we did have information and news that the
situation is Germany as far as the persecution of Jews was concerned was very bad
starting in 1939, and with the invasion of Poland the persecution escalated and it also
escalated in Czechoslovakia. These, of course, things that we all heard, but I saw it with
my own eyes in Poland and in Croatia, and Bulgaria. Of course, in Bulgaria, King
Boris...until King Boris was alive he tried to limit the persecution against Jews. And in
Rumania, of course, the persecution became extremely cruel in 1940...uh...and it was
worse in Rumania than in Germany where in Rumania, the Rumanians can be very
ferocious when they nurture political hate.

Q: At what point then did you...uh...go to Hungary? When and how did this happen? Tell us
your story.

Q: Excuse me. I think I want to pause and stop a minute please. We are going to stop for a
minute. Are we almost ready or are they still checking. Okay. 5 seconds to stand by.
Okay.

A: Getting back to the Jewish question, this was a very situation for them. When I was in
Croatia, Bulgaria, Rumania, and Poland I knew it was very serious then because of the
German occupation because extremist Nazi government been...uh...placed because the
Germans excentriated the fight against the Jews and so the situation was very critical. For
example in Belgrade, where I lived for a year even though L...I traveled while living there,
I saw that the beginning of 1942, the Jews completely were disappeared, were wiped out.

Uh...Immediately, however, the Jews were free to go to restaurants with their Christians
friends although there were some restrictions there too. And so when I was in Hungary, I
was surprised to see that the Hungarian Jews were free...uh...basically free. Uh...We had
business dealings with them and we could go to bars restaurants with them, and of
course, this is not true in other countries that I had mentioned...uh...where the persecution
against Jews was very ugly.

Q: What was it like for you in Hungary of 1942?

A: Fine. We could eat. We could drink. We could take walks. We had a lot of fun. We could
go to the movies a little bit. We danced a lot. Uh...We could bars, worked, and everything
worked for everyone. There were no restrictions.

Q: When did things begin to change?

A: Things suddenly changed on the evening between the 18th and the 19th of March 1944.

Q: Tell us.

A: Uh... That day Admiral Hortee who was a region of the Prime Region of Hungary...in
other words he was head of State, traveled to Germany to meet with Hitler. However, he
was arrested and detained for a few days. During those days, the Hungarian Democratic
government was struck down. At the time even though Hungary was in war, the
government was a democratic government. It had a parliament, a senate, a constitution.
Uh...So during Admiral Hortee's imprisonment...uh...they took advantage of this fact to
install a Nazi government. He...the Admiral then returned but the government had...was
already in place. And the first measures that were taken were anti-Jewish laws that were
passed and the first...including the imposing... imposition of wearing the star, the David
Star, on the front and on the back.

Q: What was life like for you? Did life change for you as well?

A: Uh... Yes, life did change for me because after the Italian Armistice on September 8th,
1943, I remained loyal to the Queen's government and so therefore I was among
those...uh...who were to be arrested, who were supposed to be arrested by the Germans.
Uh...But that morning I left my home and I never returned.

Q: Excuse me. We're going to have to stop. Excuse me. You tell him that an entire contract
hinges on that man's stopping. Now!

A: Ready now?

Q: Almost. Just keep on going. Okay.

A: Okay.

A: Uh...After the Armistice on September 8th, 1943, I had remained loyal to the Italian
government, and so I did not adhere to Mussolini's Social Republic. So therefore because
of this and because I had had some trade disagreements with Germans in Hungary,
I...uh...decided to hide when the Germans invaded Hungary...uh...on that morning, early
morning of March 19th.

Q: What did you do?

A: Uh... Yes. Yes. I needed to find a situation...a solution to..uh...my situation and I found
one when I asked the Spanish Legation for asylum. Uh...Because I had fought in the
Spanish Civil War, I could take advantage of the fact that the Spanish government had
said that anyone who had fought...any foreigner who fought in this war who should ever
find himself in difficulties could turn to the Spanish Diplomatic authorities for help.
And...uh...] ask therefore the Spanish government to give me a passport if...if I thought
that I needed and temporary citizenship. I didn't actually get it right away. I didn't go and
pick up my passport right away. Uh...in...in March 1944, and I hid for one week in the
Spanish extraterritorial buildings. Then the Hungarian government notified me that I was
to be interned and so I presented myself and I was interned from the beginning of April to
October 13th, 1944. During that time I could not follow the situation closely because I
wasn't in Budapest. We did hear...uh...about unpleasant...we did hear about unpleasant
news. Uh...We...we could read papers, but there was censorship.

Q: What happened next?

A: Uh... The internment wasn't bad at all. We had three meals a day. We had tea...uh...with
small cakes and cigarettes and soap and toothpaste, even some pocket money. And all of
this was according to the Geneva Convention. Uh...And there was treatment afforded to
Italian diplomatic members, and I fell within that category.

Q: Why was he then considered an Italian diplomat? At that point?

A: And because I was with the Italian Trade Commission.

Q: When did the internment stop? What happened to you?

A: It didn't stop. I escaped.

Q: Please tell us about it.

A: You want to know how he escaped?

Q: Yes.

A: Uh...On October 13th, 1943, I was very lucky. I had these fake papers which authorized
me to go to Budapest for health reasons. They weren't...it wasn't really true but anyway I
had the papers. Luckily, that morning a Swiss diplomatic car arrived with a Swiss
diplomatic and an Hungarian diplomatic who came to visit the internees where we were
and check on me. And that day I asked them to take me to Budapest. Of course, they
inquired about my documents and they realized they were fake, but they took me to
Budapest anyway and that was on the 13th. On the 15th, Admiral Hortee proclaimed
Armistice and....uh...but...uh...he specified in August of 44...it specified in August 44,
Admiral Hortee had fired. I must specific...I'm sorry, in August 1944, Admiral Hortee
had fired the Nazi government, had eliminated the Nazi government and set up in its
place a military government which is headed by General Lackatosh. Uh...This
government first abolished the Star of David, the wearing the Star of David, and struck
down the racial laws. So for about a month the Jewish community lived in relative peace.
For example on October 14th, I lunched with a Jewish Hungarian in a big restaurant in
Budapest. On the next day on the 15th, I lunched with Mrs. De Franco, who is also
Jewish Hungarian married to a Italian diplomatic in a public restaurant. And during this
lunch we heard that Admiral Hortee had proclaimed armistice to the Soviet Union and
Anglo-Americans.

Q: Question: He had said he left internment in 1943. Did he mean 1944?

A: 44.

Q: Thank you. Okay. After you...what happened to you after this luncheon in October of 44
with Senora DeFranco. Where did you go and what did you do?

A: Uh...This lady was very fearful when she heard this news which was being repeated on
the radio, broadcast over and over again. Anyhow, I...I didn't know what to do and so I
decided to seek refuge in my Hungarian friend's house for a few days. But after a few
days they asked me to leave because they said it was dangerous for them...uh...because
the Germans and the Hungarians...the Nazi Hungarians had bombarded the Royal Palace,
and Admiral Hortee was taken prisoner and...and taken to Germany. And immediately
following these events, the real anti-Jewish terror began. At least that's what I saw. And
the wearing of the star was imposed once again. But anyhow, I left my friend's house and
went to a private hospital but even there after a few days the Director asked me to leave
for...uh...same reasons. The next morning, therefore, I decided to ask...to go to the
Spanish Legation to ask for the passport that the Spanish government had promised me in
September 43 but which I didn't pick up because I didn't want to change nationality at the
time. Uh...So...uh...we went...1 went to the Legation and they had to write up a letter
saying they had searched for me a few years and that they finally found me and so that
we could proceed with the change of citizenship. So together with a...an attorney from the
Spanish Legation, we went to the Hungarian Ministry of Interior where my Italian
citizenship was abolished and I became a Spanish citizen. And I was asked to leave the
country within 15 days. Naturally, I couldn't leave. Where...where could I go?

Q: Please. Continue.

BREAK IN TAPE

A: Un...When I returned from the Ministry to the Legation, there was a lot of confusion.
There were a lot of people outside the Legation. Some of them were wearing the star.
Some were not. There were about a hundred people. I asked the attorney what was
happening and he responded that the Jews were seeking protection, but the Legation had
a problem because the only one Christian who could handle all the workload because
the...the attorney told me he was also Jewish, and that he was a war hero. He had been a
war hero during World War I. And so anyway they had this problem because they
had...didn't have enough people and they even had at one point 300 people who had been
protected and who were taken away and they did not know anything about their
whereabouts. So at that point I went to the and I told that what I had just learned myself
and offered my help. He replied that...uh...he would be willing and happy to work...to
have me work with him, but he couldn't pay me. And I said that I didn't need any money,
that I had enough to live on in those days. So we had one more letter written up to the
Ministry...to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Hungary which we took over
with...uh...Sanspritz which...uh... was an official statement that I was a member of the
Spanish Legation and we had it...a stamp put on it, and I also got my diplomatic identify
card...uh... Since Sanspritz therefore was dealing exclusively with the Foreign Affairs
Ministry. That was his responsibility. Myk responsibility was to deal with the Jewish
protection organization. I had the authorization, official authorization to do that.
However, I didn't know how to start. Uh...And so I asked around and I asked Attorney
Farkosh who unfortunately died the first day that the Russians arrived and that this
tragedy and a new tragedy started.

Q: We are going to pause and change tapes.

TAPE #2

A: At the beginning...uh...my work consisted in trying to find the 300 people who
were...who had been protected by the Spaniards and who were arrested...who had been
arrested by the Nazis...uh...at the very...the very first few days of the new government. So
a couple of times I went, I traveled to the Hungarian German border and eventually we
found a few of these people who had better protection from the Spanish Legation. And
we took them back to Budapest. Uh...Then we went to this train station where goods and
merchandise are unloaded on the docks...on the platforms. I'm sorry. And...uh...these are
the platforms where the Germans took away thousands of Jews to Germany. And there
we found there more people. And out of the 300, we found about 150. We don't know
what happened to rest. At the time...uh...that reminds me, I had a small...a little episode
happened to me. I saw that there was a column of people who were being deported
and...uh...among these people, there were two twins who were very attractive kids and
very friendly looking kids who were about 11 years old. And...uh...so I thought to myself,
what would happen to them and...uh...decided to tell them, "Look, kids. You see that car
over there with the Spanish flag. Run to the car and the chauffeur will close the doors and
you'll be safe." But at that moment a major of the Gestapo ran to the car because he
wanted those kids back. I told them that the kids were in an extraterritorial car protected
by the Spanish Legation. So he took out a gun and threatened me. But next to me was Mr.
Wallenberg, who told the German that I was a representative of the Spanish Government
and that the kids were in an extraterritorial car. And...uh...so the German responded,
"Leave me alone. You're...you're impeding...you're disturbing my work." And so I
responded, "You call this work?" So, of course, he got madder and madder and everyone
was speaking very loudly at the same time and that includes Wallenberg; that includes a
Vatican representative; the Swiss and the Portuguese representatives; all the neutrals.
And at that point a Colonel approached and asked what was happening and he was told
and he finally said, "Well, let it be. Their time will come too", meaning that the two kids
would be taken away. So the kids...uh...stayed in the car and the two Germans left. And I
asked Wallenberg who that man was, and he responded, "That was Eichmann."
The...uh...two kids didn't have a letter, obviously, of protection....uh...so when we got
back to the Legation...oh..and...and when we got to the Legation, I realized they were not
two boys as I had thought, but it was a boy and a girl who looked identical but they were
of a different sex and so I had to find a house for them but I don't remember the details.
At the time if I remember, we only had one house.

Q: Keep going please. Please continue.

A: So the...uh...the org...the organization to protect...the Spanish organization to
protect...uh...Jews started and this was an initiative...was not an initiative of the Legation.
Uh... The Spanish government was trying...was not an initiative of the Legation. It was the
Spanish Government was trying to save as many Jews as possible and I saw that this was
happening in Croatia. Uh...and according to Spanish...uh...norms and regulations, they
were trying to save as many Jews as possible. Uh...We had one house at the beginning
and we slowly built up to six houses. But the protection consisted of much more than just
writing the letters and of putting up a flag and a banner. That was not enough.

The...uh...much more attention had to be given to the aftermath and...and to the fact that
the Nazis could take them away. And so we had to provide protect...that kind of
protection too, not only to our Legation but to the others too, to Switzerland,
Sweden...uh...to the Vatican and to the Portuguese. At the end of November, we had
about 3,000 people who were being protected. Now on the...other...the last day of
November or the first of December, Sanspritz left Hungary. Now, in a document that I
have written previously...memorial that I have written previously, I wrote down the date
as being December 7. I did that to cover Sanspritz. I did that because I wanted to protect
him and he needed 10 days, about 10 days more than necessary so that I could protect
him. But now I have chosen to tell the truth. However, I can't give you any more details
now, because I first have to speak with the Spanish Ambassador. I will speak with him
tomorrow evening because something happened which disturbed me very much.
Something very sad happened. And it was sad because it revealed to me that this human
soul has...uh...evil elements in it. But first before getting into this, I must speak to the
Spanish Ambassador for reasons of loyalty. Anyway, that day...uh...either the last day of
November or the first day of December and I don't remember exactly which one,
Sanspritz, who is a diplomat, a career diplomat left. And so I was trying to decide what to
do. I'd heard by the way that he'd left at about 6:00 AM...uh...through a phone call and I
don't remember if it was him...if he personally who called me or someone else, a legal
attaché or what. But anyway, I learned that he was...that he'd left. And so I took a walk
around the international ghetto wondering what I could do and I found myself in Lagradi
Corroli Street, and I saw that this building was being occupied by the police, so I entered
the building and asked what was happening and saw that there were people with
suitcases, a few suitcases and...uh...the people, the Jews in the house told me that the
police want...wanted to take them away. So I decided to lock the door and...uh...L...I went
to see the lieutenant and I asked him what was happening and I told him that he couldn't
do this because the house is being protected...uh...by the Spaniards and he needed my
permission, and I was surprised at his behavior since he was part of the regular police
forces. He was not a parliamentary police force. So we came to an agreement. The police
agreed to postpone everything for a few days and we went to a park where we met with
these members who belonged to a committee which have representatives from police
force, Ministry of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and I protested what was happening and
someone told me that the...that they had heard that the Spanish representative had fled the
city and so there was no more relations with the Spanish Government. I told him that he
was wrong and that the Spanish had not fled but that he'd went to Germany to talk with
his colleagues from Germany, France and Switzerland and at the meantime I was his
legal substitute and I had documents to prove it. Uh... demanded that the
Hungarians...uh...uh...respect the agreement that...that existed between Spain and
Hungary. So the foreign affairs representative agreed to postpone everything by 2 or 3
days which gave..uh...new time to go to the Foreign Affairs Ministry to solve the
situation.

Q: Please continue.

A: During this conversation in the park, I saw a column of Jews who'd been deported from
the international ghetto which was right there and...uh...I saw that these were people who

were once in the houses protected by the Spaniards and I think this was in the...Palina
Street, but I'm not sure. Uh...So I made them give me these people back. There were
about 300 of them. By the way in the hotel where I'm staying, Mr. Voni came to see me
and he was staying in a house in the...the Gradi No. 25. He was 12 at the time and his
memory is better than mine and he reminded me of some details of that incident. For
example, he told me that there was a little 11 year old girl who came to see me when I
went to that house and asked me, "Please Mr. Save my mother." So I said, "Yes. Yes. Be
good and stay put." And she came back to me three times with the same request and the
last time she came to me and she said, "Look, if you save my mother I'll go to bed with
you." So I slapped her. And...uh...then her mother came to me and asked me why I'd
slapped her and, of course, I explained to her and perhaps I didn't do the right thing to
slap her but anyway that...that's what happened. Uh...Then there was another lady
who...whose name I don't remember right now and who was in park who is living in the
same street and same house as Eva Lang, that Eva Lang was living on the 4th floor, and
this other lady...lady was living on the 5th floor with her husband. But, of course, I
couldn't know everyone at the time. I didn't even know Eva Lang....uh...who now is
famous. She is a famous artist and journalist. But anyway, I went back to the Legation
and I found there a representative of...representative of the Swedish Legation, Mr.
Danielson and he...uh...had told me that Mr. Sanspritz had given him the responsibility to
protect the Spanish...uh..Legation. I was very much afraid and became very fearful
because the relations...diplomatic relations between Sweden and...uh...Hungary were not
good. So...he also told me that...uh...he was...uh...he took 17,000 Swiss Francs from the
Spanish Legation, and that he would send his assistant to check on the
situation...uh...regularly. And I became quite fearful, so I called the Swedish Legation,
and I said, "Please don't send anyone. We don't need your protection because that will
make matters worse." And he was happy to hear this because...uh..., of course, Swedish
relations with Hungary were not good. And as matter of fact some serious events had
occurred. The...uh...the Swedish...I'm sorry...the Spanish...uh...diplomatic legation had an
influence on Hungary and we didn't understand it at the time why we had this favorable
treatment. We under...only understood it later. Uh...But anyhow, the...uh...there was no
more question of being protected by the Swedes.

Q: Alright. Continue.

Q: Okay. Can you give me the jest of it and then we'll go on and do the translation later?

A: Okay. Okay. Uh...The same day I started in my regular activities which
included...included the continuous granting of letters of protection, which included
finding houses because six were now eventually built up to eight. And...uh...this work
intensified and I established relations with the various police forces, with the Hungarian
Nazi Party, and I was looking for support, and it didn't matter where it came from. The
important thing was that I got support...uh...because letters were not enough. These
houses needed to be...needed to be protected 24 hours a day. Uh...If you talk to , she will
tell you many more details. She was a young girl at the time and she lived through this
tragedy with her family. But anyway, I was seeking contacts. It didn't matter where they
came from. The important thing was that...that they were useful contacts. So I went to the

Foreign Affairs Ministry to clarify the situation. I said...clarify...uh...and I said...I told
them what I...what I had to say. When I...when I use the clarify...when I knew this I said
what I had to say. And...uh...the permanent, the foreign affairs permanent secretary
just...uh...believed what I said and...uh...and I began to...I began to understand why
Hungary had so much respect for the Spanish Legation. I only began to understand. It
wasn't perfectly clear. And this was because...uh...in Madrid, the
Hungarian...uh...Legation in Madrid had remained faithful, loyal to Hortee after October
15th. And, of course, all Hungarians still looked to Hortee. And the Nazi government
didn't have a representative in the Spanish government and they wanted one, and I
understood that they wanted one. Uh...Anyway, we came to an agreement and...uh...1
get...I got the sensation that I was being...uh...that I was in a stronger position...uh...and I
even saw the Foreign Affairs Minister for a few minutes...uh...Mr. Kennenee. And having
understood this, we worked better. And it was lucky because...uh...I don't know if
Sanspitz either forgot or left on purpose a...his signature pad. Uh...And which I used. The
agreement were that no letters could be dated after November 8th, so I just dated all the
letters before November 8th, and I used his signature although I signed about 50 myself
after December and I also signed two or three passports which...which, of course, were
false and had no legal bearing. Uh...Anyway, the weeks passed by and...uh...I understood
that they wanted to send a representative to Madrid to...uh...forge peace treaty, to sign a
treaty...uh...and they realized their mistake and...uh...uh...eliminating Hortee, so...uh...the
other legations were...didn't count. The Swedish Legation had been destroyed. The
embassy didn't count and...uh...had Swedish protection, but it didn't count and the
Portuguese counted very little. There was a Vatican, but...uh...Fununchio was tired. He
was old and he was sick and although he was in good faith, the Swiss were like fish in the
water. You never knew what they were going to do. And...anyway, no one counted really,
because they were all against Nazis. Uh... There was the International Red Cross that was
headed by Mr. Weirman, who...uh...who I will talk about later...uh...diplomatic
representatives need courage in tragic moment. I don't know if I had courage and I really
wasn't think about it at the time. I wasn't thinking about the dangers. But I will say this.
That the representative of the International Red Cross who had ambassadorial
rank...uh...was a..uh...wicked man. Uh...I've...even if I've written differently at other
times, now I can say that he is a wicked man.

Q: Ask him please why the representative from the Red Cross was a wicked man. Please
explain.

A: I say that because he didn't have any courage. Uh...Perhaps I didn't have any courage
either, but he locked himself in the basement of a hotel...uh...and didn't come out. I...to
proceed with this story, I met with a...a German General who was the military
representative in the city to protest...uh...the fact that...uh...Jews were being taken from
the international ghetto to the common ghetto. So I went to...uh...see him. I would go to
anyone who I thought could help me. And...uh...I said that I was disturbed by these
movements because the enemy might think that actually they were troops that were being
moved so...uh...I was fearful of that so I asked him if the Red Cross, International Red
Cross, the Swedes...the Swiss had any...uh...contacts with the Soviet Union for...or could
have any contacts with the Soviet Union for an honorable surrender of the capitol. And

the German replied that he had his orders, and he couldn't do anything about it. So I went
to see Weirman, and I told him what the German General had said and that if he sought
contacts with the Soviet Union, then an honorable surrender might be possible in order to
avoid further fighting and deaths. And he told me that he just would not do it, and he
could not do it. Uh...And I knew that he was living in this basement all the time...and
reinforced basement, was reinforced so that he could be protected from bombs. And that's
why I say that he was wicked. He didn't do anything. Uh...By the way, that reminds me
that I have...1 bought condensed milk for the kids on the black market with the Red Cross
symbol.

Q: Okay. Let's pause. We need to pause and change tapes. Let's do this very fast.

Tape #3

A: I just want to clarify what I meant about Weirman. Uh...I said that he was wicked and but
not everyone was like me who could...uh...they haphazardly and casually just get
involved in...in the situations like I did. What I'm trying to say is that I think he was
wicked because I would have done differently. Probably in his situation and his physical
mental state of mind he had his reasons for doing that, but I would have done differently.

Q: Why...why do you think you did what you did?

Q: Thank you. Are we done? Did you finish.

him to finish as he wants to finish. Go ahead and we will do it.

September 7, 1990
Tape #4

Q: Would you tell me your name please?

A: My name is George Perlasca.

Q: And you were born where?

A: I was born in Komo (ph) on January 31st, 1910.

Q: wee

A: You're welcome.

Q: 8

A: It's too much for my personality.

Q: Can you tell us what happened to you when you were released from released from
internment and you came back to Budapest in 1944?

A: I escaped on October 13th, 1944. It wasn't an internment camp. I had my own room.
Each person had his own room. We ate three times a day and then we had tea in the
afternoon and they even gave us cigarettes, soap and toothpaste and even money. And
this was according to the Geneva Convention because I was aggregated to the Italian
commercial delegation and therefore I had uh I was uh I could uh have diplomatic uh
treatment. Uh the 13th I left. The 13th of October and I arrived in Budapest that evening
and the next day I don't know what I did but on the 15th the armistice was proclaimed
between Hungary, Russia, Great Britain and America. This was an announcement, a
terrible announcement because no one was prepared for it except a few people who who
knew questions of state and government. I was surprised. I was having lunch with an
Italian lady who was of the Jewish faith and she was married to an Italian diplomat and
we...she was speechless and I was surprised, and I didn't know what to do. So II hid
because the TV was controlled by the Admiral government and everything else
fell in the hands of the Nazis and of the Germans, Hungarian Nazis and the German army
and their...and then I went to hide in a house which belonged to a friend of mine, uh
family friends in the and from this house I went to a hospital to hide because I
didn't know where to go because from the first evening I slept in a friend's house in

who gave me the keys to his apartment. The next day I discovered that the maid
was a German, a , and she was pro-Nazi and therefore I didn't go back to that house
because it seemed dangerous to me. After a couple of days in the hospital, I spent two
more days in hiding. I was hidden by the land...by the landlady in the house where I used
to live once upon a time, but then I realized that the Ugandian (ph) Hotel that I knew very
well was being emptied because many German officers were leaving with their suitcases

and I went to the keeper of the building and I asked him if he could give me a room and
he said give me a passport and I said I don't have any passport anymore. I don't have any
more documents and he said OK, for two days I'll give you a room and then I...so I didn't
know what to do. And so therefore the next morning I decided to go to the Spanish
Legation. It was probably eight in the morning. I went there and on the way, on the road,
and Iwas on foot,on___ Street which is a big street, I saw that some Hungarian Nazis
were chasing a child who was probably seven or eight years old. They reached him and
one of them shot the child in the back of the head. I was quite struck by this naturally and
I asked a passerby why, what did that child do? Who is he? And he said he's Jewish.
From the roofs of the houses, however, there were some Jews who were shooting against
the Nazis from the rooftop houses. But anyway I went to the Legation andI found —__
who gave me a passport and I...he said come tomorrow with two photos, and I had two in
my pocket which I pulled out, and I gave them to him and then he gave me the passport.
And he also gave me a letter from the Minister of Interior which said that the Spanish
government two years earlier had granted me their citizenship because I had fought in the
civil war and also, the letter also said...and that I had asked for a citizenship and the letter
said that they were not able to locate me and that they now found me and I had to assume
citizenship, Spanish citizenship.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE
So we were...with this letter 1 went together with the legal attaché...we went to the
Minister of Interior where I changed citizenship. I canceled the Italian one and I assumed
Spanish citizenship. When I returned to the Legation that early morning, it was probably
eight or nine a.m., and it's strange that that morning Sanspritz (ph) got up at eight a.m.,
but these were very difficult times and people didn't always go to sleep. I saw...thank
you...that there was a lot of confusion around, surrounding the Legation at the entrance
and in the courtyard, and that many of these people who were there had were wearing the
David Star, Star of David, and I asked the legal attaché what was happening and he said
that these were people who are asking for our protection, protection from the Spanish
government but right now we're in difficulty because the only Christian legation is
Sanspritz. And therefore it's impossible to organize an external protection and it's it
doesn't make any sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be of help, then
I...maybe I can do something, so we went to Sanspritz and I told him I'm available if you
need me, and he said yes. Sanspritz said yes but I can't pay you because we don't have
any funds to pay you with and I said I'm not interested because I have enough money to
survive on my own. And so I started immediately. I started working immediately. The
first few hours I must tell the truth....I didn't know what to do and I didn't know where to
start, but then after speaking with uh the attorney Fakash (ph) who was the attorney and
also with the Chancellor and with other people who were there who were all Jews,
Fakash, the Chancellor, her son and all of the refugees and so I realized what could be
done. The first thing was to try to get back about three hundred people who had been
protected by Spain. They had about three hundred, only three hundred at that time
because the Hungarian government had said three hundred, and Sanspritz accepted this
decision on behalf of the Spanish government and this is something that I didn't, didn't
accept immediately at first so those first two or three days my job was to try to find those

who had been protected, of the three hundred protected. Of the three hundred I was able
to get a hundred and fifty back and I found them at the uh Merchandise Depot, at the train
station and also by going to the border between Hungary and say Austria and Germany,
and those who had a Spanish ID we were able to bring them back. It seems to me we had
rented two trucks but I don't remember now how many, or we brought them back with the
train or we reserved a special car...I, I don't really remember how that happened. I was
with the car. I had a car. So I started working. I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if
you're going to edit it, edit this tape... ..So the episode at the train station...you can
take it from the other tape and put it together, piece it together. (Pause- Technical
Conversation) The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my eyes to
what was happening and to how things were actually really were, at the train station they
were loading train cars with Jews who were being deported because the Hungarian
government said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to
give thirty million uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that
wasn't true, that they were going to work. They were people who were being deported
and then we didn't know what would happen to them in the end, so much so that Eva
Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a laborer. He went on the train but on the trip
between Budapest and the border he understood...I don't know how...but he understood
that it was a trick and so he jumped from the train and he came back to Budapest. And he
came back to Budapest to . I don't think that that building existed yet but anyway
he came to one of the Spanish houses, so...this episode of the two twins...at a certain
point there was a column which was going and we were looking to see if anybody was
there with Spanish letters, and I saw two twins, two kids of eleven or twelve years old.
They were very handsome kids, nice kids and they were identical and the more I saw the
more | told myself how is it possible that I, I let them go, and so I told these kids, you see
that car over there. Get in the car. Run to the car. Get into the car. Close the door and
then the chauffeur will know what he has to do. Maybe you would like to hear from me
how I could communicate with these people. At the time I spoke German, French,
Spanish, but I could explain myself, I could express myself in Hungarian for a little bit
and perhaps I spoke Hungarian with these children, but anyhow these kids went. One
Gestapo major came to and he wanted the kids back, and I said no. They were in the car.
It's a Spanish car and it had a Spanish uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license
plates and therefore the car was extra-territorial property. He insisted. He took out his gun
and then so forth, and next, Wallenberg was next to me and Wallenberg said...told the
major, the German major, look...this man represents Spain. You can't...you can't commit
any violent acts. He said look. He's getting in the way of my work, and instinctively I
replied that you call this work. That's what I asked him. And so he got even more angry.
He wanted the kids back. And L...at that point I saw the situation getting really bad. I
thought my God, this man is crazy. He could shoot us. He had a big gun, a Mauthauser
(ph), a big big gun, but at that point...we were all yelling. I was screaming. Wallenberg,
the Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss, the Vatican...everyone intervened in the
discussion. There were many loud voices at the same time and so this colonel, a colonel
came, an SS colonel came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what was happening and
he asked the major what was happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said
now let it be...their time will come too for the kids. And so they left. And then I brought
these kids home. I brought them to the Legation and I was surprised to see that they were

really a boy and a girl who when they were fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it
was a boy and a girl and they were perfectly identical. The same height, the same
face...everything, everything was identical. This is an episode that struck me which,
which along with the other episode of the child who was killed on the street, these two
episodes made me reflect very much. It's not that...at the time I really wasn't fully aware
of the situation. From the end of March to October 13th, I was not...I had been interned
away from Budapest in the countryside...I continued my work. I stopped looking for the
three hundred people because I got one hundred and fifty back and it seemed have
understood that there was nothing more that could be done and so I started to organize the
protection network. We had a house. I don't remember where it was. (Technical
conversation) I don't remember which one it was but we did have one house. Maybe two
houses we had already. Maybe they were ___ wherever Long was...yes, it's perhaps...but
anyway that's not important. I started organizing by issuing hundreds of letters
immediately. Letters of protection and I would...I would let these people come in. We
would go to the office and type up these letters. Sanspritz didn't know anything because
we used his signature pad. He didn't know how many. His job was to keep relations with
the Foreign Affairs Minister. So we issued I think more than two thousand five hundred
protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end of October and November. To
be more specific...1 couldn't be more specific than that. I think we maybe reached three
thousand, more or less. It wasn't very easy. Not only...it wasn't sufficient to issue a letter
of protection and to escort these people to their house because they had to be escorted to
a building after all. I had some people who were willing to accompany these people with
their cars uh as the letters of protection were issued. There were cars who were available
and who shuttled back and forth between the Legation and the houses where they were
going to live and they would go back and forth continuously and therefore and so we had
to uh provide for everything. We had to get them settled. Normally these apartments that
we would take, we had to pay the rent, but these are details that are of no importance and
perhaps we didn't even pay the rent. We also had to feed these people and we had to be
careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to take them because they did do that. They did
especially they would try to attack those Swedish houses and Swiss houses because they
had a a system of protection which was not correct. In other words, they had given, both
of those countries had a mixed committee, Jewish and Christian committee which was
responsible for issuing letters of protection. To sum it up these letters were being sold.
The authorities and particularly the Nazis found out about this and so therefore every day
they, they would come and take uh raid the Swiss and the Swedish houses. I think that as
far as I know Sweden issued forty million letters of protection and in its houses it had
maybe three or four thousand people because they would come in the afternoon and the
next day there would be raids, and this is not something that I just heard. They weren't
rumors. I saw them with my very own eyes and with Wallenberg I asked him why did
you, why do you do that kind of stuff. That's not correct. These letters are being sold and
everyone knows about it. The authorities know about it. Anyway, we had to protect to
prevent that these people be taken. We had to protect them. With one excuse or the other
the Nazi police...not the regular police...the regular police would intervene when they had
orders but there was also various police forces, Nazi police forces in various
neighborhoods of representing various factions which were ferocious. They killed. They
uh they robbed and that was their goal, and we had to protect the those who were being

protected from themselves because these, these people sometimes lacked common sense.
Sometimes it was useless. It wasn't enough to tell them don't go out of the houses because
if you go out of the house they'll take, they take you away. They put you in the prisons
and the Nazis may even kill you, and to...that will give us more work to do because we'll
have to come and get you and find you and this happened many times. They would go
and take a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find their boyfriend...all these things. Or
for whatever reasons, their own reasons. I even created the committees in each house
with three members and their job was to be concerned about hygiene, discipline, order,
and to prevent people from leaving the houses and going on the streets. They had to
remain inside the houses because there they were safe. If they left the houses, they were
no longer safe. They would take their stars off and they would go outside and there would
be Nazis there who would ask them for their papers and what papers could they show.
They didn't have any. If they did, it would be clear that they were Jews and
therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then. And so we had to find uh food
for them and security besides watching. We were pretty lucky. It was a continuous job
because we had to travel throughout the neighborhoods continuously to show the flag, to
show that we were present and continuously...I went at least twice a day and daringly, I
went daringly on the streets and little by little with the with the car...I would go with the
car and so the people could see the, the uh flag, so the people could see that the car was
guarding them, and therefore and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new houses
were organized. We tried with a hospital too but it was but it failed. The...it was my idea
but it was a bad idea. It didn't go well. So weeks went on. Months went by...sorry...weeks
went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work
with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't, I didn't think that you didn't need to have
contacts with the authorities. Quite the contrary. I made as many contacts as possible.
I...one day for example I took ...I don't know what that is...I took twenty-five
thousand _ to the secretary of the minister who was very... ..oh, money. OK.
This is money that he brought to the Hungarian uh refugees in Transylvania and Russia
and Carpetia and the refugees...and this is money for the children and he was very
thankful and every time, every time I was in the neighborhood where he...I went up to see
him to say hello to him and this gave me the possibility to ask him information all the
time, how it was going at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, for example. For example, since
Fritz didn't want to go to the Ministry, since Fritz (ph) never left the Legation to visit a
house...he never visited any of the houses. He didn't know anything. He wasn't interested
even in how many signatures were used with his signature pad because he was a diplomat
and he had uh limited vision. He was an old-timer diplomat. This is a very...what he did
was very serious and uh correct but it would have been a good thing in times of peace and
in normal times when the war was not ideological as it had become, when there was no
persecution of the Jews. Not only of Jews but also the uh in Hungary there were many
uh...uh they had orchestras. They played the violins and they had restaurants and they
played the orchestras and with the violins and their famous people...in Hungary and in
Serbia (ph)... . I'm sorry...] can't find the word...you know...these traveling homeless
kind of people...oh...uh... they, they dress in flashy costumes...(gypsies)...gypsies,
gypsies....thank you. Gypsies. Gypsies. Gypsies. I couldn't find the
word...sorry...OK. (Pause) In Belgrade on...day and night I went to restaurants and I had
meals and in the evenings they had orchestras. They were played by the gypsies. And

there was a beautiful restaurant in in Square, where there was a good
orchestra and there were a couple of good violinists. One day they disappeared, in
January of '42 I think it was. Yes. January of 1942 they disappeared. I asked the owner of
the restaurant, what happened to the orchestra, the band. And he said well...at first he
didn't really want to answer. He was reticent, and then he said the Germans took them
off, because they are of an inferior race. So they persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that
area were many of them, and the Poles. Not only uh Jewish Poles but the citizens too, and
this is something that I saw. This is not something that I just heard. I saw it. So, so
we...this is how we worked, issuing these letters of protection and then Sanspritz left. I
don't remember if he left the 30th of November or December Ist. Uh it seems...I think
that the ambassador, Spanish ambassador told me November 30th. He told me November
30th, but I don't know if he's sure about this or not. Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and that
morning there was a reaction on behalf of the Nazis. I found myself that morning, early in
the morning I was called...six in the morning...and I don't remember who called me but
they called me from the Legation to tell me that Sanspritz had left and so I got up and II
visited the international ghetto thinking what do I do now? What is the situation? And in
a certain sense the Nazis helped because by...when I went in front of the house of
Street, Number 25, where the child was in this house...he reminded
me of some details the other day when I saw him for the first time. He recalled some
details that I didn't remember. I saw besides...speaking of he exaggerates when I
say that I uh yelled to the Nazis and said get out of here. He exaggerates. As a child, he
thought that that's what I did but it wasn't quite like that, but anyhow that's how he saw it.
That's his mentality. More or less that's how it was, but I wasn't screaming. I wasn't
yelling. So I saw...I entered this house and I said, what is happening here. They
were...they told us oh they want to take us away. The police want to deport us. And sure
enough the regular police was there. Not the Nazis, the regular police was there which
was commanded by a lieutenant, and I asked this lieutenant, what do you want. I've got to
take everyone away. And I closed the door in front of him. I locked it, and I said look, no
one is leaving. The Spanish flag is here. The Spanish emblem is here. This...we consider
this house extra-territorial property. It wasn't legal. It wasn't right, but what governs such
governments, you could just say...you could make up things like that. It couldn't have
been an extra-territorial house. You needed special permission from the government. The
government had not given any special permission to do that, and so we discussed and we
reached an agreement that he would postpone the...and together we would go to the park,
in the center of the park, where there was a committee composed of various police forces,
the Nazi party, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Interior Minister and I don't know who
else...seven or eight people. And I went there to speak with these people and I spoke with
energy and with boldness because if I went there with my hat in hand and I said hey, they
would say hey, this guy doesn't know what he's doing. You had to assert yourself,
especially with the Hungarians because these people are, are tough people and you had to
be just as tough, and he said...I asked him what's happening, why do you want to take
these uh people away. He said because Sanspritz fled. Who said that he fled? Sanspritz
took a trip. He went to Bern where he is going to meet Spanish, Italian, French, German
and Swiss diplomats to discuss the situation, but then he is coming back. But in the
meantime I am his...the legal representative of the Spanish government and charge
d'affaires and I showed him my passport and my diplomatic pass and so the Foreign

Affairs Minister representative said yes, this man is uh right what he said, so that's the
way it was. The only thing is that uh Sanspritz really did leave. He did flee, and he didn't
have any intentions of coming back. So much so that he didn't even tell me that he was
leaving. He didn't tell me anything. Nothing at all. He left. And I learned about it when he
was already at the border. He left at four or five in the morning. Anyway, but that's not
important. Perhaps it was a good thing. It was a good thing, because the Nazis uh had
invaded that house and it gave me the opportunity to present myself as the successor to
the man who they thought had escaped, so the representative of the Foreign Affairs
Ministry said OK. You're right. The situation is legal. Uh and I said look, there's a flag at
the Legation. There's a flag at all the houses too, and he said...we had an agreement that
after two or three days I would go to the Foreign Affairs Minister Ministry to clarify the
Spanish position and in fact this is what happened, but when I went back to the Legation,
I found that the Swedish Danielson (ph) Minister who was Wallenberg's boss had been to
the Legation. Danielson wanted to get some money...some Swiss francs. They're about
seventeen thousand Swiss francs which were in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I
protested at...this is ____ who is the Chancellor, and I said what do we do now. We still
had some _, some money left and not very much. She didn't know what to do and she
said that he said that he would send a secretary every morning, a Swedish secretary to see
that everything was uh alright, and I said no, please, don't do that. I called Minister
Danielson. I begged him not to send anyone and that and that I would go and see him
later on to explain the situation and I'm I went probably the next day or so, because if
Sweden uh protected the interest of the Spanish Legation, that meant that the interest of
the Spanish Legation would no longer exist. So we continued to work. . The
situation in the houses came back to normal and while I was there in the park I saw that
there was a column of Jews that were being deported and I saw that someone was waving
and so I went to see and I saw that these were some of the people protected from another
houses of the same street, the Street, of Number 33 which was very close, and so I
made them give me back. The situation in the houses was probably, was pretty normal
and peaceful. I don't know what those questions refer to. (He hasn't understood the
question.) There were...you mean...are you referring to the quantity of people who were
there, the sleeping conditions, the eating conditions...what are you referring to?

. In during December, the first ten days of December, we took some other
houses...the last two houses, it seems to me. But the...from a point of view of the living
conditions it was a very difficult situation and the house, there were five hundred
people. _ told me that they slept on the steps. I don't remember exactly even though
there was a committee that held the list of all the people who arrived every day, but I
don't remember how many there were exactly, because...I must step forward here. The
morning that the Russians arrived, I burnt everything, even the lists of those who were
protected because you never know. If they fall in the hands of the Russians or the
GPU...you don't know how they could have interpreted this fact, so we destroyed
everything. The Chancellor didn't want to. She wanted to save a few things, and I said no.
Everything will be destroyed because nothing shall be left in the hands of the Russians
because the Russians, the same day entered the Legation as I expected, had predicted.
And then they uh then they burnt it...they damaged it but I left. The situation was
difficult. As far as living conditions it was also difficult for the food. It was difficult for
the hygienic conditions. It was difficult to find medicines. There was a difficult time, for

example, because they had tried to close the water supply in some of the houses. The
Nazis had tried to do this and so I protested with vigor. I went to the police commander
and I demanded that the water be returned. These things cannot be done because if there
is a protection, then these people must have the necessary elements to survive. If there is
no water, I don't know what would have happened. With five hundred people and and if it
were sixty or seventy...I don't know how, what would have happened. And then there was
the problem of food. We had to feed these people. At a certain point there was no more
money left from the Legation...this was Hungarian money in the Legation. I spent some
of my money that I had in my pockets but I didn't have that much and you had to buy on
the black market, and so I went to the Jewish Council, , and they gave me
some money and then they didn't have any left either. They, they were just in terrible
conditions. They had nothing left to eat themselves. I must uh say that in the month of
August, had fired the Nazi government and one of the first measures that was
taken was that the star be no longer worn and all the racial laws were being dismantled
and brought down, and so many people went back to the villages where they had lived.
Not everyone lived in Budapest. Some of them lived in villages. In Carpetia (ph) for
example, in Buchovina (ph). They were farmers. The, the Jewish, the Jews of that area
were farmers, and so what did the Germans and the Nazis do. They forced uh these Jews
from the countryside to come back to Budapest and...those who had left Budapest...and
they concentrated them in the old ghetto, which could support maybe two, three million
people...not fifty or sixty...two or three thousand people, not fifty or sixty thousand
people, and so there was this black, terrible hunger. There was...there were infections.
There were diseases. They was cold. There was no electricity. There, there was nothing.
They had nothing to eat. And so this uh Jewish Council also ran out of money and once
it ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with what I had I could buy something from
the black market and specifically I had to be careful with...watch the children because we
had two orphanages which were really not ours but one belonged to the International Red
Cross I think and one belonged to the Swedish Red Cross and the Spanish Legation had
been begged to protect, protect and to take care of these two houses, and here I must open
a parenthesis because the truth is the truth after all. On the black market I bought
condensed milk with the symbol of the International Red Cross. And we had uh...it was
very expensive. We had to pay for it dearly on the black market, but there were many
children. There were children in the two orphanages and there were children in the
houses, the protected houses. And since the Jewish Council which whose name was
; , which means Jewish Council, since this uh Council didn't have any
money left, wasn't giving any money any more, since I had nominated a committee for
each house to maintain the discipline and hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I
charged these committees to spy uh financially, economically. They said...they would tell
me which people could give money. And so I went to these people...not every day...and I
said givemeathousand _. You can give me five thousand, near five...according to
their capabilities. And these people gave me money. But somebody would say, why. Why
should I give you money? And I would say because you have the money. We need the
money. I don't have any. The Legation doesn't have any. What...what will we use to buy
food with. And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the committee
undertook that there were some families that had reserves of food that were bountiful and
there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the black market anymore, and

so I had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these families had. And this food was
distributed because I don't know what would have happened. There would have been
fights because hunger is hunger. A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her
child...uh she sees the child get weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of killing
and she's right, don't you think? And so therefore with these stories...uh these stories
occurred day after day, week after week, and we finally come to the day of Christmas
Eve, which was a terrible day...because the Russians, Russia and Spain considered
themselves in a state of war. Anyhow, I always kept quiet. Yes...yes... it's started. Uh
Christmas Day I remember that I left. On Christmas Eve, on Christmas Eve I left. I spent
uh...that evening and I went to the villa in Budapest. It was in late afternoon and I thought
that I would eat there but when I arrived in the neighborhood I found that there were
elements of the Hungarian army with machine guns and other arms and so forth, and they
told me that it's not possible to pass through because the Russians are very close, three
hundred, four hundred meters away, and I told them that I have to go. I'm, I'm a diplomat
and I have to go to the, all the people of the Spanish Legation, which was very close, a
hundred meters from here, and they said OK, we'll give you fifteen minutes and then you
have to come back. Otherwise it's uh your business. I said OK. So I went and I found that
everything was topsy-turvy. We had sixty refugees in the villa of the Legation and, and I
understood that I didn't have time to have lunch there, that I had to go back to Budapest.
They, they had made a big Christmas tree for me. It was big because they had...they cut it
down from the park and it was six or seven meters high and you would enter the first
floor and you would go down to the second...the living room and it was all...it was a
Christmas tree that was, that took up two floors and was full of presents and I looked at
the Christmas tree and I didn't even take my presents, because I said if I take my stuff, I
am letting them know that the Russians are here, that there's going to be some fighting
here and that we don't know what the Germans would have done and so forth and so I
just said goodbye to everyone and I left. And I went back to Budapest. I was...didn't go
back to the villa because the next day it was burnt by a German grenade. That evening,
which was Christmas Eve, which is a holiday in Spain too...it's...there's a big supper on
Christmas Eve and I had been invited to lunch at the __ Hotel by the Secretary of the
Nazi Party, the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I feared that with this invitation he wanted to
ask me to pay for the Spanish passports. They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I
gave the Spanish passports to them. That's now true. It's not true. If they had asked it
from me, I don't know what I would have done. I would have judged...assessed the
situation at the time and I would have uh dealt and I would have...uh practically I would
have sold the passports in exchange for guarantees for security for the protected people.
So we lunched together and we spoke about everything except politics. We joked around,
and at a certain point we had finished our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him,
gave the minister something...just like in the movies. And I think that this...on this piece
of paper there was written that he had to leave and in fact he told me...look, I'm sorry but
Ihave to leave and so forth. So we left. And I was happy because he didn't ask me
anything. He didn't...he didn't ask anything about the passport, which was a delicate
question to hand over a passport. Yes, I did have passports to give, but if if the question
became known and the Spanish government found out that that the passport had been
given to a Nazi minister, the Spanish government undoubtedly would have reacted, and
they undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authorize this. He's not authorized to

give out passports, so I was glad that he didn't ask me anything. Even though there are
Hungarian newspapers that say that I gave uh passports to Nazi ministers, that's not true.
In fact, during the trials they didn't bring this up, so I was alone because I didn't even
want an escort that evening. I said I was going to go to dinner that evening and he
would...and I just need someone to take me to some...to the Legation or to my apartment
and that's all, because I had many places where I could go and sleep. At a certain point, I
was stopped by a group of Hungarian Nazis, Nazis, who asked me to see my passport and
they said that this passport and diplomatic pass are no longer valid. And during this
conversation I saw on the other side of the street a uh army elements, a pa...army patrol,
and so I called them and the patrol came and it was commanded by a lieutenant who
commanded thirty men or so, and I said look, these people want to arrest me and this is
my name. These are my documents and papers and so they said no, no, no, no. You can't
touch this man. He's a diplomat. He represents Spain and so he sent them away, and so
they escorted me home. And I decided that I would go spend the night in an apartment in
uh ,in Street, Street. I invited this lieutenant to come and have
a drink with me and he told me, declared to me that they were about to close...they were
about to close the neighborhood and there was only one street open left, and that's why I
understood that the minister who had been in such a hurry to leave. And so the next
morning I tried to get in touch with the villa, because I had left two cars there and I
needed those cars. One belonged to Sanspritz and another had been lent to me that
morning by an Italian citizen because the only two cars that I had in the Legation were
not working, and so he lent me this car and the next day the car was burnt in the village.
The whole villa was destroyed. Nothing was left. Of my stuff, one girl saved five
handkerchiefs that she had wanted to save me, but she didn't want to hang them on the
tree. She didn't want to hang the handkerchiefs on the tree with everything else and this
girl came to the house at the last minute before the house burnt and she uh got the box
with the handkerchiefs and after three months, she came to Budapest to give me the
handkerchiefs. That morning...that Christmas morning was a terrible morning. Spain...I
don't know for what reasons...wanted uh cared for the Slovak minister. Bohemia had been
annexed by Germany but Slovakia was independent and so they had a diplomatic
representative in Budapest. This diplomatic representative who had contacts with the
Spaniards...I don't know how...I don't remember...but anyhow with, together with the
attorney Fakash went to look for him to bring him to the Legation. We found him. He
was dead, in the garden before the gate of the Legation. The Nazis had killed him because
they had discovered that he was anti-Nazi. When I returned they wanted to take attorney
Fakash away from me. They wanted him to leave the car and if he left the car, that was
the end. I was able to bring him back to the Legation and I told him you're not to leave
this Legation again. I will go alone. I will be escorted by the police forces. I will go alone
and you remain here because your life is in danger. So I...the days...that's how the days
passed after Christmas. By New Year's Eve it was calm, especially in the evening. We
even danced...sure...we danced in the basement of the Legation. We even brought out
some bottles of Spanish wine. There were hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious
Spanish wine from , bottles of wine from these areas in Spain which is
precious wine. I liked it anyhow and I used to drink it all the time in Spain. And they
danced. They even danced. I was happy because these people who were in hiding...and
they were all Jews except for one who said he was a priest, but I don't think he was a

priest. I think that he was a priest who was pretending...uh a Jew who was pretending to
be a priest I think, but I never saw him again these are not details that really interested me
since they did not come into the offices. They came only for...in the last moment when
we were asleep in the basement together and that's when we had this party and that's
when I saw them. I, I always thought...I'm actually glad that I didn't have any contact
with them. You know, we'd just say hello and good evening and that's it. There was a
Hungarian diplomat, , who had a wife and daughter...uh many people. There
was sixty or so people, and they even danced. And then the situation began to get worse.
So we still continued to issue those letters of protection because the Nazis, Hungarian
Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I always refer to the
Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what did I want to say...where was I...where was
I...OK. The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it
seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the international ghetto and
take them to the old grand ghetto and deport them. I didn't believe in such a thing because
they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for
the seized (ph) capital, they were saying that he was going to burn the ghetto and and kill
all the Jews. This would have been the final Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in
such a thing. In the meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was
always someone who felt threatened because they had inspected the house next door or
the apartment above...you know how it is. So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or
the sixth of January...I don't remember exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January,
I was crossing Mussolini Square to go to the orphanages which were very nearby and I
saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who are these Jews? And they say, these
are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews. That night, during that during the night the Portuguese
minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume the responsibility for the
Portuguese Legation and I told him no, that if there is something, if there is something...if
he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands I I
didn't...1 couldn't assume any more responsibilities. I'd had enough of my own, and so I
saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had
already, man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything
because he was the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen. He was the
‘ was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was
acting as Portuguese minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything,
that he was stepping back and that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more.
So I wrote a letter to this minister and I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that
I didn't believe in them, that please to deny these rumors but he didn't respond and after
two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned and I said that I was about to come to
see him...that I would come see him the next day and I think that was January 8 or the 7th
or the 8th of January. Probably the 8th. Perhaps even in the night. Who knows. Anyway,
it's not that important. So he went there that day. I went because I had heard these rumors
which were more and more prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the column of the
Portuguese Jews I was struck and I went and I found in uh the chamber of the city hall
Budapest, in the basement, I found Wallenberg, the Swede, and who was Swiss.
And I told them I'm going to go inside first because I have an appointment. My
appointment...it hadn't really been conferred to me that I had an appointment but uh and
when I return from the appointment then we can all talk together. The colonel uh who is

head of the gendarmerie, accompanied me to the minister's office. It was a
little office in the basement and this colonel three days later killed himself by the way. He
saw that everything was lost. He'd been compromised because of the Jewish question and
so he killed himself. Sada (ph) was his name. Colonel Sada and he was the head of the
whole gendarmerie of Hungary at that time, so I went to this minister that I had seen, not
known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said yes. He wanted to solve the
Jewish question by killing everyone. And so I started to say do you realize what's
happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people will
have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you
know...I even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind,
____ people...anything to move him. I even cried. Uh but he was tough so I didn't know
what to do anymore. I, I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I
told him, look...if within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from
me a guarantee that all is calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the
Hungarian government have been respected because during the period between October,
November and December we had come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs
Minister and the Hungarian government...we had reached an agreement and received
guarantees. Not only that but the Hungarian government wanted to send a diplomatic
representative to Madrid in order to, to tie diplomatic relations with the Anglo-Americans
to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the Spanish government who didn't
wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear anything about it. The, the uh
credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh this...what credentials
are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials to Madrid. It
was for a certain Colonel . I didn't transmit them because if I did the Spanish
government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they
didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish
government kept quiet. They kept quiet. Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last
night told me that he saw in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government
which asked the Spanish government if I was really the charge d'affaires. The Spanish
government never answered. The Spanish ambassador told me that last night. They
never...the Spanish government never responded to these telegrams. I understood
naturally, slowly...I slowly understood why we had a preferential treatment with the
Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have diplomatic relations
with Spain to contact the Anglo-Americans. We understood it late, but we understood it.
If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already talking
about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we
would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I
think but uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all. The Spanish ambassador told
me not that...not everyone is intelligent. I wasn't intelligent. The other the other guy also
wasn't intelligent so uh what do you want. So I told him that if within forty-five hours the
Spanish government doesn't get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order
the three thousand Hungarian citizens which are, who are in, in Spain will be
interned...actually there were really a hundred including the diplomats...and their goods
will be seized and this, the Spanish government will...or ask the Brazilian government
and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those Hungarian citizens who were
in Brazil and Paraguay. So this minister said a friendly government like the Spanish

government would do such a thing? What friendly government? If you are against us,
you're the ones who are against us. This is what we want. We want to protect these Jews.
You don't want to do it, so you are coming against our interests and against our policy
and against our interests and our wishes, so how can you say that we are friends. We're
friends if you say, if you do what we want. To sum it up he said, OK. The Spaniards are,
are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no,
and I became uh demanding in that moment. I said no. All...everyone or nobody. All of
those in the international ghetto must remain where they are or all those in the common
ghetto must be, must have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have
to survive too because what would what would happen of the Hungarian people, so I
repeated to him again and all the stories about vendettas, terrible vendettas and uh the
Anglo-Americans uh who would come to bombard the city and so forth and so on. And
so we agreed that everything would have uh occurred in that way. When I left the office I
found Wallenberg and were still there, and I explained the situation to them and I
said I was able to obtain this and that. When you do inside I don't know what you can ask
of this minister, but please don't uh do anything to undermine this agreement that we've
just come to. Otherwise nothing more...so Wallenberg asked me for political asylum in
the Spanish Legation and I said fine, I'll wait for you. You go to the Legation. I'll wait for
you and I'm going to have to go find something in the neighborhood and then I'll I'll meet
you there at the Legation. He said no. I will come with my car in the afternoon. I'll give
you the car because I know you need a car, and I'll come. I never saw him again. Never
saw him again. I know that on the 18th he...on the morning of the 18th he wason |
Street. I know this for sure, and he had left the house at ten in the morning to go I don't
know where. From then on he disappeared. Now since the since historians say that on the
16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there. I
say that's not true because on the morning of the 18th he was in Budapest in the on the
___ Street. means king. I don't know really...l saw him maybe a dozen times. I
spoke to him specifically during the meetings with diplomats. I never saw him otherwise.
From the beginning of December, all the diplomats, mutual diplomats, had disappeared.
He couldn't find any of them. Wallenberg... when I saw Wallenberg at city hall in
Budapest on the meeting, the day that I met , uh I'd seen him, besides that time, I'd
seen him on December 22nd at the uh Papal Nuncio (ph) where he had signed a
document uh to protest uh and this was in favor of women and I remember that he did not
sign that document because he couldn't sign it because he was a secretary and Minister
Danielson, his boss, was there. The ambassador. His, his boss wasn't there at that time.
Uh that morning during the meeting I told the Archbishop Angelo I would like to
speak privately with you and so we went into another office and so I told him look...I
started speaking to him in Italian. In the meetings we always spoke in French. Uh I
started speaking in Italian. I said look, I'm not a Spaniard. I'm Italian and I'm close to you
because I'm, I was born in Komo (ph) and he had also been born close to Komo. He said
oh, you're...you're kidding. You're joking. I said no, no. I'm not kidding. This is the truth.
I tell you this because if something would ever happen to me, you...I want you to know
this so that you can uh tell my relatives. He told me, I remember, don't tell ‘
was his secretary because that guy is very picky. He can...he might become very angry,
might cause trouble. I said no no. I won't tell . And this...practically this is where
the story ends because after a few days...no, actually the next morning, Mr. Mr.

_____ sent an employee to ask for telegrams to send to Madrid because we didn't have a
radio. The capital was under siege and it wasn't...we couldn't communicate with Vienna.
Normally you could telephone Vienna, Vienna telephoned Berlin, and Berlin via radio
communicated to Madrid. But this...it was no longer possible to use the phone. And so I
sent this employee to ask for a telegram which uh I asked him to send via radio radio
because he had a radio. Uh Mr. Fakash, Attorney Fakash who was an attorney who was
very picky, an old-timer, uh told me that I shouldn't send the telegram and I told him
look, if I don't send the telegram as soon as this employee goes back to Minister 6
everything will fall apart. If we send the telegram we'll save four or five days. We'll gain
four or five days because the Spanish government will of course have to reflect on this
before responding. They're not going to respond immediately obviously. The telegram
will be send today. I don't know if it'll arrive immediately in Madrid and who will receive
it in Madrid. It has to be sent to Bern and this takes time. I wrote to Bern. I wrote to the
embassy in Bern. After two or three or four days the...Madrid sent its response thanking
uh thanks and it said that it was sure that the Hungarian government would have
respected the agreements and so forth and so on. The employee came to deliver the
telegram himself and he said that the minister was very satisfied with the telegram and so
forth. And then one time something happened which is a little bit funny but at the same
time it uh it's...I don't want to say fear but it gave me, made me a little bit anxious. I went
to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. This was at the end of December. I think before
Christmas I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry and I entered the antechamber where the
secre...permanent secretary had his office. He was like a Vice Minister with whom I'd
had contact. His name was , and I saw that there were two men seated on a couch
who were waiting and one of them I I recognized. He was the Chancellor of the Italian
Legation, the Royal Italian Legation, and the other gentleman I didn't know who he was,
so I very boldly...I had to very boldly salute them like this and instead of going to the
secretary who sort of looked at me with surprise, I went to to the door. I pretended to
knock. I went inside and to see this Vice Minister. I did what I had to do and after
four...after fifteen minutes or so I left. I said goodbye to the young lady and I made aa
vague signal with my hand like this and I left. But once I arrived in the in the hallway I
really came back and I started to eaves...eavesdrop and I heard that these two people
entered the office and entered the Vice Minister's office so I entered the area too, and I
asked Mrs...the young lady...and I said, oh I think I recognize these two men and she said
the big man is Minister Gratanzi (ph) of the Social Republic of Italy and the other is his
secretary. He was the he was a fascist minister, the Social Republic...the Fascist Social
Republic. On the 16th...in the meantime between the...on the 13th it wasn't possible to
leave the Legation anymore. We still had telephone communications with which I could
control or check on the various houses, not directly because there were no phones in the
houses but there were Christians who lived uh in front of the houses or next to them, the
houses, and they had agreed to telephone to us if there was danger and for example with
Eva Long (ph) on the evening of January 3rd or 4th or 5th or whatever it was. I think she
told me even...I think she even told me...anyway they, they remember more than I do.
She called me and I went over there at three in the morning. Anyhow, ;

. There wasn't...no...it wasn't just that time. That happened many times, ten or
fifteen times. Almost every evening I had to get up and go because the Nazis wanted to
come and take them away, to take the Jews away from the houses. .. Speaking. I

told them that we had agreements with the Hungarian government and so forth and so on
and in the meantime somebody well from my entourage...I always had an entourage. I
always had four police officers and two employees of the security office and in reality I
always traveled with two people but...two policemen and two public security people, and
they never wanted to leave my side and when I left there were two policemen who left
and the Legation too...I...I felt like I was a medieval cavalier with the flag and the banner
whenever I traveled with them. But anyway this normally happened at night and I would
go on foot because it was dangerous to go by car at night. There weren't very many lights.
But anyhow that night, that last night that I went to Eva Long in let's say Eva Long's
house...I didn't know Eva Long at the time. I met her only three years ago. I...] arrived
five minutes after a man had thrown himself out of the window from the fifth floor and
you asked me how I, how could I prevent them from taking them away and I would tell
them that we had agreements and then at the same time one of my escorts would go to a
telephone and telephone the police commando and the Colonel would intervene.
This is someone who had helped me, because I had contacts with everyone, with Nazis,
non-Nazis. It doesn't matter that he was a Nazi who...he was a Nazi but he was useful so
I had contacts with him and there was a Hungarian Nazi, a young guy with a beard. If I
asked him for something, he would do it for me. You understand. Now I had contacts
with him. I had contacts with everyone. Whoever happened to be there, I had contacts
with because that's how you had to operate. Experience taught me that everyone can be
useful. There's some who do big favors and some who do smaller favors. Some could
intervene for this and some could intervene for that reason. The Foreign Affairs Minister
could intervene for that and the Interior Minister could intervene for this and the Nazi
Party for another reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on the street
where the Legation was...at the very end of the street...the street was three hundred
meters long, there was a Russian tank with the mouth of the cannon facing the street
which would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dared to leave and go on the
street. In order to cross the street from the Legation to the __—« Paraguayan Legation
which was...you had to open the door and dash, make a dash to get to the other side. And
as soon as you did the, the tank would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was in
telephone contact with the houses because as I said there were always Christian friends
who had telephones in nearing the houses who were called. They saw something
abnormal. For example, that night they called...I don't know who they called. After half
an hour I arrived and I saw that they were about to take them away. I stopped everything
but unfortunately I arrived five minutes after a man threw himself out of a window on the
fifth floor. I thought it was a woman, but Eva Long told me that it was a man. When I
arrived they had already covered the body. The police had covered the body. And I
thought it was a woman but in...it was a man. And so on the 16th uh you arrived in my
area, on my street and until the afternoon, in the afternoon, up until the afternoon they
had respected extra-territory . We took the flag down. We put the Swedish flag up.
We took the emblem, the Spanish emblem down and put the Swedish emblem because
Sweden was supposed to protect Spain's interests. No...because that's the way it's done.
When one nation cannot have relations with another nation, another nation which can
have relations, it can intervene to protect the interests and in fact I think that Sweden was
able to...after ten or twelve days of the Russian's arrival, to...was able to empty the
building, the Spanish building. Of that I'm not really sure because I was in hiding. I

couldn't do anything more. As I was telling you about Wallenberg, on the morning of the
18th, the Russians took me and they put me to sweep the streets. Street...] had to
sweep Street. At a certain point I saw in front of a building a man whose name was
who, who, had been my chauffeur and who had been wounded driving my car. I
wasn't there at the time. Uh my...in my position where I was seated uh there was a
policeman who was killed. He...and then the car was taken away and then the car was
found again a few hours later but it was destroyed. This man has been my chauffeur to do
me a favor and at the same time had, he had also, he had had ties with the International
Red Cross because the delegate of the International Red Cross never showed his face.
The human miseries. So I asked him, did you see Wallenberg. He said yes. He's here.
Please, go, go fetch him. I can't move because there's this guy here with a machine gun,
the GBU guy who, who is forcing me to sweep the street. After fifteen minutes or ten
minutes though he came back. He say no, he's gone. He left a few minutes ago, and this is
about eleven in the morning, but from then on nothing more was heard about Wallenberg,
so I, therefore I think that he died or because he was hit by a sniper or because he was hit
by a German grenade. Uh they resisted until the mid-February in the castle of Buda (ph),
in the hills of Buda, I think, or perhaps he met a group of Nazis, Hungarian Nazis, who
recognized him and who killed him on the spot. There were hundreds and hundreds of
bodies buried in the snow in the area of the Spanish Legation, Mussolini Square. I think
that he wanted to cross Street to go to the international ghetto, I think. Or anyhow
such...this...a similar declaration was...I made a similar declaration in 1962 I think after a
request that was made to me by the Swedish Consulate in Milan. Last year Danielson's
widow invited me to her house in the province of Trento (ph). I was at and when
we talked about this issue, she told me that her husband and the Foreign Affairs Minister
never believed that Wallenberg was taken to the Soviet Union, Russia. Anyhow, some
people were interested in blowing up the issue in good faith but then others kept saying
things that were not true. As far as I was concerned that's what happened. I may be wrong
but that's how it was for me. That's what I believe. I remained three or four months until
April, May...five months in Budapest and then the Russians uh kicked every...all the
foreign citizens out. I was trying to get back home but they could have sent us Italians
home with the trains and in ten or twelve hours we would have been to Capezio (ph) or to
or to the other place, what's it called... . Instead they sent us via Bucha ‘
Istanbul and it took ten days of travel in latched up cars and with a hunger that I don't
want to speak about because we didn't even have any money. There was nothing left. I
didn't have anything. I had only... everything... had only what I was wearing the day that
the Russians arrived. Everything had been burnt at the Legation. No...yes...at the villa of
the Spanish Legation in Budapest, at Buda, and everything else was stolen by the
Russians. I didn't even have a shaver to shave. In those days they had...I had a Gillette
shaver. Uh we...when we arrived...when I arrived in Istanbul, I found the...someone who
had the suitcase that once...a suitcase that once had belonged to me and which had also
my shaving kit and I said to him I need my shaving kit. Luckily this person had an extra
shaving kit.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
When I returned to Italy I found that my company had fired me and, and it was an ugly
period and I had to even pay for the car that I had borrowed from an Italian and the car
was then burnt and I had to pay for that car with my money, but anyway it was a bad
period, but anyway I managed. It's difficult when you're forty to change jobs and in a bad
situation as it was in Italy at the time, the War of the Mosques (ph) and so forth. It's hard
to adapt and I once again went to start afresh and to find work. I I adapted. Uh I had
to...in order to put bread on the table, and sometimes I wasn't able to do that perfectly but
after ten years I was successful. My son was born and we'll _ for all the sacrifices. I
was able to raise him and to settle, settle him and now I consider that I'm uh I'm all
settled. I can't say that I am uh I'm rich, but I live, live. I live and I'm happy this way.
Especially because all of those people who had been helped by me uh looked for me and
they celebrated me. They made me come to Washington. You're welcomed. If in the
future, if you need any explanations on anything, we can correspond, but you must write
in Italian. . don't know what happened. There's a lady here,
Magadelena (ph), who knew him well. She asked me the same thing. What happened?
And I say at the end of November, I believe, before Sanspritz left, he disappeared. Since
he was trying to get to home in Spain, perhaps he was able with the passport that he had,
perhaps he was able to go to Spain. It was difficult because he was a deserter of the Blue
Division of Spain which was fighting with the Germans. He had fought in these Divisions
next to, with the Germans. I don't...I can't...I've tried to find out because he was a very
nice guy. He was young. He was probably twenty-two, maybe twenty-three. He was a
very nice guy. He was very helpful. He, he gave me a hand in...several times for
something. I remember that he came with, he accompanied me. But at the end of
November he disappeared and that day we didn't see him again. Yes. 5
Italian. There are some people who helped me morally, who lives in Germany now and
morally...gave me moral support. And then there was Attorney Fakash who unfortunately
died the day that the Russians entered the city. That was so unlucky for him. He had a
beautiful daughter who was ten years old. He was married. He was Jewish, but I think
that he converted because he married a princess, from Vienna. Not a royal
princess. She had the title of a princess but it wasn't a royal title. I don't know exactly
what...Mrs. . No, why. I told you that she helped me morally. Thanks to you.
If in the future you need some explanations, I'd love to send, I'd love to send. You can
correspond with me in Italy, but please write in Italian so that I don't need to have it
translated and so forth. Let me guess. There were, there are many other things that I could
tell. I keep saying that the day...I keep saying that the work did not involve just writing
those letters of protection. Once those letters were written, the work to protect these
people just got started because they had to be protected day and night. When I
slept...Italian..

GIORGIO PERLASCA
September 5, 1990
Tape #1
Question: Would you tell me your name please?
Answer: My name is George Perlasca.
Question: And you were born where?
Answer: I was born in Komo (ph) on January 31st, 1910.
Question:...
Answer: You're welcome.
Question:...
Answer: It's too much for my personality.
Question: Can you tell us what happened to you when you were released from released from
internment and you came back to Budapest in 1944?
Answer: I escaped on October 13th, 1944. It wasn't an internment camp. I had my own room.
Each person had his own room. We ate three times a day and then we had tea in the afternoon
and they even gave us cigarettes, soap and toothpaste and even money. And this was according
to the Geneva Convention because I was aggregated to the Italian commercial delegation and
therefore I had uh I was uh I could uh have diplomatic uh treatment. Uh the 13th I left. The 13th
of October and I arrived in Budapest that evening and the next day I don't know what I did but
on the 15th the armistice was proclaimed between Hungary, Russia, Great Britain and America.
This was an announcement, a terrible announcement because no one was prepared for it except a
few people who, who knew questions of state and government. I was surprised. I was having
lunch with an Italian lady who was of the Jewish faith and she was married to an Italian diplomat
and we...she was speechless and I was surprised, and I didn't know what to do. So I, I hid
because the TV was controlled by the Admiral government and everything else fell in the
hands of the Nazis and of the Germans, Hungarian Nazis and the German army and their...and
then I went to hide in a house which belonged to a friend of mine, uh family friends in the
and from this house I went to a hospital to hide because I didn't know where to go

because from the first evening I slept in a friend's house in who gave me the keys to his
apartment. The next day I discovered that the maid was a German, a , and she was pro-
Nazi and therefore I didn't go back to that house because it seemed dangerous to me. After a
couple of days in the hospital, I spent two more days in hiding. I was hidden by the land...by the
landlady in the house where I used to live once upon a time, but then I realized that the Ugandan
Hotel that I knew very well was being emptied because many German officers were leaving with
their suitcases and I went to the keeper of the building and I asked him if he could give me a

room and he said give me a passport and I said I don't have any passport anymore. I don't have
any more documents and he said OK, for two days I'll give you a room and then I...so I didn't
know what to do. And so therefore the next morning I decided to go to the Spanish Legation. It
was probably eight in the morning. I went there and on the way, on the road, and I was on foot,
on__ Street which is a big street, I saw that some Hungarian Nazis were chasing a child who
was probably seven or eight years old. They reached him and one of them shot the child in the
back of the head. I was quite struck by this naturally and I asked a passerby why, what did that
child do? Who is he? And he said he's Jewish. From the roofs of the houses, however, there
were some Jews who were shooting against the Nazis from the rooftop houses. But anyway I
went to the Legation andI found __ who gave me a passport and I...he said come tomorrow
with two photos, and I had two in my pocket which I pulled out, and I gave them to him and then
he gave me the passport. And he also gave me a letter from the Minister of Interior which said
that the Spanish government two years earlier had granted me their citizenship because I had
fought in the civil war and also, the letter also said...and that I had asked for a citizenship and the
letter said that they were not able to locate me and that they now found me and I had to assume
citizenship, Spanish citizenship.
TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
So we were...with this letter 1 went together with the legal attaché..we went to the Minister of
Interior where I changed citizenship. I canceled the Italian one and I assumed Spanish
citizenship. When I returned to the Legation that early morning, it was probably eight or nine
a.m., and it's strange that that morning Sanspritz (ph) got up at eight a.m., but these were very
difficult times and people didn't always go to sleep. I saw...thank you...that there was a lot of
confusion around, surrounding the Legation at the entrance and in the courtyard, and that many
of these people who were there had were wearing the David Star, Star of David, and I asked the
legal attaché what was happening and he said that these were people who are asking for our
protection, protection from the Spanish government but right now we're in difficulty because the
only Christian legation is Sanspritz. And therefore it's impossible to organize an external
protection and it's it doesn't make any sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be
of help, then I...maybe I can do something, so we went to Sanspritz and I told him I'm available
if you need me, and he said yes. Sanspritz said yes but I can't pay you because we don't have any
funds to pay you with and I said I'm not interested because I have enough money to survive on
my own. And so I started immediately. I started working immediately. The first few hours I
must tell the truth....I didn't know what to do and I didn't know where to start, but then after
speaking with uh the attorney Fakash (ph) who was the attorney and also with the Chancellor and
with other people who were there who were all Jews, Fakash, the Chancellor, her son and all of
the refugees and so | realized what could be done. The first thing was to try to get back about
three hundred people who had been protected by Spain. They had about three hundred, only
three hundred at that time because the Hungarian government had said three hundred, and
Sanspritz accepted this decision on behalf of the Spanish government and this is something that I
didn't, didn't accept immediately at first so those first two or three days my job was to try to find
those who had been protected, of the three hundred protected. Of the three hundred I was able to
get a hundred and fifty back and I found them at the uh Merchandise Depot, at the train station
and also by going to the border between Hungary and say Austria and Germany, and those who
had a Spanish ID we were able to bring them back. It seems to me we had rented two trucks but

I don't remember now how many, or we brought them back with the train or we reserved a
special car... I don't really remember how that happened. I was with the car. [hada car. So I
started working. I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if you're going to edit it, edit this
tape... ...So the episode at the train station...you can take it from the other tape and put it
together, piece it together... The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my
eyes to what was happening and to how things were actually really were, at the train station they
were loading train cars with Jews who were being deported because the Hungarian government
said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to give thirty million
uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that wasn't true, that they were
going to work. They were people who were being deported and then we didn't know what would
happen to them in the end, so much so that Eva Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a
laborer. He went on the train but on the trip between Budapest and the border he understood...I
don't know how...but he understood that it was a trick and so he jumped from the train and he
came back to Budapest. And he came back to Budapest to . I don't think that that
building existed yet but anyway he came to one of the Spanish houses, so...this episode of the
two twins...at a certain point there was a column which was going and we were looking to see if
anybody was there with Spanish letters, and I saw two twins, two kids of eleven or twelve years
old. They were very handsome kids, nice kids and they were identical and the more I saw the
more | told myself how is it possible that I, I let them go, and so I told these kids, you see that car
over there. Get in the car. Run to the car. Get into the car. Close the door and then the
chauffeur will know what he has to do. Maybe you would like to hear from me how I could
communicate with these people. At the time I spoke German, French, Spanish, but I could
explain myself, I could express myself in Hungarian for a little bit and perhaps I spoke
Hungarian with these children, but anyhow these kids went. One Gestapo major came to and he
wanted the kids back, and I said no. They were in the car. It's a Spanish car and it had a Spanish
uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license plates and therefore the car was extra(c)territorial
property. He insisted. He took out his gun and then so forth, and next, Wallenberg was next to
me and Wallenberg said...told the major, the German major, look...this man represents Spain.
You can't...you can't commit any violent acts. He said look. He's getting in the way of my work,
and instinctively I replied that you call this work. That's what I asked him. And so he got even
more angry. He wanted the kids back. And L...at that point I saw the situation getting really bad.
I thought my God, this man is crazy. He could shoot us. He had a big gun, a Mauthauser (ph), a
big, big gun, but at that point...we were all yelling. I was screaming. Wallenberg, the
Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss, the Vatican...everyone intervened in the discussion.
There were many loud voices at the same time and so this colonel, a colonel came, an SS colonel
came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what was happening and he asked the major what was
happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said now let it be...their time will come
too for the kids. And so they left. And then I brought these kids home. I brought them to the
Legation and I was surprised to see that they were really a boy and a girl who when they were
fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it was a boy and a girl and they were perfectly identical.
The same height, the same face...everything, everything was identical. This is an episode that
struck me which, which along with the other episode of the child who was killed on the street,
these two episodes made me reflect very much. It's not that...at the time I really wasn't fully
aware of the situation. From the end of March to October 13th, I was not...I had been interned
away from Budapest in the countryside...I continued my work. I stopped looking for the three
hundred people because I got one hundred and fifty back and it seemed have understood that

there was nothing more that could be done and so I started to organize the protection network.
We had a house. I don't remember where it was. (Technical conversation) I don't remember
which one it was but we did have one house. Maybe two houses we had already. Maybe they
were _ wherever Long was...yes, it's perhaps...but anyway that's not important. I started
organizing by issuing hundreds of letters immediately. Letters of protection and I would...I
would let these people come in. We would go to the office and type up these letters. Sanspritz
didn't know anything because we used his signature pad. He didn't know how many. His job
was to keep relations with the Foreign Affairs Minister. So we issued I think more than two
thousand five hundred protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end of October
and November. To be more specific...1 couldn't be more specific than that. I think we maybe
reached three thousand, more or less. It wasn't very easy. Not only...it wasn't sufficient to issue
a letter of protection and to escort these people to their house because they had to be escorted to
a building after all. I had some people who were willing to accompany these people with their
cars uh as the letters of protection were issued. There were cars who were available and who
shuttled back and forth between the Legation and the houses where they were going to live and
they would go back and forth continuously and therefore and so we had to uh provide for
everything. We had to get them settled. Normally these apartments that we would take, we had
to pay the rent, but these are details that are of no importance and perhaps we didn't even pay the
rent. We also had to feed these people and we had to be careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to
take them because they did do that. They did especially they would try to attack those Swedish
houses and Swiss houses because they had a, a system of protection which was not correct. In
other words, they had given, both of those countries had a mixed committee, Jewish and
Christian committee which was responsible for issuing letters of protection. To sum it up these
letters were being sold. The authorities and particularly the Nazis found out about this and so
therefore every day they, they would come and take uh raid the Swiss and the Swedish houses. I
think that as far as I know Sweden issued forty million letters of protection and in its houses it
had maybe three or four thousand people because they would come in the afternoon and the next
day there would be raids, and this is not something that I just heard. They weren't rumors. I saw
them with my very own eyes and with Wallenberg I asked him why did you, why do you do that
kind of stuff. That's not correct. These letters are being sold and everyone knows about it. The
authorities know about it. Anyway, we had to protect to prevent that these people be taken. We
had to protect them. With one excuse or the other the Nazi police...not the regular police...the
regular police would intervene when they had orders but there was also various police forces,
Nazi police forces in various neighborhoods of representing various factions which were
ferocious. They killed. They uh they robbed and that was their goal, and we had to protect the
those who were being protected from themselves because these, these people sometimes lacked
common sense. Sometimes it was useless. It wasn't enough to tell them don't go out of the
houses because if you go out of the house they'll take, they take you away. They put you in the
prisons and the Nazis may even kill you, and to...that will give us more work to do because we'll
have to come and get you and find you and this happened many times. They would go and take
a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find their boyfriend...all these things. Or for whatever
reasons, their own reasons. I even created the committees in each house with three members and
their job was to be concerned about hygiene, discipline, order, and to prevent people from
leaving the houses and going on the streets. They had to remain inside the houses because there
they were safe. If they left the houses, they were no longer safe. They would take their stars off
and they would go outside and there would be Nazis there who would ask them for their papers

and what papers could they show. They didn't have any. If they did, it would be clear that they
were Jews and therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then. And so we had to find
uh food for them and security besides watching. We were pretty lucky. It was a continuous job
because we had to travel throughout the neighborhoods continuously to show the flag, to show
that we were present and continuously...I went at least twice a day and daringly, I went daringly
on the streets and little by little with the with the car...1 would go with the car and so the people
could see the, the uh flag, so the people could see that the car was guarding them, and therefore
and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new houses were organized. We tried with a
hospital too but it was but it failed. The...it was my idea but it was a bad idea. It didn't go well.
So weeks went on. Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were
working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't, I didn't think
that you didn't need to have contacts with the authorities. Quite the contrary. I made as many
contacts as possible. I...one day for example I took ...1 don't know what that is...I took
twenty-five thousand _ to the secretary of the minister who was very... ..oh, money.
OK. This is money that he brought to the Hungarian uh refugees in Transylvania and Russia and
Carpetia and the refugees...and this is money for the children and he was very thankful and every
time, every time I was in the neighborhood where he... went up to see him to say hello to him
and this gave me the possibility to ask him information all the time, how it was going at the
Foreign Affairs Ministry, for example. For example, since Fritz didn't want to go to the
Ministry, since Fritz (ph) never left the Legation to visit a house...he never visited any of the
houses. He didn't know anything. He wasn't interested even in how many signatures were used
with his signature pad because he was a diplomat and he had uh limited vision. He was an old-
timer diplomat. This is a very...what he did was very serious and uh correct but it would have
been a good thing in times of peace and in normal times when the war was not ideological as it
had become, when there was no persecution of the Jews. Not only of Jews but also the uh in
Hungary there were many uh...uh they had orchestras. They played the violins and they had
restaurants and they played the orchestras and with the violins and their famous people...in
Hungary and in Serbia (ph)... . I'm sorry...I can't find the word...you know...these traveling
homeless kind of people...oh...uh... they, they dress in flashy costumes...(gypsies)...
gypsies, gypsies....thank you. Gypsies. Gypsies. Gypsies. I couldn't find the
word...sorry...OK. (Pause) In Belgrade on...day and night I went to restaurants and I had meals
and in the evenings they had orchestras. They were played by the gypsies. And there was a
beautiful restaurant in in Square, where there was a good orchestra and there were a
couple of good violinists. One day they disappeared, in January of '42 I think it was. Yes.
January of 1942 they disappeared. I asked the owner of the restaurant, what happened to the
orchestra, the band. And he said well...at first he didn't really want to answer. He was reticent,
and then he said the Germans took them off, because they are of an inferior race. So they
persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that area were many of them, and the Poles. Not only uh
Jewish Poles but the citizens too, and this is something that I saw. This is not something that I
just heard. I saw it. So, so we...this is how we worked, issuing these letters of protection and
then Sanspritz left. I don't remember if he left the 30th of November or December Ist. Uh it
seems...I think that the ambassador, Spanish ambassador told me November 30th. He told me
November 30th, but I don't know if he's sure about this or not. Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and
that morning there was a reaction on behalf of the Nazis. I found myself that morning, early in
the morning I was called...six in the morning...and I don't remember who called me but they
called me from the Legation to tell me that Sanspritz had left and so I got up and I, I visited the

international ghetto thinking what do I do now? What is the situation? And in a certain sense
the Nazis helped because by...when I went in front of the house of Street, Number
25, where the child was in this house...he reminded me of some details the other day
when I saw him for the first time. He recalled some details that I didn't remember. I saw
besides...speaking of he exaggerates when I say that I uh yelled to the Nazis and said get
out of here. He exaggerates. As a child, he thought that that's what I did but it wasn't quite like
that, but anyhow that's how he saw it. That's his mentality. More or less that's how it was, but I
wasn't screaming. I wasn't yelling. So I saw...I entered this house and I said, what is happening
here. They were...they told us oh they want to take us away. The police want to deport us. And
sure enough the regular police was there. Not the Nazis, the regular police was there which was
commanded by a lieutenant, and I asked this lieutenant, what do you want. I've got to take
everyone away. And I closed the door in front of him. I locked it, and I said look, no one is
leaving. The Spanish flag is here. The Spanish emblem is here. This...we consider this house
extra-territorial property. It wasn't legal. It wasn't right, but what governs such governments,
you could just say...you could make up things like that. It couldn't have been an extra-territorial
house. You needed special permission from the government. The government had not given any
special permission to do that, and so we discussed and we reached an agreement that he would
postpone the...and together we would go to the park, in the center of the park, where there was a
committee composed of various police forces, the Nazi party, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the
Interior Minister and I don't know who else...seven or eight people. And I went there to speak
with these people and I spoke with energy and with boldness because if I went there with my hat
in hand and I said hey, they would say hey, this guy doesn't know what he's doing. You had to
assert yourself, especially with the Hungarians because these people are, are tough people and
you had to be just as tough, and he said...I asked him what's happening, why do you want to take
these uh people away. He said because Sanspritz fled. Who said that he fled? Sanspritz took a
trip. He went to Bern where he is going to meet Spanish, Italian, French, German and Swiss
diplomats to discuss the situation, but then he is coming back. But in the meantime I am his...the
legal representative of the Spanish government and charge d'affaires and I showed him my
passport and my diplomatic pass and so the Foreign Affairs Minister representative said yes, this
man is uh right what he said, so that's the way it was. The only thing is that uh Sanspritz really
did leave. He did flee, and he didn't have any intentions of coming back. So much so that he
didn't even tell me that he was leaving. He didn't tell me anything. Nothing at all. He left. And
I learned about it when he was already at the border. He left at four or five in the morning.
Anyway, but that's not important. Perhaps it was a good thing. It was a good thing, because the
Nazis uh had invaded that house and it gave me the opportunity to present myself as the
successor to the man who they thought had escaped, so the representative of the Foreign Affairs
Ministry said OK. You're right. The situation is legal. Uh and I said look, there's a flag at the
Legation. There's a flag at all the houses too, and he said...we had an agreement that after two or
three days I would go to the Foreign Affairs Minister Ministry to clarify the Spanish position and
in fact this is what happened, but when I went back to the Legation, I found that the Swedish
Danielson (ph) Minister who was Wallenberg's boss had been to the Legation. Danielson wanted
to get some money...some Swiss francs. They're about seventeen thousand Swiss francs which
were in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I protested at...this is ____ who is the Chancellor, and I
said what do we do now. We still hadsome _, some money left and not very much. She
didn't know what to do and she said that he said that he would send a secretary every morning, a
Swedish secretary to see that everything was uh alright, and I said no, please, don't do that. I

called Minister Danielson. I begged him not to send anyone and that and that I would go and see
him later on to explain the situation and I'm I went probably the next day or so, because if
Sweden uh protected the interest of the Spanish Legation, that meant that the interest of the
Spanish Legation would no longer exist. So we continued to work. . The situation in
the houses came back to normal and while I was there in the park I saw that there was a column
of Jews that were being deported and I saw that someone was waving and so I went to see and I
saw that these were some of the people protected from another houses of the same street,
the _ Street, of Number 33 which was very close, and so I made them give me back. The
situation in the houses was probably, was pretty normal and peaceful. I don't know what those
questions refer to. (He hasn't understood the question.) There were...you mean...are you
referring to the quantity of people who were there, the sleeping conditions, the eating
conditions...what are you referring to? . In during December, the first ten days of
December, we took some other houses...the last two houses, it seems to me. But the...from a
point of view of the living conditions it was a very difficult situation and the house, there
were five hundred people. ____ told me that they slept on the steps. I don't remember exactly
even though there was a committee that held the list of all the people who arrived every day, but
I don't remember how many there were exactly, because...1 must step forward here. The morning
that the Russians arrived, I burnt everything, even the lists of those who were protected because
you never know. If they fall in the hands of the Russians or the GPU...you don't know how they
could have interpreted this fact, so we destroyed everything. The Chancellor didn't want to. She
wanted to save a few things, and I said no. Everything will be destroyed because nothing shall
be left in the hands of the Russians because the Russians, the same day entered the Legation as I
expected, had predicted. And then they uh then they burnt it...they damaged it but I left. The
situation was difficult. As far as living conditions it was also difficult for the food. It was
difficult for the hygienic conditions. It was difficult to find medicines. There was a difficult
time, for example, because they had tried to close the water supply in some of the houses. The
Nazis had tried to do this and so I protested with vigor. I went to the police commander and I
demanded that the water be returned. These things cannot be done because if there is a
protection, then these people must have the necessary elements to survive. If there is no water, I
don't know what would have happened. With five hundred people and, and if it were sixty or
seventy...I don't know how, what would have happened. And then there was the problem of
food. We had to feed these people. At a certain point there was no more money left from the
Legation...this was Hungarian money in the Legation. I spent some of my money that I had in
my pockets but I didn't have that much and you had to buy on the black market, and so I went to
the Jewish Council, , and they gave me some money and then they didn't have any
left either. They, they were just in terrible conditions. They had nothing left to eat themselves. I
must uh say that in the month of August, had fired the Nazi government and one of the
first measures that was taken was that the star be no longer worn and all the racial laws were
being dismantled and brought down, and so many people went back to the villages where they
had lived. Not everyone lived in Budapest. Some of them lived in villages. In Carpetia (ph) for
example, in Buchovina (ph). They were farmers. The, the Jewish, the Jews of that area were
farmers, and so what did the Germans and the Nazis do. They forced uh these Jews from the
countryside to come back to Budapest and...those who had left Budapest...and they concentrated
them in the old ghetto, which could support maybe two, three million people...not fifty or
sixty...two or three thousand people, not fifty or sixty thousand people, and so there was this
black, terrible hunger. There was...there were infections. There were diseases. They was cold.

There was no electricity. There, there was nothing. They had nothing to eat. And so this uh
Jewish Council also ran out of money and once it ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with
what I had I could buy something from the black market and specifically I had to be careful
with...watch the children because we had two orphanages which were really not ours but one
belonged to the International Red Cross I think and one belonged to the Swedish Red Cross and
the Spanish Legation had been begged to protect, protect and to take care of these two houses,
and here I must open a parenthesis because the truth is the truth after all. On the black market I
bought condensed milk with the symbol of the International Red Cross. And we had uh...it was
very expensive. We had to pay for it dearly on the black market, but there were many children.
There were children in the two orphanages and there were children in the houses, the protected
houses. And since the Jewish Council which whose name was > , which
means Jewish Council, since this uh Council didn't have any money left, wasn't giving any
money any more, since I had nominated a committee for each house to maintain the discipline
and hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I charged these committees to spy uh financially,
economically. They said...they would tell me which people could give money. And so I went to
these people...not every day...and I said give mea thousand __. _You can give me five
thousand, near five...according to their capabilities. And these people gave me money. But
somebody would say, why. Why should I give you money? And I would say because you have
the money. We need the money. I don't have any. The Legation doesn't have any. What...what
will we use to buy food with. And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the
committee undertook that there were some families that had reserves of food that were bountiful
and there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the black market anymore, and so I
had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these families had. And this food was distributed
because I don't know what would have happened. There would have been fights because hunger
is hunger. A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her child...uh she sees the child get
weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of killing and she's right, don't you think? And so
therefore with these stories...uh these stories occurred day after day, week after week, and we
finally come to the day of Christmas Eve, which was a terrible day.

Tape #2
...because the Russians, Russia and Spain considered themselves in a state of war. Anyhow, I
always kept quiet. Yes...yes...it's started. Uh Christmas Day I remember that I left. On
Christmas Eve, on Christmas Eve I left. I spent uh...that evening and I went to the villa in
Budapest. It was in late afternoon and I thought that I would eat there but when I arrived in the
neighborhood I found that there were elements of the Hungarian army with machine guns and
other arms and so forth, and they told me that it's not possible to pass through because the
Russians are very close, three hundred, four hundred meters away, and I told them that I have to
go. I'm, I'ma diplomat and I have to go to the, all the people of the Spanish Legation, which was
very close, a hundred meters from here, and they said OK, we'll give you fifteen minutes and
then you have to come back. Otherwise it's uh your business. I said OK. So I went and I found
that everything was topsy-turvy. We had sixty refugees in the villa of the Legation and, and I
understood that I didn't have time to have lunch there, that I had to go back to Budapest. They,
they had made a big Christmas tree for me. It was big because they had...they cut it down from
the park and it was six or seven meters high and you would enter the first floor and you would go
down to the second...the living room and it was all...it was a Christmas tree that was, that took up
two floors and was full of presents and I looked at the Christmas tree and I didn't even take my
presents, because I said if I take my stuff, I am letting them know that the Russians are here, that
there's going to be some fighting here and that we don't know what the Germans would have
done and so forth and so I just said goodbye to everyone and I left. And I went back to
Budapest. I was...didn't go back to the villa because the next day it was burnt by a German
grenade. That evening, which was Christmas Eve, which is a holiday in Spain too...it's...there's a
big supper on Christmas Eve and I had been invited to lunch at the __ Hotel by the Secretary
of the Nazi Party, the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I feared that with this invitation he wanted to
ask me to pay for the Spanish passports. They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I gave
the Spanish passports to them. That's now true. It's not true. If they had asked it from me, I
don't know what I would have done. I would have judged...assessed the situation at the time and
I would have uh dealt and I would have...uh practically I would have sold the passports in
exchange for guarantees for security for the protected people. So we lunched together and we
spoke about everything except politics. We joked around, and at a certain point we had finished
our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him, gave the minister something...just like in the
movies. And I think that this...on this piece of paper there was written that he had to leave and in
fact he told me...look, I'm sorry but I have to leave and so forth. So we left. And I was happy
because he didn't ask me anything. He didn't...he didn't ask anything about the passport, which
was a delicate question to hand over a passport. Yes, I did have passports to give, but if, if the
question became known and the Spanish government found out that that the passport had been
given to a Nazi minister, the Spanish government undoubtedly would have reacted, and they
undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authorize this. He's not authorized to give out
passports, so I was glad that he didn't ask me anything. Even though there are Hungarian
newspapers that say that I gave uh passports to Nazi ministers, that's not true. In fact, during the
trials they didn't bring this up, so I was alone because I didn't even want an escort that evening. I
said I was going to go to dinner that evening and he would...and I just need someone to take me
to some...to the Legation or to my apartment and that's all, because I had many places where I
could go and sleep. At a certain point, I was stopped by a group of Hungarian Nazis, Nazis, who
asked me to see my passport and they said that this passport and diplomatic pass are no longer

valid. And during this conversation I saw on the other side of the street a uh army elements, a
pa...army patrol, and so I called them and the patrol came and it was commanded by a lieutenant
who commanded thirty men or so, and I said look, these people want to arrest me and this is my
name. These are my documents and papers and so they said no, no, no, no. You can't touch this
man. He's a diplomat. He represents Spain and so he sent them away, and so they escorted me
home. And I decided that I would go spend the night in an apartment in uh ,in
Street, Street. I invited this lieutenant to come and have a drink with me and he told
me, declared to me that they were about to close...they were about to close the neighborhood and
there was only one street open left, and that's why I understood that the minister who had been in
such a hurry to leave. And so the next morning I tried to get in touch with the villa, because I
had left two cars there and I needed those cars. One belonged to Sanspritz and another had been
lent to me that morning by an Italian citizen because the only two cars that I had in the Legation
were not working, and so he lent me this car and the next day the car was burnt in the village.
The whole villa was destroyed. Nothing was left. Of my stuff, one girl saved five handkerchiefs
that she had wanted to save me, but she didn't want to hang them on the tree. She didn't want to
hang the handkerchiefs on the tree with everything else and this girl came to the house at the last
minute before the house burnt and she uh got the box with the handkerchiefs and after three
months, she came to Budapest to give me the handkerchiefs. That morning...that Christmas
morning was a terrible morning. Spain...I don't know for what reasons...wanted uh cared for the
Slovak minister. Bohemia had been annexed by Germany but Slovakia was independent and so
they had a diplomatic representative in Budapest. This diplomatic representative who had
contacts with the Spaniards... don't know how...I don't remember...but anyhow with, together
with the attorney Fakash went to look for him to bring him to the Legation. We found him. He
was dead, in the garden before the gate of the Legation. The Nazis had killed him because they
had discovered that he was anti-Nazi. When I returned they wanted to take attorney Fakash
away from me. They wanted him to leave the car and if he left the car, that was the end. I was
able to bring him back to the Legation and I told him you're not to leave this Legation again. I
will go alone. I will be escorted by the police forces. I will go alone and you remain here
because your life is in danger. So I...the days...that's how the days passed after Christmas. By
New Year's Eve it was calm, especially in the evening. We even danced...sure...we danced in the
basement of the Legation. We even brought out some bottles of Spanish wine. There were
hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious Spanish wine from , bottles of wine
from these areas in Spain which is precious wine. I liked it anyhow and I used to drink it all the
time in Spain. And they danced. They even danced. I was happy because these people who
were in hiding...and they were all Jews except for one who said he was a priest, but I don't think
he was a priest. I think that he was a priest who was pretending...uh a Jew who was pretending
to be a priest I think, but I never saw him again these are not details that really interested me
since they did not come into the offices. They came only for...in the last moment when we were
asleep in the basement together and that's when we had this party and that's when I saw them. II
always thought...I'm actually glad that I didn't have any contact with them. You know, we'd just
say hello and good evening and that's it. There was a Hungarian diplomat, , who had a
wife and daughter...uh many people. There was sixty or so people, and they even danced. And
then the situation began to get worse. So we still continued to issue those letters of protection
because the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I
always refer to the Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what did I want to say...where was
I...where was L...OK. The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it

seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the international ghetto and take them
to the old grand ghetto and deport them. I didn't believe in such a thing because they were
saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for the seized (ph)
capital, they were saying that he was going to burn the ghetto and ,and kill all the Jews. This
would have been the final Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in such a thing. In the
meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was always someone who felt
threatened because they had inspected the house next door or the apartment above...you know
how it is. So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or the sixth of January...I don't remember
exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January, I was crossing Mussolini Square to go to the
orphanages which were very nearby and I saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who
are these Jews? And they say, these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews. That night, during that
during the night the Portuguese minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume
the responsibility for the Portuguese Legation and I told him no, that if there is something, if
there is something...if he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as
it stands I, I didn't... couldn't assume any more responsibilities. I'd had enough of my own, and
so I saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had already,
man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything because he was
the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen. He was the :
was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese
minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything, that he was stepping back and
that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more. So I wrote a letter to this minister and
I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that I didn't believe in them, that please to deny
these rumors but he didn't respond and after two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned
and I said that I was about to come to see him...that I would come see him the next day and I
think that was January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of January. Probably the 8th. Perhaps even in the
night. Who knows. Anyway, it's not that important. So he went there that day. I went because I
had heard these rumors which were more and more prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the
column of the Portuguese Jews I was struck and I went and I found in uh the chamber of the city
hall Budapest, in the basement, I found Wallenberg, the Swede, and who was Swiss. And
I told them I'm going to go inside first because I have an appointment. My appointment...it
hadn't really been conferred to me that I had an appointment but uh and when I return from the
appointment then we can all talk together. The colonel uh who is head of the gendarmerie,
accompanied me to the minister's office. It was a little office in the basement and this

colonel three days later killed himself by the way. He saw that everything was lost. He'd been
compromised because of the Jewish question and so he killed himself. Sada (ph) was his name.
Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole gendarmerie of Hungary at that time, so I went to
this minister that I had seen, not known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said
yes. He wanted to solve the Jewish question by killing everyone. And so I started to say do you
realize what's happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people
will have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you
know... even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind,
people...anything to move him. I even cried. Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do
anymore. I I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I told him, look...if
within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from me a guarantee that all is
calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian government have
been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had

come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Hungarian government...we had
reached an agreement and received guarantees. Not only that but the Hungarian government
wanted to send a diplomatic representative to Madrid in order to, to tie diplomatic
relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the
Spanish government who didn't wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear
anything about it. The, the uh credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh
this...what credentials are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials
to Madrid. It was for a certain Colonel . I didn't transmit them because if I did the
Spanish government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they
didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish government kept
quiet. They kept quiet. Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me that he saw
in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government which asked the Spanish
government if I was really the charge d'affaires. The Spanish government never answered. The
Spanish ambassador told me that last night. They never...the Spanish government never
responded to these telegrams. I understood naturally, slowly... slowly understood why we had a
preferential treatment with the Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have
diplomatic relations with Spain to contact the Anglo-Americans. We understood it late, but we
understood it. If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already
talking about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we
would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but
uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all. The Spanish ambassador told me not that...not
everyone is intelligent. I wasn't intelligent. The other the other guy also wasn't intelligent so uh
what do you want. So I told him that if within forty-five hours the Spanish government doesn't
get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order the three thousand Hungarian
citizens which are, who are in, in Spain will be interned...actually there were really a hundred
including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish government
will...or ask the Brazilian government and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those
Hungarian citizens who were in Brazil and Paraguay. So this minister said a friendly
government like the Spanish government would do such a thing? What friendly government? If
you are against us, you're the ones who are against us. This is what we want. We want to
protect these Jews. You don't want to do it, so you are coming against our interests and against
our policy and against our interests and our wishes, so how can you say that we are friends.
We're friends if you say, if you do what we want. To sum it up he said, OK. The Spaniards are,
are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no, and I
became uh demanding in that moment. I said no. All...everyone or nobody. All of those in the
international ghetto must remain where they are or all those in the common ghetto must be, must
have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have to survive too because what
would what would happen of the Hungarian people, so I repeated to him again and all the stories
about vendettas, terrible vendettas and uh the Anglo(c)Americans uh who would come to
bombard the city and so forth and so on. And so we agreed that everything would have uh
occurred in that way. When I left the office I found Wallenberg and were still there, and I
explained the situation to them and I said I was able to obtain this and that. When you do inside
I don't know what you can ask of this minister, but please don't uh do anything to undermine this
agreement that we've just come to. Otherwise nothing more...so Wallenberg asked me for
political asylum in the Spanish Legation and I said fine, I'll wait for you. You go to the
Legation. I'll wait for you and I'm going to have to go find something in the neighborhood and

then I'll, I'll meet you there at the Legation. He said no. I will come with my car in the afternoon.
I'll give you the car because I know you need a car, and I'll come. I never saw him again. Never
saw him again. I know that on the 18th he...on the morning of the 18th he was on __ Street. I
know this for sure, and he had left the house at ten in the morning to go I don't know where.
From then on he disappeared. Now since the since historians say that on the 16th he went to
at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there. I say that's not true

because on the morning of the 18th he was in Budapest in the on the _ Street. means
king. I don't know really... saw him maybe a dozen times. I spoke to him specifically during
the meetings with diplomats. I never saw him otherwise. From the beginning of December, all
the diplomats, mutual diplomats, had disappeared. He couldn't find any of them. Wallenberg...
when I saw Wallenberg at city hall in Budapest on the meeting, the day that I met ,uhI'd
seen him, besides that time, I'd seen him on December 22nd at the uh Papal Nuncio (ph) where
he had signed a document uh to protest uh and this was in favor of women and I remember that
he did not sign that document because he couldn't sign it because he was a secretary and Minister
Danielson, his boss, was there. The ambassador. His, his boss wasn't there at that time. Uh that
morning during the meeting I told the Archbishop Angelo I would like to speak privately
with you and so we went into another office and so I told him look...I started speaking to him in
Italian. In the meetings we always spoke in French. Uh I started speaking in Italian. I said look,
I'm not a Spaniard. I'm Italian and I'm close to you because I'm, I was born in Komo (ph) and he
had also been born close to Komo. He said oh, you're...you're kidding. You're joking. I said no,
no. I'm not kidding. This is the truth. I tell you this because if something would ever happen to
me, you...I want you to know this so that you can uh tell my relatives. He told me, I remember,
don't tell : was his secretary because that guy is very picky. He can...he might
become very angry, might cause trouble. I said no, no. I won't tell . And
his...practically this is where the story ends because after a few days...no, actually the next
morning, Mr. =, Mr.__ sent an employee to ask for telegrams to send to Madrid because
we didn't have a radio. The capital was under siege and it wasn't...we couldn't communicate with
Vienna. Normally you could telephone Vienna, Vienna telephoned Berlin, and Berlin via radio
communicated to Madrid. But this...it was no longer possible to use the phone. And so I sent
this employee to ask for a telegram which uh I asked him to send via radio radio because he had
aradio. Uh Mr. Fakash, Attorney Fakash who was an attorney who was very picky, an old-
timer, uh told me that I shouldn't send the telegram and I told him look, if I don't send the
telegram as soon as this employee goes back to Minister , everything will fall apart. If we
send the telegram we'll save four or five days. We'll gain four or five days because the Spanish
government will of course have to reflect on this before responding. They're not going to
respond immediately obviously. The telegram will be send today. I don't know if it'll arrive
immediately in Madrid and who will receive it in Madrid. It has to be sent to Bern and this takes
time. I wrote to Bern. I wrote to the embassy in Bern. After two or three or four days
the...Madrid sent its response thanking uh thanks and it said that it was sure that the Hungarian
government would have respected the agreements and so forth and so on. The employee came to
deliver the telegram himself and he said that the minister was very satisfied with the telegram
and so forth. And then one time something happened which is a little bit funny but at the same
time it uh it's...I don't want to say fear but it gave me, made me a little bit anxious. I went to the
Foreign Affairs Ministry. This was at the end of December. I think before Christmas I went to
the Foreign Affairs Ministry and I entered the antechamber where the secre...permanent secretary
had his office. He was like a Vice Minister with whom I'd had contact. His name was ;

and I saw that there were two men seated on a couch who were waiting and one of them I, I
recognized. He was the Chancellor of the Italian Legation, the Royal Italian Legation, and the
other gentleman I didn't know who he was, so I very boldly...I had to very boldly salute them
like this and instead of going to the secretary who sort of looked at me with surprise, I went to to
the door. I pretended to knock. I went inside and to see this Vice Minister. I did what I had to
do and after four...after fifteen minutes or so I left. I said goodbye to the young lady and I made
a, a vague signal with my hand like this and I left. But once I arrived in the in the hallway I
really came back and I started to eaves...eavesdrop and I heard that these two people entered the
office and entered the Vice Minister's office so I entered the area too, and I asked Mrs...the
young lady...and I said, oh I think I recognize these two men and she said the big man is Minister
Gratanzi (ph) of the Social Republic of Italy and the other is his secretary. He was the he was a
fascist minister, the Social Republic...the Fascist Social Republic. On the 16th...in the meantime
between the...on the 13th it wasn't possible to leave the Legation anymore. We still had
telephone communications with which I could control or check on the various houses, not
directly because there were no phones in the houses but there were Christians who lived uh in
front of the houses or next to them, the houses, and they had agreed to telephone to us if there
was danger and for example with Eva Long (ph) on the evening of January 3rd or 4th or Sth or
whatever it was. I think she told me even...I think she even told me...anyway they, they
remember more than I do. She called me and I went over there at three in the morning.
Anyhow... There wasn't...no...it wasn't just that time. That happened many times, ten or fifteen
times. Almost every evening I had to get up and go because the Nazis wanted to come and take
them away, to take the Jews away from the houses. ...speaking. I told them that we had
agreements with the
Hungarian government and so forth and so on and in the meantime somebody well from my
entourage...I always had an entourage. I always had four police officers and two employees of
the security office and in reality I always traveled with two people but...two policemen and two
public security people, and they never wanted to leave my side and when I left there were two
policemen who left and the Legation too...I...I felt like I was a medieval cavalier with the flag
and the banner whenever I traveled with them. But anyway this normally happened at night and
I would go on foot because it was dangerous to go by car at night. There weren't very many
lights. But anyhow that night, that last night that I went to Eva Long in let's say Eva Long's
house...I didn't know Eva Long at the time. I met her only three years ago. L...I arrived five
minutes after a man had thrown himself out of the window from the fifth floor and you asked me
how I, how could I prevent them from taking them away and I would tell them that we had
agreements and then at the same time one of my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone
the police commando and the Colonel would intervene. This is someone who had helped
me, because I had contacts with everyone, with Nazis, non-Nazis. It doesn't matter that he was a
Nazi who...he was a Nazi but he was useful so I had contacts with him and there was a
Hungarian Nazi, a young guy with a beard. If] asked him for something, he would do it for me.
You understand. Now I had contacts with him. I had contacts with everyone. Whoever
happened to be there, I had contacts with because that's how you had to operate. Experience
taught me that everyone can be useful. There's some who do big favors and some who do
smaller favors. Some could intervene for this and some could intervene for that reason. The
Foreign Affairs Minister could intervene for that and the Interior Minister could intervene for
this and the Nazi Party for another reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on
the street where the Legation was...at the very end of the street...the street was three hundred

meters long, there was a Russian tank with the mouth of the cannon facing the street which
would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dared to leave and go on the street. In order to
cross the street from the Legation to the ___ Paraguayan Legation which was...you had to open
the door and dash, make a dash to get to the other side. And as soon as you did the, the tank
would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was in telephone contact with the houses because as
I said there were always Christian friends who had telephones in nearing the houses who were
called. They saw something abnormal. For example, that night they called...I don't know who
they called. After half an hour I arrived and I saw that they were about to take them away. I
stopped everything but unfortunately I arrived five minutes after a man threw himself out of a
window on the fifth floor. I thought it was a woman, but Eva Long told me that it was a man.
When J arrived they had already covered the body. The police had covered the body. And I
thought it was a woman but in...it was aman. And so on the 16th uh you arrived in my area, on
my street and until the afternoon, in the afternoon, up until the afternoon they had respected
extra-territory . We took the flag down. We put the Swedish flag up. We took the
emblem, the Spanish emblem down and put the Swedish emblem because Sweden was supposed
to protect Spain's interests. No...because that's the way it's done. When one nation cannot have
relations with another nation, another nation which can have relations, it can intervene to protect
the interests and in fact I think that Sweden was able to...after ten or twelve days of the Russian's
arrival, to...was able to empty the building, the Spanish building. Of that I'm not really sure
because I was in hiding. I couldn't do anything more. As I was telling you about Wallenberg, on
the morning of the 18th, the Russians took me and they put me to sweep the streets.
Street...I had to sweep Street. At a certain point I saw in front of a building a man whose
name was who, who had been my chauffeur and who had been wounded driving my car.
I wasn't there at the time. Uh my...in my position where I was seated uh there was a policeman
who was killed. He...and then the car was taken away and then the car was found again a few
hours later but it was destroyed. This man has been my chauffeur to do me a favor and at the
same time had, he had also, he had had ties with the International Red Cross because the delegate
of the International Red Cross never showed his face. The human miseries. So I asked him, did
you see Wallenberg. He said yes. He's here. Please, go, go fetch him. I can't move because
there's this guy here with a machine gun, the GBU guy who, who is forcing me to sweep the
street. After fifteen minutes or ten minutes though he came back. He say no, he's gone. He left
a few minutes ago, and this is about eleven in the morning, but from then on nothing more was
heard about Wallenberg, so I, therefore I think that he died or because he was hit by a sniper or
because he was hit by a German grenade. Uh they resisted until the mid(c)February in the castle
of Buda (ph), in the hills of Buda, I think, or perhaps he met a group of Nazis, Hungarians,
Nazis, who recognized him and who killed him on the spot. There were hundreds and hundreds
of bodies buried in the snow in the area of the Spanish Legation, Mussolini Square. I think that
he wanted to cross Street to go to the international ghetto, I think. Or anyhow
such...this...a similar declaration was...I made a similar declaration in 1962 I think after a request
that was made to me by the Swedish Consulate in Milan. Last year Danielson's widow invited
me to her house in the province of Trento (ph). I was at and when we talked about this
issue, she told me that her husband and the Foreign Affairs Minister never believed that
Wallenberg was taken to the Soviet Union, Russia. Anyhow, some people were interested in
blowing up the issue in good faith but then others kept saying things that were not true. As far as
I was concerned that's what happened. I may be wrong but that's how it was for me. That's what
I believe. I remained three or four months until April, May...five months in Budapest and then

the Russians uh kicked every...all the foreign citizens out. I was trying to get back home but they
could have sent us Italians home with the trains and in ten or twelve hours we would have been
to Capezio (ph) or to or to the other place, what's it called... . Instead they sent us via
Bucha , Istanbul and it took ten days of travel in latched up cars and with a hunger that I
don't want to speak about because we didn't even have any money. There was nothing left. I
didn't have anything. I had only... everything...I had only what I was wearing the day that the
Russians arrived. Everything had been burnt at the Legation. No...yes...at the villa of the
Spanish Legation in Budapest, at Buda, and everything else was stolen by the Russians. I didn't
even have a shaver to shave. In those days they had...I had a Gillette shaver. Uh we...when we
arrived...when I arrived in Istanbul, I found the...someone who had the suitcase that once...a
suitcase that once had belonged to me and which had also my shaving kit and I said to him I need
my shaving kit. Luckily this person had an extra shaving kit.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
...When I returned to Italy I found that my company had fired me and, and it was an ugly period
and I had to even pay for the car that I had borrowed from an Italian and the car was then burnt
and I had to pay for that car with my money, but anyway it was a bad period, but anyway I
managed. It's difficult when you're forty to change jobs and in a bad situation as it was in Italy at
the time, the War of the Mosques (ph) and so forth. It's hard to adapt and I once again went to
start afresh and to find work. I, I adapted. Uh I had to...in order to put bread on the table, and
sometimes I wasn't able to do that perfectly but after ten years I was successful. My son was
born and we'll _ for all the sacrifices. I was able to raise him and to settle, settle him and
now I consider that I'm uh I'm all settled. I can't say that I am uh I'm rich, but I live, live. I live
and I'm happy this way. Especially because all of those people who had been helped by me uh
looked for me and they celebrated me. They made me come to Washington. You're welcomed.
If in the future, if you need any explanations on anything, we can correspond, but you must write
in Italian. . I don't know what happened. There's a lady here, Magadelena
(ph), who knew him well. She asked me the same thing. What happened? And I say at the end
of November, I believe, before Sanspritz left, he disappeared. Since he was trying to get to home
in Spain, perhaps he was able with the passport that he had, perhaps he was able to go to Spain.
It was difficult because he was a deserter of the Blue Division of Spain which was fighting with
the Germans. He had fought in these Divisions next to, with the Germans. I don't...I can't...I've
tried to find out because he was a very nice guy. He was young. He was probably twenty-two,
maybe twenty-three. He was a very nice guy. He was very helpful. He, he gave me a hand
in...several times for something. I remember that he came with, he accompanied me. But at the
end of November he disappeared and that day we didn't see him again. Yes...Italian. There are
some people who helped me morally, who lives in Germany now and morally...gave me moral
support. And then there was Attorney Fakash who unfortunately died the day that the Russians
entered the city. That was so unlucky for him. He had a beautiful daughter who was ten years
old. He was married. He was Jewish, but I think that he converted because he married a
princess, from Vienna. Not a royal princess. She had the title of a princess but it
wasn't a royal title. I don't know exactly what...Mrs. . No, why. I told you that she
helped me morally. Thanks to you. Ifin the future you need some explanations, I'd love to send,
I'd love to send. You can correspond with me in Italy, but please write in Italian so that I don't
need to have it translated and so forth. Let me guess. There were, there are many other things
that I could tell. I keep saying that the day...I keep saying that the work did not involve just
writing those letters of protection. Once those letters were written, the work to protect these
people just got started because they had to be protected day and night. When I slept...Italian...
