A: My father did go to temple, and prayed every morning and did go to temple on
Saturdays. Of course, kept kosher. And I wasn’t really aware of that much more of
what religious meant; I thought all Jews were religious.
Q: So you celebrated the holidays, and — and —
A: Yes, oh, definitely, this was part of —
Q: — and Shabbat, and —
A: — Shabbat, yeah, that was a-all part of life and I felt that that’s the way it has to
be.
Q: So, how old were you when you s — did you start school where you —
A: [never started s —
Q: You never did.
A: —I never went to school until after we were liberated. So basically, at that point I
was almost nine years old before I went to school, without knowing how to read or
write.
Q: So, when the war started, you — you were on the Soviet side, or you were on the
Polish side?
A: We were on the Polish side, and then the — the Soviets came in in —I guess in
1940, maybe, I think.
Q: Right.
A: And tha — and of course, and then the Germans came in. The Soviets, we were a
little bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be taken to — my father was afraid that they’d

take him to Russia, whatever. And we thought that maybe ca — jer — he thought that
maybe ki— when the Germans came in, they didn’t — they weren't going to harm
Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in Germany. But of course we
discovered very quickly otherwise. And after awhile, which I don’t really remember
how long, they formed a ghetto in my hometown, and everybody from all the
villages and different neighborhoods — our house was in the ghetto. And many
people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. Cause I remember
people basically dying, I don’t know how long it took after the ghetto was forming,
but on our doorstep there would be dead people that have — from hunger, you know.
And they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels. And we
basically, since we were in our hometown, I imagine my — my parents may have
stored some food, so I don’t remember being hungry at that point. Maybe I was too
young to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti — akejas they call
it, you know. The first one we — we had relatives outside of town, they — we went
there, to outside of town. My father, I think, remained in town, but my grandfather,
when we came back, we discovered my father’s father was killed, right across the
street. He was shot right across the street from our house. And then the second one,
we went into hiding someplace outside of the city. But the third one, my father
brought us to a Christian family, and he — they said that all workers should come
and register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register.
And after a day or two, he will come and get us. And it took about a week and he

never came back. So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking
out — out of the — their — wherever they hid us, in their barn. And they were shotti —
shooting after us, you know, when we — they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I
guess. And we went back to our home, but eventually this akeja must have stopped,
or whatever, but they came into our house and they chased us out. Out of the house.
And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab — she had a — her
girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it — to take that. As a child I was able
to sneak by with that. And this is basically — that eventually saved our life. And then
they made Judenfrei, our town was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father’s
side had survived, and then an aunt, my father’s sister. And we went into the woods,
and we — I guess my mother must have known that across this river, was called the
Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. And you — you were able to
get there. So we were in the woods right acro — from the river, and hiding in there,
and a young student came across. He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he
says, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will
come and — and take you across. He carried me across, because I was the youngest
one. My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across
with packages, if they had — whatever they had. And we came to a little town,
Potok Zloty, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made
Judenfrei over there. And we went on to Buczacz, and in Buczacz we lived with a
family that was in the ghetto, there was a ghetto there. And there were also many

akejas and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching.
And I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children. And
right after the akeja I’d come out and they’d say, the children are dead, they’re —
they’re gone. Or — and one day I came out and I saw a wagon full of dead children,
with bleed — blood coming out of the — the wagon. You know, when — so I was
always ready, I was afraid I’d be left behind, being the — the youngest one. So as
soon as they — I’d be — at night or whatever, I’d be the first one to get dressed and
hold onto my mother to go into hiding. And basically after this — you know, after —
I’m—T’m not sure of how much time passed, they made that town Judenfrei, and
my — and we had an-another little town, my ki — father’s relatives, cousins were
there, and they — I don’t how they communicated with my mother, but she decided
to go there. And we went to Kopyezynce was that name. And we went in — we
stayed with them. And of course then it started over there; the — the killings started
over there. And my f- relatives’ son, they — he was 17 or 18 years old, with other
boys they built a bunker from that house that we lived in to under the street, and we
felt it was very safe, you know, in the basement it was camouflaged, in the
basement, and we were there. There were a couple of akejas there, but this was like
the last one. We we — all went into this bunker, we were 30 some odd people that
went in there. And they must — they built a air— you know, some type of air, to give
us air in the street. And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we — that
there was a — that we — there was a bunker under there, so they started digging from

the other side the street and came in that side. And then they realized that there had
to be an opening in a — in the house, you know, that we — how we got in there. So
they discovered us on both sides. They pulled everybody out, and they started
throwing hand grenades into the bunker. And basically, I don’t know what
happened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the bunker,
whatever. A — but I was holding onto my brother. And people died, and the dead
bodies fell on top of us. And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you
know, the dead, to see what was there. And they hit my brother over the head with
an axe, you know, to tr — they thought that he was still alive. But I was covered with
bodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe. And basically, I
survived with that one shoe on, through the war. And then we — we — when — after
we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or
whatever, they were all dead people. At night we snuck out of there, went into a —
into another building, out onto a roof. We stayed there for a long time without any
food. Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my — my throat was
closing up from not eating or drinking. But there was like a — a —a rusty tub, or
whatever with the — with the water was leaking from the roof. And she found a
straw and made me drink the water with a st — through a straw, because it was
feathers and dirt in that water. And then we were discovered there. But if— they
only robbed us. There were some other people from the bunker that survived,
another three men, | think wi-with us. And — you know, and they let us — they —

they told us, this is the end, they’re gonna — going to keep killing until all the Jews
are gone, he says. But there is a labor camp outside of — of — that some Jews are
working on the labor — in the labor camp outside of town. To us, of course, it was a
strange town, we weren’t there very long. It was a ghetto — walled ghetto. But we —
these two men that were with us on that roof came down with us and looked for a
place to go over the wall. And they found like an old couch or a chair, I don’t know
what it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over. They threw me
over the — th — over the fence, and we started running away from the ghetto. And it
was — a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the — the gate, the Jews
were escaping, and they start — they shot after us. Well, we were able to get to —I
think one of the man got — you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the
fields, and there was — the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of
days in — my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that labor camp
where Jews were still working. We got there and we — we s — we got there at night
and there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night. They were always afraid
that at night they’d come and get them. We were in a building that wasn’t quite
finished yet. They came to rob us again, and they — my mother had — at this point
she had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and
they touched her boot that it was there. So they hit her to get off the boot and she
refused. She said, we’ll scream. They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren’t
allowed to rob. So they got scared and ran away. And then morning came, and my

mother went into the camp, into that labor camp and ta — find out if she could work
there. And the man that was in charge of labor — my mother happened to have been
a beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the floor in her — in his
office. And he started talking to her, and he said, you know, you could pass as a
Polish woman. So she says, but I have two children. So he said, two children, he
says, do you have a — so she says, I have a son and a daughter. Says well, no son, I
cannot help you with a son, but with a daughter. But a couple of days later he said
to her, I—if you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a
friend that would be willing to hide you outside into — in a — outside in another
farm. And my mother said she didn’t — she was afraid to say that she had the money
with her. But she said, I have money in the ghetto, and I will sneak back in the
ghetto and dig it out. She wanted to make sure that he meant it. And sure enough, he
did have a friend, he sends a worker from that other farm to pick us up, you know,
to — to take us — he wanted gold dollars, he didn’t want — so we were very lucky to
have gold and not paper money. And they took us to this other f— to this other farm,
or to — you know what — what it was, it was — was a lot of people working for him,
he was like the boss. And they put us in the room, they — it was an empty building.
And there was a man that was assigned to bring us food or take out our waste, or
whatever. And he — the man didn’t tell us that he was Jewish passing himself off as
a —he was the bookkeeper on that farm. But he was a Jew, and he passed himself
off as a — you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he

could. I mean, mostly it was potatoes. And being the youngest one after we were
there for eight months, and then they started — rumors were he ki — brought back
rumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the
war, and they were coming closer. And the partisans were in the woods, we were
hoping we’d get liberated. But eventually, of course, the — the war came closer, and
I think that they — that somebody must have discovered that there may be Jews in
there. So they moved us to a still. But the — and the still in — these big barrels in a
still, and — and then we went up to the — the roof, I don’t — and they were going to
bomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that buildings
because they didn’t want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there.
And we heard them talking outside, you know, that this is next, they were going to
[indecipherable]. And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away.
And we didn’t really know if we were — if the Russians were coming, if the rai — so
we stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they — they
couldn’t bring it to us over there. Eventually they came and they told us you’re
liberated, you’re free. And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet
were swollen. And we got outside and we hitched a ride with the Russian soldiers as
they were advancing to the next town. And — and that town they were — some Jews
started coming out of — you know, there were a couple of families came out of
hiding, and we stayed there. So basically, that was our liberation. And then we
started running because the war was going on right near us. We tried to go closer to

the Russian border. And other people were coming out of labor camps, and they had
typhus, and my mother and I both got typhus. And we — that part is completely like
way — vague in my mind. I know that I couldn’t walk, that I lost my hair. But I, you
know — and eventually, as it quieted down, we worked ourselves back to our
hometown, hoping that there would somebody be left, somebody would be — you
know, we didn’t know what — the fate of my father, we just —
Q: Right.
A: — knew that he didn’t come back, and my mother’s sisters, grandmothers,
everybody. You know, so we came back to town and some Jews finally unfil — you
know, came back. Some of the Jews that — we stayed there for awhile, and that’s
when the first — when it got a little bit — they wanted the children to go to school —
Q: Right.
A: — so that was my first experience to go to school. And it was a Polish school at
that point —
Q: Right.
A: — but it was the Russians — within weeks they changed it to Russian school. And
then we ha — we — since we were Polish citizens, we — we were able to get — go to
Poland, since this became Russia.
Q: Mm-hm, right.
A: And they got us onto trains, you know, we got into a train, you know, all the
Jews, and we were — went to Poland. And in Poland we were in Bytom, in a town

Bytom. And without having schooling, and I was — guess there was no food, my
mother put us in an orphanage in — in Poland. I forgot the name of the town. But
next — ex — actually, the next [indecipherable] there wasn’t much food in that
orphanage. The next town, and the next, it— we went to an orphanage in Zabrze,
and the — and stayed there, but th-the funny part is, when I went to Houston, I —
some people came and they were searching for people, they fa — had — had a picture
of — when they didn’t remember of why they were there —
Q: Right.
A: — of what they were there, and I was in the picture with them. So actu — there’s
one woman here, Ida from Chicago, who we found each other in Houston through
one of these meetings.
Q: Oh wow.
A: And there was another man, George Hoffman, he’s not here today, we were in
that orphanage. And eventually we left, of course, for Germany. And I was in the
DP camp in Bad Reichenhall in Germany. Went to a school as — there was Zionist
organizations formed, I was really hoping as a— as a young child to go to Israel,
you know, I wanted to be — to be a soldier or whatever. But my mother put is in the
— in the orphanage Preen(ph), which many children it was like a transit thing to go
to the United States. So as the — of the orphans quota we — I came in 1949, I came
to the United States, and was sent to Minneapolis as a foster child. And I lived
with a Jewish family until my mother came to the United States.

Q: And was your brother with you, or —
A: My brother was with — with me all this time.
Q: So you two were together the whole time.
A: He was — together, thi— that time, yeah —
Q: Yeah.
A: — we were all together at that point, just my brother and I.
Q: Right.
A: There are a lot of people here that have been to Preen(ph) yeah, which was —
yes.
Q: Right. Did you ever find out what happened to your father?
A: Eventually, yes, a man in our hometown who survived, he was with my father in
th — in that camp where they gathered them all when they discovered that it wasn’t
really a work thing —
Q: Right.
A: — that they were to register, but they were going to take them to concentration
camp. My father was 41 years old, a strong man, so he s — looked out the window
and he saw two policemen, Ukrainian policemen that he went to school with. So he
spoke to one of them and he said, I have two watches with me, Ill gladly give you
my watches, and I’m gonna jump out the window. He didn't do it, but he pointed
him out to the next man, and as he was running out the window he was shot.
Q: Did any of your other family survive?

A: Basically, you know, my mother was one of seven sisters. I-I have one cousin.
We were — on my mother’s side, we were 19 cousins. Wa — one cousin survived, he
s —he lives in Florida now, too. And now my mother has died, my f— brother has
died, and I—I have my children, that’s it.
Q: Mm-hm. I want to go back a little bit.
A: Yes.
Q: I guess this would probably be pre-war. What was the first thing you really —
what’s the first memory you have as a child?
A: Basically going visiting — to visit relatives. In the summertime going out to the
country, and you know, all wonderful, wonderful memories, you know.
Q: Yeah. And when the war started, I guess I’m wondering —
A: I went also to pre-school at one point, and it was a Hebrew — it was a Hebrew, I
guess, a Hebrew pre-school, and I was — the thing I remember is they taught us on
the blackboard, you know, they made like — and they said sus(ph), so they made a —
a — you make a —a-— you make a circle, you make a — a straight, you know, a—a
line, and a little dot, and another circle. And that’s sus(ph) and that means horse,

Q: That’s great. Do you remember your mother — I-I guess I’m just — you were such
a young child, what — I mean, that was only, really the only life you really knew for
a long time.
A: Yes.
Q: Do you remember your mother just being — she sounds like a very strong
woman. Do you remember her just being terrified all the time? How were you — she
was always looking out for you and your brother.
A: Always looking out for — for us and —
Q: Right.
A: — you know, fo —
Q: Did you get the impression that she was scared?
A: [indecipherable] we were all scared —
Q: Yeah.
A: — we were all scared, so I’m really not sure where the fear came out of, but the
fear was constant, you know, that’s constant, of being discovered, of being you
know, seen, of being left behind, of being killed, you know.
Q: Right.
A: In fact we — in that Buezacz, in the town where I had seen these dead children on
the wagon —

A: — there were some relatives of ours that were there too, and they had a baby. You
know, they had — had a baby. And right after one of these akejas my mother sent
me and my brother there, to see if they’ve survived, and when we came in there,
their baby was in the crib, de-dead in the crib, shot in the crib. You know, so that’s
constantly fearing that I was youngest one, that maybe, you know — you also heard
that parents ran away, left their young children. They wouldn’t let them into a
bunker, because you may cry. In Buezacz we were in bunker, there was a baby that
cried at us, we — they were searching and we heard them. The mother put a pillow
over him, and he died. It was a baby of — six weeks old baby. Was — was — you
know, choked right there in that bunker. You know, so it was always that fear of,
you know, of that.
Q: Was that the — I mean, was the biggest fear losing your family, or —
A: I don’t — you know, this is so very strange that I don’t have — I was just speaking
to a friend of mine who’s also — who is my age. She interviewed yesterday and she
said, I don’t remember, did I miss my mother, father, my sisters? She says, how did
I feel? I feel the same way, did I really? All I remember is years later, you know, if I
was angry at my mother I was — always felt my father’s gonna come, he’s gonna
come back. You know, an-and for many years actually, I was already an adult, I—
knowing already that he had been killed, I always thought maybe it was wrong, he’s
gonna come back.
Q: So you came to the United States and you lived with a foster family.

A: Fa-Fa-Family in Minneapolis.
Q: And how was — I mean, did they —
A: They did it mostly for money, it wasn’t, you know —
Q: Right.
A: — they — I don’t know if they were in great need, or whatever, but they took —we
were not the first set of foster children that they had taken in from this — I — I think
it was the group, the Joint or the HIAS, or whoever, sent us there. When we got to
New York, actually, they asked us if we had any family in the United States, if we
wanted to stay; we had nobody.
Q: Right.
A: So I - and it was very, very hot. I came from Germany in a wool outfit with
wool socks, and it was like 98 degrees and humid, I had never experienced humidity
before. And I said, just send us away, as far away from New York as possible. So
they sent us to Minneapolis.
Q: Did you — what language are you speaking at that point? Were you only
speaking —

A: Yeah.
Q: So when you got —
A: And no English —
Q: No English.
A: —no English at all. And I remember going with my foster mother to the
supermarket. As a child I must have been learning very quickly. And a man
approached and asked me something, and I understood, and she was so excited that
I understood what he asked me.
Q: So, what language were you speaking with your — with your foster family?
A: Yiddish —
Q: Yiddish.
A: — probably Yiddish, yes. I think Yiddish.
Q: Yeah.
A: [have this friend of mine here and I said, you know, who — I know her from the
DP camp. And I said, what language did we speak? She says, Russian. I says, I di—
never spoke Russian, so you couldn’t have been speaking to me in Russian. So we

A: — of course they made — advanced pretty quickly. They put me in — in
Minneapol - of course, I went to — in the DP camp, I went to school in DP camp.
And that was a — really an accelerated course. So when I got to Minneapolis, I
think it was sixth or seventh grade that they put me in immediately. I’m not sure of
how well I did, but I was there. But coming back then later, when my mother
arrived and we came back to New York, I went into ninth grade in junior high
school.
Q: Right.
A: And there was a Jewish teacher and he must have been very — and I remember
writing for Thanksgiving, it was my first Thanksgiving in the u— you know, maybe
second Thanksgiving —
Q: Right.
A: —in the United States. And I wrote my story in my broken English or whatever,
but he praised me so much, it gave me so much courage. He thought that I did so
well, you know, of what I was thankful for.

A: — or they put me in the — and this was in the Bronx, there was a — everybody was
taking Spanish at that point. I had never heard Spanish before, but they handed me a
book. And of course, reading was very easy because it’s the same as you would
Polish. You know, I read — the teacher didn’t discover that I didn’t know any
Spanish, probably for weeks. She just thought I was very — I read very well, better
than the American children, because I — it’s the way you — phonetically.
Q: Right.
A: It was so easy for me.
Q: So you — so you went to school. Did you go — did you want to?
A: And then I went on — then I went on to, you know, into high school, in Taft High
School in the Bronx. But I got married, of course, very young. I was 17 years old
when I got married.
Q: Wow. And how did you meet your husband?
A: I needed a dental for — for school. They wouldn’t give me — they wouldn’t — you
had to go — you know, you wouldn’t get a grade in gym, unless you got a dental. So
I went — my mother took me along to a dentist, and he spoke Yiddish, and that’s
why my mother, of course, chose him.
Q: Right.
A: And he was a young man, and he said, if— ll only give you a dental if you’ ll
meet my cousin. And this was his cousin, and eventually I married him.

Q: Wow. You hear a lot of stories like that, it’s — it’s so neat, and how everybody
was matchmaking through — throughout New York. Did you — did you eventually
grow to like New York?
A: I never really got to liking New York. I mean, of course I di— eventually, we
lived in the Bronx and I had children and everything. But I was very happy when I
— when we moved away. We moved away to — first to Rutland county, and
eventually we, for many years we lived in Poughkeepsie, New York. I was very
happy outside of — I also didn’t mingle that much with — because there weren’t that
many survivors, you know, my husband was American, so I didn’t mingle that
much with, you know — but I was happy, I blended — I thought I blended in, I— In—
I never admit it. If they didn’t ask me, I never said I was a survivor unless they
asked me.
Q: Right. And so you don’t really remember di—
A: What —
Q: You know, that’s always — always one — something I — I wonder about is, how
did you explain it to people when they did ask, who didn’t know about it,
necessarily?
A: People knew, but I — I basically never told my children never told my husband.
This is — today is the first time that I’m ready to speak about it. I— when they called
me from Spielberg, when they would come to town, three times I cancelled my
appointment. I never —I still don’t feel very comfortable, and my children know it.

They’ve never asked, because they felt it was painful for me. But now I have one of
— little grandson, who — he lives in Houston. He — I think his parents came back of
seeing a movie about the Holocaust, and th — we discussed it, and he realized that it
was me. So since then he’s been prodding me, when can you tell me the story? I
always tell him, not today, hi— I’m not — not today, some other time. And every
time I come to town, or he comes, he says, I — is — is this the time yet? And I always
say not yet —
Q: Right.
A: — it’s not — the time is not yet. In fact, I remember going to a Seder one time, and
one of the young — the — asked me, knowing that I was a survivor, asked me some
questions, and I — and I told him a couple of things that had happened to me, and
my husband sat there and he was amazed that he had never — after many years being
married, he had never heard this from me. And he also never questioned me of what
I went through. My mother did a little talking, you know —
Q: Yeah.
A: —and she spoke to my children too, but I —
Q: When you ra — and did your brother talk about it? Did you and your brother talk
about it?
A: My brother — my bro — no, we never spoke about it. The two of us to — to — to
each other, we never spoke about it. But I think my brother was a little bit more
affected by it, whatever. He was a little depressed, he was — he got married, he had

a family, but he definitely had a lot of the syndromes that I see in survivors. He was
—he was four years older than I was.
Q: Right.
A: He was definitely, I felt, more affected by it. In fact, I don’t even like when
people, you know, whatever is wrong with me, when people thi — say, you know,
oh, it must be due to the Holocaust, I don’t like to —
Q: Yeah.
A: — blame this on the Holocaust.
Q: And you never experienced any kind of like nightmares or anything like that

A: Oh yes, yes, yes, they — to this day I get, you know, and I’m amazed that after
many years, you know, I find myself running, or you know, or — or shooting, yes, I
—Ido. The nightmares have never really stopped.
Q: Yeah. I— I want to go back a little bit to moving from town to town. You were —
you said you were ready at any moment to go.
A: To go or to hide or whatever, yes.
Q: To hide, to hide. It — if it— do you remember at any point just getting tired of —
of moving, or wanting, liking a particular place where you were?
A: Oh, yes, yes, every time, every time we would get settled as a child, you know, if
