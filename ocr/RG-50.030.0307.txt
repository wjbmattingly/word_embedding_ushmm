WILLIAM LOEW
March 9, 1995
Q: Can you tell us your name and where you were born?
A: My name is and they used to call us Willy or Wilek. Loew was L-O-
W, but when I came to the United States it was changed to L-O-E-W. So the name
actually here in the United States is William Loew, but my friends back at home they
remember me as Wilek. I was born in Lwow, Lemberg. Lemberg is basically a German
name for Louve and my parents came from probably Austria. I'm not quite sure, but from
Austria and we settled down in Lwow. That was Galicia at the time and also known as a
Austria Hungarian empire. The time in the when I was born I had
basically a nice family, a wonderful family. Let me speak about my brothers. I had an
older brother we used to call Eli. The oldest one was Abe. We had a very close family.
My mother was very -- was a housewife but also dealing in business. Our business was
we had a brewery a mead brewery which is a honey wine. The business was quite
prosperous. For one thing, our business has been derived from previous generations. We
started, but not my father but my grandfather and my uncles they started in 1870. As a
matter of fact I still have one of the labels of our original wines which is a honey wine.
Our family was approximately 80 persons strong counting my uncles, my grandfathers
from either side, my mother's and my father's side. We were more numerous on my
father's side than on my mother's side. My mother's maiden name was Margulies and
some of her brothers went to Palestine. At that time in 1932, 1933 and the remainder
stayed there in at that time. We stayed and we tried to continue our
business. My father died when I was four years old. He died probably 1929 so my mother
actually took over the business. I don't think she was a good business woman from what I
recall. The business continued. We had my oldest brother could not get into a university
in because there was a quota for the Jewish students, so he had to move
out from Louve to Warsaw. So, he studied there. This was expensive to study in Warsaw
because the money that we had from the business was not that prosperous. I'm not quite
sure the reason for it but I think that my mother wasn't as aggressive in the business as
she should be. So, if I recall sometime in 1934 to 1934 before we folded our business and
we were no longer in the business of honey wine. But my uncles they continued to be in
business. At that time in that previous years, we used to export our wine to different areas
of Poland that we know and also to other countries. The Jewish life in Louve was the best
that can be said back in '37 '38 from what I can recall was lukewarm. It wasn't very bad.
It wasn't very good. We did have our quotas going to school as a matter of fact when I
went for my exam to enter the gymnasium even though the gymnasium was ten blocks
away from me, I couldn't get in because I had a quota. I passed I understand my entry
exam, but I couldn't get in. That was back in 1938. So, in order to continue my studies I
had to move on somewhere else and I had to go to another gymnasium back on Louve on
Street. It was known as the Jewish gymnasium. Going back to '38, '38
was a fairly peaceful years for our family but it was a hardship because we couldn't meet
the loans that my father apparently incurred. So, things were difficult. My oldest brother
Abe who was in Warsaw, he finished his master's degree and he came back home and he

tried to stabilize, because he was basically the oldest in our family, he tried to stabilize
the family. Eli who was two years older than I was, he was more enterprising but for his
own good. He was not part of -- he would try to help stabilize the family but we used to
love each other and we used to fight each other and we used to do things that 13, 14 year
old boys used to do. Abe on the other hand was much older that we were. He was older
than I by ten years so he was more a serious person and he had very little in common
with us other than try to take over the father figure, which he didn't succeed in many
ways. In 1938, in 1939 things were getting worse in terms of what I recall there were
quite a few refugees who would be coming from the western part of Poland especially
those Jews who were exiled from Germany who came from Poland and somehow they
didn't stay long enough in the western part of Poland and they kept on moving and settled
down in our place in Louve. This was in '39 and it wasn't really that bad yet, yet they
came the German Jews in thousands and settled down in Poland.

Q: What year were you born?

A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925.

Q: Did you work in the winery?

A: No, I did not. We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our
enterprise, or the winery, wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't
work. The only time I went to the cellar or to the winery is to see the process of making
wine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists
in the winemakers. They were there, of course, I recall we had a winery that took space a
whole block because that whole block used to belong to us. Underneath in the cellar
under the whole block was the whole winery. I recall that barrels where the wine was
stored for aging was stacked four or five barrels stacked high. They were smaller. They
were not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the United States but I
recall they were maybe 35 gallons. This was the standard barrel at that time to age honey
wine. I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma
contributed from the honey it was still there. But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and
I don't know who took over our business. It could have been that my uncles had took it
over.

Q: You lost your father when you were four years old?

A: Right.

Q: Do you remember him?

A: Very little. There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old.
He had a beautiful flag, eight or nine rooms and each room was designated for a certain
purpose. Beside the bedroom and the dining room we had what we used to call salon
which is a large area and we had a special reception place for certain events or for our
friends of the family. So, we had a fairly large flag. My grandfather who actually brought

me up because I lost my father when I was four, he used to live with us and my aunt
Miriam she was a sister of my mother and we stayed together. That was my family, the
immediate family. Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my
aunt Miriam and my grandfather. My grandfather brought me up. He was in a way a
philosopher on his own. He was a self taught mathematician. He was a true philosopher.
Not only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own
mind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights. He would get up in the morning
four o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the synagogue. I
knew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing. Whenever he woke up he
would start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any
coughing any more. So, he did traditional things with him. He would get up and go to our
synagogue. We used to call it a . He would stay there until from four to
seven, seven thirty and by that time he would come home and wake us up and go and
prepare ourselves to go to school. My grandfather, he was very helpful. He actually
prepared me for my bar mitzvah. He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of
course other languages like Polish and Ukrainian. But his special language was Hebrew
and German. By profession he was a printer. He came from which is
south of Louve. He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in
Romania. I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister,
but I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from
Romania, came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's
side that they live in Romania. He had a good life what I recalled even though it was
difficult from a national point of view, but it was close. We were one family. We had a
good rapport and a good relationship with our uncles. The other brewery in
that was right across our street so we had a major industrial park if you will of breweries.
It was the Isaac Brewery and there was the Brewery and then there was a
Brewery and we were all together in it. It was good. I recall the way we
were distributing our wine to different stores. We had a wagon and horses and we would
be delivering wine so often. I used to like to go to the barn and every so often just to be
together with the horses. So, the whole where we used to live, we used to
live on which is a normal whole block that compares with any block
in the United States, it was all one brewery. We were sort of like a corner house which
was a three story corner house that borders on and ‘
That was the main road in the Louve that carried on for a number of miles. The
is sort of almost like a district, an area where Jews used to live. It was a
dominant area for Jewish life. It had many synagogues. In all, the Jewish people used to
congregate right there. I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but
there are basically, it was the majority in . The minority in that area
were mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles. There were more Ukrainians in our
area than there were Poles. This is not to say that this was typical for -In
our area it was typical. The main activity in was on Friday where all the
peasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly. We had a
farmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly
Fridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce. The potatoes for winter time.
The cabbages, all that stuff because was the main outlet for those
farmers. Of course, we were doing also business at the same time. They were also

purchasing wine. It wasn't a trade off. It was just a matter you would be buying for a
certain period of time. My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but
for the groceries she would go to a special store where it would specialize in Jewish food.
It was a vibrant area for Jews to live. It was very interesting and when the market the
farmer's market was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would
see everything was depleted. The whole area was quiet because Friday night we would be
going to synagogue, so the area was depleted. Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was
still kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping. So the
whole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much
quieter. Although the Jewish life continued. When the life in those days and I'm saying
'38 and '39 was quite active it was also troublesome. Because we wouldn't be completely
free of any problems. Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our
lives. The rumors were obviously of what happened in Germany and what happened in
some other countries like in Romania or Russia although we knew very little of Russia
but there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that
affected us automatically. There was a movement in Polish society to promote the
anti-semitism. There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in
Louve and it was moving toward the end that we were worried. We didn't know whether
we had to take any action. In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of
saying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming. In 1939 it was a year
that we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out. I don't
remember other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where
the was bombarded. All the houses, one bomb hit our house. We were
then in our basement, actually in the cellar was where the winery was, but we no longer
had the winery but we had the cellar. A bomb hit just a part of our house, just a part of it,
but it was -- the damage was done not directly to our houses in general, but the staircase,
for example, which were concrete staircases, were they were marked and there were
some splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was
damage in it already. When we were in the cellar we had some other friends and some
people were in the cellar and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while
that I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage. We didn't see any fire.
Nothing was really down other than one portion was hit and there were some other
buildings that were attached to our house and we checked that and I remember my
brother said well, there's not much damage to our hiding place. So, that I recall that we
were hit by a bomb. Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the
beginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that Poland
was divided into two major areas with the lights somewhere west of Louve and the
Russians came in. This was a new era that we began. The Russians occupied the eastern
part of and was part of that territory. I recall when the tanks
were rolling down from coming from and they were
huge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge tanks and apparently they didn't have to
fight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate area. If they were they
were somewhere else. So, there was no conquest to be bragged about. They kept on
moving, and they occupied and our immediate lifestyle had not
changed other than that in the next few weeks there was a proclamation of I think it was
in a few weeks that all the major homes and businesses were confiscated and we had a

new regime and so on. This was the Soviet territory. So that means that our house no
longer belonged to us. And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because
this was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with
money for the loans we had incurred some years ago. So, that was a relief in a way. The
big question was how do you make a living. My mother didn't see how her facial with the
army showed that she was concerned about those things. Eli was basically two years
older than I was. He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to
find himself, and he tried different approaches. He didn't feel like going to the
gymnasium. He never cared for that. My older brother Abe was concerned because he
was one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the
intelligencias for reasons that I don't understand. They would put them in prison which
was on -- I recall that prison being called . Whether they were arrested
or not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at home. During that period of time, 1939
and into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as
Eli. I continued to study. I continued to go to school, the gymnasium until that time. The
subjects my studies were now basically new. First of all since Jewish -- this was a Jewish
gymnasium, we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language. That
was a surprise. In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with
the Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay. My mother also
makes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language.
She used to, back in '39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English. I was
better in English than I was in French. That's how I picked up some of my English
language. But in the Jewish gymnasium we picked up two more languages and I was
quite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew
alphabet. You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it. In the Russian
language it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware
of that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that
we picked up two more languages. The life under the Russians don't have too many bad
recollections other than that during that period of time more since Poland was divided
into two areas, the German area which is the line, quite a few refugees were coming more
so from the western part of Poland to our area. Of course the Germans occupied the
western Poland so they were directly under the German authority. And Jews were fleeing
from that area. I recall that in my class in we received at least three
German students one was from , one was from Berlin, two were from
Berlin and one from . And there was another fellow who was also a
student. He was from Czechoslovakia. I don't know he escaped probably from
Czechoslovakia, but not Czechoslovakia per se. He was from the Bohemia part that was
occupied by the Germans. He escaped into Poland and then to the western part of Poland.
He came to us to the Russian occupied part. In all, they were very jolly fellows. I was 14
or 15 at that time and of course the fellows from Berlin they tried to speak either Polish
or Russian and they had a horrible accent and they just couldn't get through because their
Russian language and the German language they just don't put together. They used to
pronounce things in German that the pronunciation it was funny for us to listen to them,
but the were wonderful fellows, very, very good boys.

A: No, they did not elaborate other than would I think would happen was the whole family
escaped Germany to Poland so there were no problems with the family and they hardly
spoke about any events that involved them. They were boys. They were my age. They
were more interested in soccer games. They were more interested in learning the
language, how to deal with us because we were actually and they were the
Germans so we were basically -- they were not even of Jewish nature. We were Jews. We
knew the Hebrew. We knew the laws. They were not that much involved. They didn't
care about that. Not that we cared either because we were actually just a part of our lives.
We were not frightened to bring them into our way of life. They had their way of life. So,
they did not mention anything of their event. The refugees who were coming in more and
more from the western part, from Poland, we felt that we better slowly but surely being
overwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the western part of
Poland was just bad. They were claiming that the concentration camps are being
established. they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on. We thought in
because we knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't
have the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the Ukraine, but these were true
persecutions they were telling us. We didn't understand what a concentration camp
means. It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that. It wasn't a part that he
would accept that, it just wasn't acceptable. We didn't know what people would do in
concentration camp let alone the establishment and how do you so things people ignored
that part. But as they were coming, more by thousands, the shed that we used to have at
home, we have opened up, the salon and the special section room. We gave it up for them
to dwell on it, to live in there. We had a large kitchen and we offered them everything we
had. They stayed with us. Some of them took to work. Some of them moved out on their
own, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who
came who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left
some other people back home wherever their home was. There was quite a few from
, from Warsaw from -- I don't recall the small towns in the western part
of Poland. So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a
knock at the door, we had a big house in . It was the Russians came in and
they forced themselves into our place and they basically took all of these refugees. That
was traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major
expulsion of the refugees from to Russia. And we befriended some
people there, so we were not far away from the main station. I run into that, and they put
them in boxcars and a cattle trains, cars and they were locked up over there. That's how
they were going to transport them from to east to Russia. We couldn't
do anything about it. I knew they were crying, really crying. What did they do wrong?
These were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the
Jews. They didn't kill them, but they put them away. We found out later that they were
sent to and to different parts of Russia. I never met them again. Life in
continued after that expulsion until another war broke out and that
was in 1941 and that was the time when the main when the Germans invaded
. Can we stop for a second?

Tape #2
A: So when the Germans occupied there was a part that we didn't
--when I saw we, I'm talking about the family. The family, my mother or my brothers and
I was just a boy listening to what's happening, what surrounds us. We were concerned yet
there wasn't much that we could have done even though that it would be an immediate
danger. Our immediate danger would have been from the local people that we would be
threatened by. As I mentioned before we lived in , which the majority
of people were actually Jewish people, but also the minority were the Ukrainians and
Poles. We were not quite sure how to take it, what really happened, although we heard a
lot that the Germans are very threatening people. We soon found out that the first few
weeks in Louve after the German occupation of Louve, there were quite a few robberies
and personal insults and personal beatings of Jews by the Ukrainians. Some of them were
maybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe Polish, but it was very dangerous to go out.
It was very dangerous to walk on the street. Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow
the Jews to walk after certain hours, evening. That was maybe just as good, but the
problem that we actually had when it came to night, that was the time when the main
robberies and the main assaults on Jewish families began. It was the night first 1:00, then
2:00, then 3:00 in the morning. They would rush into the house and if they couldn't find
anything, they would destroy or maim people. Only during the night could you hear the
night cries, the night help rescue, seeking help. This was horrible right during the night.
We, at home we were basically safe because on the first floor we had a tenant that used to
live and apparently he was a . He was half German and half Polish, I think.
They occupied that level and they actually controlled the gate, not that he would help us
directly but people know that somebody's -- Snyder I think was his name, he lived in that
house, so we were basically protected. But you could hear at night the horrible screams
being robbed and maimed and so on. It was a very bad period, but it wasn't getting better
because every week there would be new regulations and new instructions and at one point
and I don't recall exactly the month, we got instructions that we had to vacate the
premises, the homes, where we used to live, and move into a small ghetto that was
. To find a dwelling and to move out, and we didn't have that much
time. The furniture, the paintings, the rugs that we had, some of that Snyder took in his
possession. He felt where we were going we wouldn't need them. All the beautiful
paintings my father bought in Vienna, and the rugs. It's immaterial now, but at that time it
meant a lot to us. So, we moved out with a basic one couch and some of the belongings
that we had from the whole flat. It was my mother, myself, I'm not sure if Eli was there.
My oldest brother, Abe, he was no longer with us. He was taken away just before we
moved out to that small ghetto. He apparently went to a hospital to get some medicine.
He never came back. He had to go downtown to where later on it became the major
ghetto. It seems to me it was close to the ghetto. He went there and he
never came back. We didn't know what happened to him. We heard that later on one
hospital was emptied by Gestapo or by people who worked with the Gestapo. They took
them away. I'm not quite sure when was established.
wasn't even at that time a bad word. But we heard . is
an area where Jews were killed and it was adjacent to camp. But we
heard that word . So, he was not with us. Eli was in and out of our area,

our home. Not quite sure what he was doing. I'm sure he was trying to survive, trying to
find some angles to get out of a bad situation. We moved out to that small ghetto. A
secretary to our business who used to be our secretary, she used to live in that area, in that
small ghetto in a free standing home and she offered her house to my mother. I don't
know the deal that she made with my mother but at least we were secure that we had a
house to go to and that was a relief because at that time it was very difficult to get an area
because you're talking many thousands of people had to move out of one area to another
area where you have a comparable exchange of dwellings. It wa questionable, but we had
it. With our house in that free standing house and I recall there were maybe three rooms
perhaps and there was another family that moved in with us. Now, it was a period of time
that we acclimated ourselves into this new ghetto. The faces that we didn't know before
all of a sudden we knew them very well. They were all Jews. The way I understand that a
Jewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the ghetto and our
ghetto. We were not much concerned with them, other than there was
another area that we were quite ambivalent that we did not know what that all means to
us. We all of a sudden have a new life in a new ghetto, new people, new surroundings.
The future, who knows what it's going to bring. The rumors were actually in that ghetto
that those people who work will be much better off if they don't work, meaning that you
better have a place to work and then you'll be getting some kind of identification card that
will help you survive. Survival really didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the
point where you had to survive somehow not knowing of camps or anything of that that
we are immediately placed in jeopardy of our lives. That didn't grasp yet. We weren't
involved in that. We were involved mostly in our personal belonging, in our personal
lifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums because you are a Jew you are no longer a
human being. The ghetto didn't mean to us that this was the end of our line. It was
perhaps the end of persecution by the Ukrainians. You were not directly confronted with
the physical abuse, the physical maiming of people. The rumors were you better get
work. That was in '41. I was 16 years old, and I wasn't -- didn't know where to find work.
Where do you find work in ghetto and I run across a friend of mine who told me that
there is a place on Street who -- and they called it that
they're looking for some workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough. I didn't
know what the work consisted of, but anyway it was something to look into. I went back
to my mother and told her that there is a place that I was told that they're looking for
some workers and whether she would allow me to go interview. My mother didn't think
that she objected other than she warned me be careful. I went there. I went to
. They called it later on . isa
factory or was a factory that made tar paper for the roofs and the way they were doing is
you roll out a three foot section of paper and you dunk it into asphalt. Later you roll it out
and there are some people who were using dry sand and covering the wet asphalt and that
becomes a tar paper. What they were looking for workers who could carry balls of paper
75 to 80 kilos of paper to go from one place, say from a truck to the depot that they had
right in the back, or storage place, and I wasn't sure that I could do that, but if that meant
to have an i.d. and be protected I better do it. I walked into the office and told them that I
would like this work if they could have me. There was man called Fessel. He was a Jew
from Slazia, it was in Poland, and he looked at me and close to him there was a foreman,
a Polish foreman. I forget his name and he asked me can you use this young fellow and

he says yes I can only if he can carry that ball. He took me out and tested me out, and he
selected the largest ball, 75 kilos. Every ball was numbered and I picked it up and I
carried it and I dropped it the place where he wanted me to drop it and he hired me on the
spot. You can work with us. It was basically not a relief for me other than that I felt that
I'm employable. I went back home told my mom that I have a job and maybe we'll be
more secure. From there on it was very little things I recall other than I was working
every day with them going back from ghetto to or .
It's maybe a 20 minute walk, maybe 30 minutes. So, at that time, I was going back and
forth and my mother all day long I would be working and evening I would be coming
home. At the same time I was able to purchase some produce at the place I used to work,
like tomatoes and maybe bread although we could buy some bread but we were rationed
in ghetto. So, it was helpful. I don't recall at what point they have established living
quarters in . It was some time later than -- I'm trying to recall
something which I'm not quite at ease with me. Let me say the time sometime in August
of 19-- it was in '42 already. I did work a number of months. It seems to me going back
from ghetto to and here I'm blank a certain period of time that I
cannot recall. The image that comes to my mind now is August the action. We called it
, where that small ghetto in was basically almost
evacuated. Practically all the Jews were taken and I was at that time in
‘ was located on Z6tkiewska Street. The main
entrance was from which was the main thorough between north and
south. And it was the area which would be within a couple blocks of where my home
used to be, a couple blocks from my uncle's it used to be and so on. There was a time I
recall when the action came about in the ghetto and it was close to
evening. Somebody rushed into the factory one of our workers. They were moving them
out to the street. We moved out, I moved out immediately to the gate to see what we
wanted to see. We saw what we didn't want to see, thousands and thousands of ghetto
people were moving and going to Street. I looked and I saw some of
my friends. My friends, dear friends that I used to play with. Some acquaintances. I was
looking for my mother. I didn't see her, didn't find her. It was maybe twenty rows and
miles of people. They were slowly marching. They were guarded by Ukrainian
. I didn't see any Germans. Maybe in the back, but I didn't see them.
Mostly Ukrainian on each side. I didn't see the front either. I came right in the middle. I
didn't see the beginning the march, I didn't see the end of the march. I just kept on seeing
the area where it was visible to me from that narrow gate. They didn't see me. I saw them
because the gate was actually locked, the gate. It was going on for hours
and hours because there was a slow march. Finally it ended. People were looking from
the windows because all was inhabited by Ukrainians and Poles,
second third stories, they're all looking at them. It was a very grim sight. I don't recall -- it
was the following day that I decided to go to the ghetto. Although they warned me not to
go, they I mean Fessel and the director of the factory. At that point in time I did already
have my i.d., the identification card. I don't recall whether I had to wear a band or not. I
probably did, but I don't recall that. But I got into ghetto because I wanted to see what
happened to my mother. I rushed into the house. The house was empty but the hiding
place where we had the hiding place for my mother was a couch. A couch consisted of a
frame and on top of the frame there was this soft part which is the couch. You couldn't

tell whether that couch was separate for anyone else it was one part. The frame and the
couch, the upper part was one unit. That's why when there was any action, my mother
would be hiding there. I would make sure of that. When I got home, the upper part was
moved so I was scared of that. When I cried out for my mother she came to life. She was
there. She was on the inside of the couch so even it was moved, she was in that area. She
was wrapped around in a blanket, a dark blanket. So even though they were looking for
her, they didn't find her. She was there, so we had our moment, with my mother. A
number of weeks went by before another action came about. I think during that action I
lost my mother, and I don't know how they got her. So, she was gone. Eli was gone, Abe
was gone. It was a part of that they have then decided to establish a living quarters, I
think, on the premises of .

Q: Can I ask you something before we get to the living quarters?

A: Sure.

Q: What happened to your grandfather and Miriam?

A: My grandfather died during the Russian time. He died -- I don't recall but it was during
the Russian occupation and he was buried in a grave yard. We felt that this was a very
timely death for my grandfather to die, not to see everything. But it was definitely during
the Russian occupation that we were not harassed at that time. Aunt Miriam she stayed
with us. Aunt Miriam did not have a good rapport with my mother, but at the time of that
bad time, they changed their minds or they have relaxed their anger or whatever it was,
they were back together, at least on a talking basis. If I recall, she moved with us to the
small ghetto. At what point she was taken I don't recall. But I don't recall her that much
although I really liked her. She was one of the intellegencias, but she was a strange
person to many eyes, but not to me. I was her favorite, but what happened to her, I don't
know. I don't recall. Whether she was taken, the action I don't know because from there
on I did not see her. I don't recall where she went.

Q: Tell me something about Eli and your family? Were you angry at him for not sticking
with your mother at this time?

A: No. Eli was very special to me. He was 17, 18 at that time and he had his own friends. He
had many girlfriends. He always looking for money. He needed money. I was more of a
family son. I was closer to my mother and assuring that everything was under control and
Eli was not the opposite of me and he wasn't completely with me as I would like him to
be. Abe was completely different. He was much older than we were. He was ten years
older. He had his own friends. He had very little to do with us. He would want to talk to
me other than in Hebrew. He despised Polish language, so he would only speak Hebrew
to me, and I had to respond to him also in Hebrew. Although my Hebrew wasn't that
good, but I carried on a conversation with him. It was something that I wanted to impress
my brother Abe at one point in time there was a Serbian or Yugoslavian king or
Rumanian king that abdicated sometime in 1938 and I tried to tell him this in Hebrew. I
don't know whether he responded to me, but this was the time I recall an event that I tried

to impress and I wanted his assurance. Abe was a little bit on the snobbish side because
he was always with his friends talking about zionism, talking about the world's affairs.
He tried to settle all the world's affairs. Eli was completely different from both of us. He
was more or like a happy go lucky fellow. He wanted to live now not tomorrow. Now is
the day. Since he didn't have that much, he would take certain things from home and sell
it to satisfy his needs, and I was fighting with him. I wasn't angry with him, but I tried to
preserve things that the family had. He understood that very well, but he was my favorite
brother because maybe we were fighting all the time and we loved each other and he used
to give me some secrets and at night he used to take me outside the house and we would
be smoking. So, I kept things in secret. He was very good natured, though. He cared
about us. Now, Eli was taken away from us some time. I really don't know when. He was
taken away from that small ghetto. Now I heard that Eli was in concentration camp in
. We weren't sure that this was a death camp, but it was very

fearsome place to be in. The fact that we heard that and people are being
killed there. Even though that I heard that Eli is there, I felt always that when Eli is in a
tight spot he always will get out. At least I hoped so. When established
the living quarters, I was one of them. We were a crew of 40 Jews only men. It was a
place where we felt was a very safe place at least for the time being. Even it was safe
place that we had within the 40 people there were certain groups that were more confined
with each other than others. Probably psychologists would love to study those groups. I
was basically with a group of boys my age. The 16, 17, and 18 and the question is how do
we get some cigarettes. That was the main thing at that time. The ghetto was gone. There
was nothing that I can do any more in ghetto. I didn't want to go anymore there. As a
matter of fact it was a Jew free area. The only thing that was dominant was actually the
downtown ghetto on Street and Street. That was the
area. I did not know too much about things that surrounded us because we were confined
in a given area and the only thing that we heard was the rumors that would come in. Even
papers didn't come in. We didn't have any papers. So, the 40 Jews, even though we were
together, they had such secrets. I didn't know what the secrets were. I learned later on
apparently they built an extra wall. There was a basement where we used to live. On top
there was the factory and the basement was the living quarters and in that basement they
erected a wall which was done sometime probably before the action in August. I didn't
know that. Nobody let me know that. So, a lot of things -- in a way I was a little angry
that they didn't let me know that because I could have brought in my mother, into the
hiding place. It was a hiding place. It was a whole wall and in that false wall, false
partition, it was covered with wood, piles of cut wood that when at night at 12:00, 1:00
they would remove the wood and people would walk out for fresh air. Even at that time I
didn't know that. I found that out later. When I was living in time where maybe I was too
ambivalent, to naive of knowing what was going on. But, they were Jews. Families of
some of these 40 people and when I learned later on that there is a hiding place and I just
hoped that Eli would be alive so I could bring him here. My work at that factory
consisted of working first with the bales, carrying the bales and sometimes just dusting
the asphalt with the dry sand. But then later on since I liked so much horses, we had a
wagon there with horses that we would transport asphalt into the factory. There was one
fellow who was we used to call the foreman. He took care of the horses and the wagon
and he would transport the goods, certain asphalt and some of them he would bring also

some sand to the factory. His name was . And he selected me to be his
helper to care for the horses and so on. I really enjoyed that. I'd rather work with horses
than work in the factory. The foreman of the factory liked also bunnies, rabbits. He had a
cage of rabbits in the stall in the barn and he asked me to take care of them. So, I had the
horses now and I had the rabbits and I used to take care of them. It was pleasant. I liked
to work with animals and at the same time I was the helper of . Lused to
call him . He was a very nice fellow. A very straightforward fellow. He was
Ukrainian. He did not see me as a Jew. I was Wilek to him and he was to
me. I didn't care that he was Ukrainian even though that I knew that the Ukrainians killed
Jews and abused Jews and vice versa. He saw me as Wilek, a fellow. So, he was very
nice to me, he was human. We liked each other. So, I was his assistant in doing anything
that the factory needed, to take care of. Caring for the animals but also transporting
asphalt. This was going on for a number of months. Now, I had an opportunity to go out
of the factory with him and see what was going on. Now, when I drove with him on the
wagon, I did not have a band, I don't think so because I was part of the
. So, we used to drive oh maybe a kilometer or so to get the
asphalt. We had a refinery not far from us within a kilometer or so. And that refinery
there was an area where there was a refinery, there was also a slaughter house for
animals. In that refinery, the bi product of the refinery is asphalt and they would pour out
the byproduct into an area, a depleted area a narrow area not too deep and what we would
be doing is we would be cutting them in blocks because they were solid and carry them
on top of the wagon and bring them back to the factory.

Tape #3
A: So we used to bring the asphalt back to the factory and of course in the process of asphalt

being liquified later on in huge ovens and that's how we get the process of that tar onto
the paper. That was my work in , working with day in
and day out. We were able to drive from our factory to maybe two or three different
streets, and of course at that time Louve, that area any way, was already Jew free. There
were no Jews there anymore. Perhaps some were hidden, but there were no visible Jews.
The place was basically very quiet. It wasn't vibrant as it used to be the times that I recall
back in '38 and '39. We were doing this a number of months and Peter and I we were very
much befriended. We were talking about at times that it could happen that one of these
days they will take me away. The discussion was how do I survive. How do I get out of
this place. I did not have good moves ahead of me. I did not see too many visions, what is
a good way of doing it. In back of our factory there were tracks and those tracks you
could see every so often Hungarian troops going somewhere and the thought that came to
my mind, wouldn't it be nice if I knew some Hungarian language and just jumped in the
cart and said hey, I'm one of you. But it was just a dream. Back with Peter, I told Peter
what's a good way of surviving. He didn't give me a good answer. One day he came and
told me, you know Wilek, if I could hide you I would do that, but I can't trust my wife. I
thanked him for the offer or his thoughts. We had a farmer that would deliver some
produce over a number of years and he was a very good friend of ours. He looked me up
in , and he told me that if you need a place come to us. So, in that
preparation I was very glad that he offered me a place to hide because I was at his house
back on the farm a number of years ago, a number of times on my vacation. He would
take me in to . He had great piergos, it's dumplings with good stuffing. His
wife used to make. I used to ride on the horses with him and take care of his cows. It was
just fun for me to do that at that time. So, he came back, and he looked me up and he
offered me, I had hope. There's a place to go. I had a duffle bag, a leather duffle bag and I
put in some of my clothing, some of my things for him to have it just in case I do get to
escape and get to his place. So, at least I have a place to go. Meanwhile I was working
with Peter. Because I wasn't sure where his farm was, I knew but I really didn't know
where his farm was, and one day, Peter looks at me and says Wilek come over here. Do
you see this lady? There was a lady that was limping that was going to the office. I said
yes I see her. I remember her. I remember her well. He told me that he delivered a wagon
of potatoes there. That was some time early part of 1943 that he delivered a wagon of
potatoes. It was a custom to buy potatoes in huge quantities for winter time and so on.
That was the way we did that in Louve. I asked him what makes him think that she's the
one. I mean how do I know. I don't know but remember her and I'll give you an address
that in case something happens here, you go there. Because he felt at that time that the
director Fessel is grooming her or grooming this place for him to hide. I took this as a
good omen and I felt maybe he's got something there. It was a certain time within that
period of time. It was just before the Warsaw ghetto that it was in April sometime that I
remember that two partisans -- a partisan is a person who's a guerrilla warrior. They used
to belong to a Polish underground, and they spoke to our leadership in to
join their partisan group. I'm not quite sure what transpired but I think our leadership
rejected them. They didn't trust them. It was during that period of time that things are

getting closer and closer of annihilation of the Jewish population in Louve. We knew
about Warsaw and we knew they were fighting. We also knew that the downtown ghetto
is getting tighter and tighter. Very few Jews you could see being escorted on the street,
less and less because until that time you see a group escorted by the militia. People from
ghetto to work from work back to ghetto. Of course we were stationary. The group of the
40 Jews. We were stationary. We live right then and but we see them once in a while and
sometimes I saw on my wagon these groups going back and forth. I mentioned before this
slaughter house and there was one Jew who used to work there and as we were cutting
the asphalt and that Jew across the field would look and wave to me and I would go there
talk to him and ask him what his business was while he goes back and forth from the
slaughter house back to ghetto. But at the same time, he offered me some meat to take it
with me so I would bring that meat back home. Home meaning my
people. I would bring that. Occasionally I would be going from to
ghetto just to go there. I didn't have anyone there. Maybe I would be going with a friend
of mine because he wanted to accompany, but I recall everytime I would be going there, I
wouldn't be going there too often, but I was given an armband with a W letter which was
for meaning that we were working for the , the army, even
though that manager of our factory was a captain in air force which doesn't make sense
but that's the way it was. He apparently was very good, very good. A reasonable human
being. He had an excellent rapport with Fessel. He was I think captain in the air force. He
was the one who would warn us when major problems occurred. At one point, he would
warn us that we were about to be picked up by the guards. We would move out. The way
I dressed myself -- I was dressed myself as a typical farmer. This is the way I could
disguise myself the best, with long boots, with special boot type slacks. They're specially
curved that the boot accepts the slacks and with a hat and a cigarette in my mouth. I used
to roll my own cigarettes so I was a typical farmer. The first time that we were going to
be picked up I just left. I had no where to go. Ghetto was opened. You could go in to
ghetto but who wants to go into ghetto. So I went downtown on Street
where I used to go with friends of mine and prominent the area when we used to be
young boys and free of troubles. It was like three or four o'clock or two o'clock,
something right afternoon that I ran off from and there was very little
you could do downtown other than be picked up by Ukrainians or somebody who
recognized me. I was not, but my safe thing was to do was go to a movie house, so I went
to a movie house just to kill time. After that time thinking just a few minutes ahead, what
am I going to do next? I didn't have the answer. I had to do things that were natural in
that point in time. I saw a movie, another movie, it was newsreel of cutting. This was
where the Germans showed how the 20,000, or 40,000 Polish officers were killed. The
Russians claimed that the Germans killed them. The Germans claim that the Russians
killed them. This was the time that Saw that excerpt. I was all engrossed in that because
for the first time I hear there was a cutting, there was a slaughter of Polish officers but
from the German side. After the movie, I went out and I don't know what time it was but
I saw a column of Jews were going to ghetto. I put my armband and I joined them. That
is the only place that I can go right now short of being right down town without Jews. So,
I joined them and I went over there to ghetto. There was probably a few weeks after the
Warsaw ghetto or around that time. I knew that I had to do something very drastic soon,
but didn't have the opportunity yet. I went back to ghetto. The ghetto was so crowded I

did not feel so crowded in my life because that was the first time I was exposed to that. In
other words, living in in my own bunk in the basement with only 40
Jews was a paradise from what I have seen over here. People were living in the street.
Just a terrible situation. No clothing, torn clothing, and a lady that I recognized who used
to live on the same street, she was a daughter of a grocer. A very pretty young lady, she
was probably in her 30s, I think. She became a prostitute in ghetto. But she took me in
immediately. She was my neighbor, and she gave me some slotties and I left went to
another place to another friends, the same surroundings, and I walked into an area where
some older young men were looking for how do you get out of ghetto. How do you join
the partisans. And I was right in the midst of it. On suggestion was we get a whole group
with the armbands and let some of us be the militia, the Ukrainian militia and escort that
group all the way down all the way down because nobody is going to ask
where are you going with this Jewish group. That was one of the questions. The other
question is where do you the uniforms. Where do you get the arms, and so forth. It was a
round robin exercise, how to you survive yourself. The following day I got word that we
are safe. In other words I could go back to and resume my work. I went
back. I went back to and resumed the work, but now I felt very strong.
It's only time before things happen. There was another major action sometime later, I
forget when in '43, whether it was June or July, a major action and I was told that Eli was
there. He returned that he knew about me and during the action this was on that day
someone else was going to go to ghetto also because of action, rescuing someone. I
joined them. I said I want to go with you. I went and I took an extra armband for Eli just
in case I catch him. I went over there and they told me the address and I went to that
place and there was a lady there, an empty house basically and asked her about Eli. She
said he was here, but they picked him up. I came too late. I was downhearted. There was
a place that very few people should be going through this exercise. As I was walking on
the street, there was one fence there and I hear right on the other side of the fence, people
were praying with a loud voice. During the action and I kept on walking because I had to
get out of that area. They will pick me up but I was secure because I did have the
armband and I had the W and I had the identification stamp. I forget the stamp. It was a
swastika stamp and I think it was a red stamp which was the most recent stamp. So I was
safe. I went through and I got the other people who went with me from
and we made our exit in a hurry. At that time, I didn't see any buses anymore or any
trucks anymore. They finished the action for the moment so we took our exit out. I went
back to . Eli was gone. They took him away. So there was nothing I can
do at this point. He's gone. The whole family is gone as a matter of fact. Now, a few
months went by now and they were talking now about the liquidation of ghetto. I don't
recall when they had liquidated the ghetto other than one point in time just prior that we
were to be picked up they pronounced that Louve is Judenfrau, Jew free. No Jews live
anymore in Louve. Now, the more I'm thinking from there on, I'm thinking more and
more about this lady, the limping lady. Peter gave me that address and he told me exactly
how to go there to get to that place. There was sometime in the morning, I forget when. It
was a beautiful morning as a matter of fact. The sun was out, nice and chilly. Whether it
was September or October, I don't know. It was sometime in the fall one day we were
told that 1:00 we would be picked up. Now, time was early in the morning, maybe eight,
nine, ten. I don't know. I knew immediately that something is going on because Fessel

and Horowitz they were all dressed up. They're ready to move out. They were not moving
yet, but they were ready to move out. I didn't even try to look down in the basement what
is going on regardless even though you have a hiding place, I wasn't about to stay there. I
decided to go, to move because I didn't see any future in hiding in that place. Sooner or
later, probably sooner than later we were going to be discovered, so I didn't take this
place as a safe one. My point was is to get out. The question when, that is within an hour
or so. I went to Peter. I said goodbye to him and I moved out. That was the last time I saw
Peter. He wished me luck and I went out. I kept on walking. I don't remember all the
streets that I went through, I just followed certain streets and I went through a place a
main thorough and right on the street a friend of mine, well, not a friend but an
acquaintance. A fellow I went to school with, to public school, Sayer his name was and
he saw me. He looks at me. Of course he knew that I'm Jewish and I look at him my
question is is he going to betray me. I didn't think so. He grabbed me and we went to a
gate, to a house and I told him I need your help. What do you need? I said I need you to
be here at a certain time, about three o'clock. I don't know what time it was then but there
was plenty of time. I thought I'd need him to go to the station to get my ticket because I
had my farmer in mind. But I was on my way to that lady. Just in case I didn't get any
results there, I'd have a chance to go there and I needed him to help me out to buy a
ticket, a train ticket. I wasn't sure how to buy it. I wasn't sure that part how to buy the
ticket, but besides I needed his help anyway if he could offer me or at least not to betray
me. He said I'll be here at 3:00. What else do you need. I told him I didn't need anything
other than to help me to go through that period of that hour or two. I kept on walking. I
didn't think that I would be betrayed by Sawyer. I didn't think so even though he was
Ukrainian. So, I kept on walking and I went to that place. At first I didn't recognize the
house because he described me a certain house but when I looked at those houses, they
all looked the same. Across the field there was barracks where the Ukrainian militia used
to live. There was an area where I felt well, you do or you don't. I went to one house and
I asked -- her name was Maria, and I knocked at the door, is Maria home? The person
says no Maria here. I'm sorry. Then I went to another door. It must have been one of
those houses so I went to another house. The next time and she opens the door. Maria
was there. Now, Maria doesn't know me. I know Maria. She was limping. She was a good
looking lady, probably 25 to 28, Polish. I asked her that I'd liked to see Mr. Fessel. She
says no Fessel in this house. I said well, probably not but please tell him that one of his
workers is here. She says no Fessel is not here. I said okay. I took off. Maybe I was
misled. I took this as a true sign I was misled my next option is to go to my farmer. I kept
on tracing my steps back, the same way and I was going to see Sawyer. As I walked
down I'd say a good half a mile down the road, I hear some hollering behind me. It was
Maria with her limping legs was after me. She was hollering for me to stop. I finally
stopped and went back, kept on walking towards her and she looked at me. You're so
stupid and some other expletives. Come back with me. And probably I was stupid and
she took me back and walked me right into this room in this house where Fessel was.
Now, my first impression was grim faces because they were not sure how I got that name,
how I got the address because if I could find them someone else could find them.
Obviously true, Peter could find them. This was their main concern. They weren't
concerned about me but about Peter. Peter as far as I have never seen him drunk. And
Peter he was such a friend that he would never betray me. So there was no concern. I

wasn't concerned, they were. The group consisted of Fessel and his brother. His brother
was a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain. He had a German
overcoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow. It
was Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got
in there probably through a different route, but the route that I know how Fessel got into
this house was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his
personal secretary in . So at least two people from our factory, his brother
which I never saw him before, his lady friend. That lady friend was a sister of that other
couple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he
came about there. Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria. So
we had like seven people there. I think there was seven, I was the eighth one. It was a
time where they were concerned about their security because of Peter. The question was
whether or not they should send me back, back to Peter's place home and tell him no one
was there. So, I could go and apparently go back home to their place to secure their
hiding place. It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put
me in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number
of miles to his place. They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was
more of a friend of mine than of theirs. They left it at that. So, now I was not one of them,
but at least I was in a safe place for the time being. The area we were in one room I think
maybe it was another room, but basically I was in the front in the large room that was
together with this hiding family. We had a trap door to the basement which was not in the
walking place but in a crawling space. We had a special area that was covered with a rock
in case something happens we all go inside and hide ourself there. We had our food.
Apparently Fessel had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently
paying also Maria. I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money. I
didn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either.
So, I thought things were taken care of by Fessel. The other couple they also were from
Louve, I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names
because they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort
of in a group relationship, you were strangers. Maybe you had one thing in common, we
are all Jews and we want to survive. There was one thing in common but different
interests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing. So, the dynamics of
our group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations. I could take part of some
of them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group. There
was a point in time the ghetto was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the
concentration camp is being liquidated. The rumors were also that the
Russian army is moving toward Poland, closer and closer. They weren't talking about
immediate occupation or immediate conquer of the territory but it was close enough that
you need to make a decision. Whether to stay in the hiding place or to move on. I did not
take any part of the decision because my action was always to stay in the hiding place. So
that wasn't an option that would be denied to me. The other option was whether or not to
escape Louve all together. There was a young couple who would be coming and in
keeping in touch with us. They had Gentile papers and they had excellent Gentile features
and they would be the ones with whom we had contact with the outside. They would
know how to prepare the papers, Gentile papers and how we could be rescued. Now the
question was should they take me into the rescue effort moving out of Louve. They

weren't even talking about Hungary at that time at all. The question was they're going to
be moving out, should they take me with them. I confronted that part with Fessel and I
told Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I
would like to be with them. I could always stay here, but I want to get out of Louve in
general. This is a horrible place. I don't want to be here, even in hiding. He said well,
we'll have to see what our resources are. We'll have to see if we can give you some
papers. He apparently was good enough to do that for me. I was told that their plan is to
escape ultimately to Hungary from Louve to from to
Mountains, through Slovakia to Hungary. That's the plan. I walked with
them all the way. I'll go with you anyplace you go. I felt that I could be of help to them if
they needed me. The time came sometime in the early part of December I think, maybe it
was in December, that we got our papers, the Gentile papers with our photographs and
the stamps and the my name was . [took the name of an
acquaintance of mine from . He was a very nice fellow and I thought he
ought to have my name. So, from there on, my name was from then
on until my liberation. My religion was catholic, and everything else was true on those
papers. My birth and where I was born, and everything else except my name and my
religion. From there on, there was at night prior to that by the way that was something
very interesting happened that I recall. You know when you are in hiding for so many
months you don't know how to purchase things. How to deal with the outside although
we are informed by Marie where things are, how to get to the station, because now we
have to move from Louve, buy a ticket, and these are small items but very crucial items.
Get out of the house, buy a ticket, go into the main station, buy a ticket and go to
. Finding the place, and find a place and maybe a reservation for the
train or not. That we did not know. Maria was not about to buy any tickets for us, so they
asked me whether I could go on an exercise to the main station, look around, see where
the purchase ticket box is, see if there is anything unusual and go buy the tickets. Well, I
went there. One night they left me and I had to go from the place at night walking
through the fields, through the barracks of the militia and there is a small station. I got to
the station and I got to the main station and to see where I could buy tickets. I went to the
main station, bought a ticket. On the way back to our place and to see the temperament
and the environment we would be going through. When I came back, all the inhabitants
of our hiding place were outside just in case to run in case they caught me and brought
militia with me. They were relieved. I came back. Gave them the report and they were
ready to move on.

Tape #4

Q: Do you have any idea why Maria would want to save Jews or at least save this group?

A: I'm not quite sure. I never asked her. The only thing that I could stipulate was that she
was prearranged prior to that. The fact that I saw her one day in a factory walking
towards the office that means she was prearranged. She was given I'm almost sure that
she was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel. I know other things that during my stay in
the hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that
was the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with
Fessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always
be the winner on that evening. He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game
was over, he would be coming out with money. He knew about us obviously, so he was
paid that way through winning in this game. Other than that, I don't have any other facts,
but Maria a person of no wealth. She had this house and she was with Usak who told me
where she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what
was the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of
human compassion. Maybe it was a combination of both.

Q: Was this a very lonely time for you?

A: It wasn't lonely because I was always active. I was very active. My mind was always
going regardless what was going -- what surrounded me. My question was to myself how
do you get out of this place. I was fierce about it. I was driven by that. How do you get
out and stay alive. Because I felt that I had to say something later on. Maybe this is why
I'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had
to say it, to say that part. So lonely, no I wasn't lonely. I was too dynamic to be lonely.
So, when they saw me coming back from that train station and they greeted me with
enthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our
things whatever I had. I don't think I had anything with me. I just had just my hat, my
jacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go. We went through the main station, got our
ticket. There was a direct train to . It was all night. We went through over
night and the following day we were already in . We were picked up by
the smugglers. Now, let me back off just a bit. That couple who used to come who had
their connection from outside, brought the papers for all of us. That couple that I forget
their name, were left behind because that's what they chose, to stay. All of us left,
including the lady friend of Fessel's brother. By the way, she was pregnant. She was big
and my estimation was that she was in the eighth month of pregnancy, but she was
walking and she was also determined to survive. We were on a train and got picked up
later on in by the smugglers who were previously arranged by this
couple who gave us all the false papers. We went to a place. I forgot this area at the time
where it was that they took us. I remember that we had our lunch with Polish kielbasa.
We had a piece of bread and that evening or that night, we were going to move out of

. Because everything else was prearranged. It was sometime December or

it was early part of January. I don't know that period of time. It was 1944, January or

1944 or December 1943 but very close to that time. I want to say that I am close right on

the verge between December and January. It was very cold and we took a train from
to a small village close to Tatra Mountains. It was basically a ski
resort and we departed from there. We picked up and we kept on walking. It was an area
probably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police. By the way, this area was
strictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and border police.
The smugglers were actually Polish. I forget their name. I forget even their faces but we
got through and we kept on walking through the Tatra mountains. The episode that I
recall was walking in the snow. It was so called and also the snow was very deep. The
surface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into
a trap because you couldn't get out. It was a very difficult walk. Now, the lady who was
pregnant she had a horrible time walking. At least I had boots but I don't recall if she had
boots. So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her.
No one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph. The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart
problem. He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that
mode. I was young. I felt good. I was strong and I tried to help her. I did help her. I kept
on walking with her. At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her and
embracing her and kept on walking but at least we were in step with the rest of us. At one
point in time I asked Fessel to help her because I was getting tired and I asked Usak to
help her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they
wouldn't survive the trip. I couldn't leave her. I had to walk with her and I walked her and
a long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out. Such a
shame, but we survived. We went through the Tatra mountains and got into Slovakia. At
least we were there. We were so called safe and the boarder police grabbed us. They took
us into a place which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified
ourselves as refugees from Poland, so we were all Polish. So, from this police area I think
they took us into a school. We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for. I
don't recall how long we stayed there. There was another couple from Poland,
independently they came in. They were refugees. One was a professor | think, a Polish
professor with his wife, and some other people. At that point they took a picture of us that
I had it but I lost it during my other events but Usak got it and showed me some time
later. The object has to move from Slovakia now to Hungary and within a few days I
think we were moved from Slovakia to another border town which I have a hard time
remembering. It was comes to my mind. Maybe I'm wrong but
was the border. There were some Jews -- see Hungary at that point in
time was not occupied. It was the early part in January. If I recall well, when I was
already in Hungary, Hungary was occupied in February by the Germans, maybe a later
part of January but not the early part. We were brought in and and
there was a Jewish couple that took us in for that evening. It was a Friday I think and the
reason I remember was because there was shobotz and they offered us LA
is a meal a Jewish meal with beans and chicken and carrots and all that good
stuff. It was very good, very tasty. This was the first time I was exposed to it. 1 was very
grateful for it. The following few days from because we wanted to g into
Budapest and that was our goal because from there on Fessel had his plans. I had my
plans so once I got into Budapest which we got into Budapest within a week or so. I don't
remember that period very well, but I remember that we were in Budapest and the
question was we were not occupied at that time so we were free and I identified myself

with the Polish organization with all there were different refugee camps, not camps but
offices and you reported yourself that you are one of them. Whether they helped us or not
I don't recall. It was immaterial to me. What I wanted to do to identify myself that I am a
Polish refugee and to be on their books. From there on it was just a matter of finding out
your level of survival. Where do you go from there. The trigger point was the time when
the Germans again invaded Hungary. That was the trigger point, be on the run. You had
to run again, and where to you run. By that time I had already met some people, not
friends, but acquaintances, we became friends because they were in the same shoes. The
same problem, where do you run. One thought was to run to get into Turkey. The way
you could get to Turkey was through Rumania. The other thought was to run to
Switzerland, means you had to go through Austria. Which route do you explore. You
explore them both, but one is less dangerous than the other. I felt to be in Switzerland
would be a good deal to do, but to go you had to Austria. That was bad. A better way is to
go through Turkey through Rumania. I had friends that became my friends that were in
the underground movement and I joined them. Some of these people were mostly Jews.
Some Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going
to run somewhere. I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the Polish
underground which was a/k Army Crawly, was a group that I wasn't sure I would be
comfortable with, so I went with that Jewish group. Even that group, I have some Polish
members. I was in a cell. Seven people, we had seven people in our cell. I wasn't given
orders to carry out. Basically I was a courier for them, transferring papers from place to
place, mainly from Buddha to Paris and from Paris to Buddha and so on. At one time I
had to go outside Budapest, but this was a short trip and I came back. One time I had to
carry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing some carry out orders and I felt good about
it. I'm doing something about it. Friends of mine, they were also printing false papers,
false birth certificate, false statements of good standing of a given community and so on.
Church papers I mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian
Jews. Not specifically for Polish refugees. We were all saved so called. The question now
is how do you help out the Hungarian Jews. They needed the papers. They did not have
the flexibilities that we did have because we were right outside. There was a time that
they were mostly almost confined to the house ghettos. They already had the stars. They
had to carry, we did not. We were free. I happened to get myself with the underground
and they advised me to have two or three residents in Budapest, having a place to live in
Buddha, in Pess -- in Buddha I had to places where to live and when I chose a place to
live, I used to live always with a Christian family. I was safe there. Although I tell you I
feel at time whenever there was a knock at the door, there was always a heart beat, an
extra heart beat that I have developed later on in my life because somebody is knocking
at the door at the wrong time and maybe for the right purpose or for the wrong reason as
far as I am concerned. So, there were time when they were raiding some areas, but this
was in Gentile areas. I never lived with Jewish families, not in Budapest. But there were
raids just in general and I was one of them, but I never had an occasion to be examined
and to be found that I had any problems with them being either question whether I was a
Gentile or not. As a matter of fact, I used to go with those families to the church every
Sunday morning, and to be one of them. It was that kind of life that we tried to provide
papers to the Jewish people in Budapest. Papers, birth certificates, status certificates and
so on. Being in Budapest right in the midst, I'm almost angry with myself not knowing of

. [never heard of him, even in the close circuits that I was that we knew
how to survive things. No mention about Swedish consulates and so on. I don't know if I
would have gone that route, but at least I was never exposed to that. Friends of mine were
exposed to Switzerland and they went that route. I understand he never made it. Another
friend went through to Turkey. It was a perfect Gentile couple who had went through a
reverse of circumcision. They were perfect in the physiotomy. They got through
and through Rumania but they were torpedoed in the Black Sea I
understand, so they never made it either. I was still there in Budapest and the question
was when I'm going to get out of it and one day I have an order to go to Rumania because
I have asked for them to send me to Rumania and to get in touch with other underground
in Rumania. They send me and they told me who to see, when I get over the boarder,
what to send them. The question was whether or not the border between Rumania and
Hungary is safe. Of course, I was told that the reason they are sending me is to get that
message to the other side, to Rumania. Later on I found out that the reason they sent me
was to find out whether the border was safe. So, it was one of those things that you have
to take your chances. I did not know about that. I found that on later on when I was sick
and back in Germany, that I wasn't told the whole truth of the matter. Shortly I went out
from Budapest directly to . | think that was the name, that was the city,
and I had to pick up those two smugglers who were going to take me to
Rumania. The way they identified themselves is by folding hands two of them and they
were there, they were waiting for me. And they took me and we were not far from
: was the village I think right on the border between Hungary
and Rumania. They took me to a place to a barn that's all I remember, a barn. Apparently
I didn't sleep all that long and I was so exhausted I just fell asleep before someone burst
into that barn and it was the Hungarian . with the black hats
with a pheasant feather. From there on they interrogated me. I did not have too much with
me. I didn't have any money. I had a couple hundred penco, which is minimal. I didn't
have any papers other than my own identification paper and that's all I had. I had a few
photographs that got me into trouble later on, but they were mostly interested about my
spy mission. What was I carrying, why kind of message was I carrying to Rumania. This
route by the way was known as a route the Jews were fleeing away from Rumania. There
was one lady that I recognized her as being Jewish and she was in that interrogation
room. They whisked me away from her later on. She was crying. Later on I also saw
those two smugglers in another circumstances. They were beaten very severely. Their
faces were black and blue, so at least from my prospective they did not betray me,
someone betrayed them and in turn I was also betrayed. I was interrogated for a number
of hours. I don't know at what point they transferred me, they deliver me to the gestapo.
By the way, from that place they took me back to where it was the
headquarters of gestapo. I was escorted by the Hungarian gerdeams. The gerdarms they
were actually the border police but they had some other special assignment. They were
the leaders of the police force in Hungary. I stayed in maybe a few days
and I was again interrogated.

A: Yes, I was beaten. I was beaten terribly. In other words they put a bar between your legs
and then your whole body is folded downwards and you're beaten on your feet. Of course
on the buttocks and so on. It was very painful, but I took it. It wasn't a big thing that I
recall it was impossible not to survive. They wanted to know again, what was the
message that I was trying to deliver to Rumania. Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being
Jewish wasn't their concern apparently. I don't recall that. Whether they took it for
granted one way or the other, I was never told. The main idea for them was to move me
as soon as possible back to Budapest and they took me back to Budapest and they put me
in a political prison on . That was the political prison in Budapest
and I stayed there for a number of weeks or months almost. I'm not quite sure how long.
It was there that I met other some of my acquaintances from Budapest. I met
who was the ambassador from Hungary to Poland who spoke perfect
Polish language. I also met across the court a lady name who later on I
found out she was Hanna . She was very resourceful to convey her name one
letter after another. There was a time probably that I recall because we were seeing
at one point in time. It was a period when it was Yom Kippur. It was a
time that if I want to tag a point it was Yom Kippur 1944. was still alive.
definitely was still alive because I corresponded with him later on after the
liberation. I was interrogated almost daily because not only they wanted to know what
was my message but the unfortunate thing was they found a picture in my possession. A
fellow that I befriended in Budapest who was from Berlin, he was also a Jewish refugee
but for some other reasons I befriended him and we were dating girls together and we had
fun with him and he was in that prison also. They caught him, so they wanted to know
what was my association with him. So it was a complication. I don't know what happened
to him. I don't remember even his name but he was a very nice fellow. He was a fellow
that I would feel very comfortable to be a friend. Sometime later after 1944 I remember
we were about to be ready to be moved out of this prison and we were told that they are
going to send us to some kind of camp. It must have been some time in October because I
recall I got in, they brought us to Auschwitz and it was on my birthday, October 29, 1944
that we walked on that platform. It was a train, from a regular train and they brought us
immediately to this office. They tattooed us. Now, my name was 193 229, no longer the
name . There was no other names but my number. The time in Auschwitz I
have very little memory of it. I did work there. I did get this uniform. I had the cap, with
the stripe. Whether they gave me some wooden shoes I don't recall. Probably they did,
maybe I did have it. I did have it I think, I did have it, the wooden shoes. I was one of the
inmates now. I was in one of the barracks, surprised that I don't even remember the
number of the barrack because you must remember that. I don't remember that. Maybe I
don't want to remember, but we were close to that barrack where there was a special
barrack where things were -- a punitive barrack and I was told to stay away from it, that
barrack. Not much, I don't think that I was ever concerned about being gassed. My only
question was how do I get out.
Q: You were not there as a Jewish prisoner?
A: I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I was a Jewish prisoner or not. It seems to me I was among
Jews so I was a Jewish prisoner. Until a given day that a barrack was empty and they

were selecting people left and right, left and right, and they selected me. I think it was a
left position and then within an hour or so they pulled me back. Took me back into my
barrack. It was at that time that I realized that I am somehow protected and when they
look at my tattoo oh you're a , that's the word that | all of a sudden get to
my mind, a protected inmate, prisoner whatever. But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or
not a Jewish prisoner, I was a Jew with them and it really didn't matter at that time what
my status was because I was one of them. One major event that I recall wa the hanging of
five Polish prisoners who escaped Auschwitz. When they were brought back, they took
out the whole camp to watch the hanging. That was sometime probably in December. It
was awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the
morning when the hanging took place and after the hanging normal life proceeded in the
camp. Then again there's a gap that I don't recall what was going on, just a matter of daily
consumption of the stale bread. The bread came from the transports from the wagons
from the trains, but we were given stale bread. It was just at least it was something to eat.
The food was very terrible, very thin soup, just water. But I was not -- didn't feel that bad.
I still felt that I could withstand the ordeals and whatever took place because they were
talking about soon there's going to be some liberation because Russian troops were
moving in closer and closer. As a matter of fact, our thought was that
was already taken. Maybe it was a hope, maybe it was not, but anyway they were very
close. So, the recreation of Auschwitz was almost eminent. January 5, comes to my mind
but I'll stand corrected if it was something else. We were evacuated from Auschwitz and
we walked a long time to another station, and I don't recall too well but we were put into
open carts, only men. I hadn't seen any women, and they took us out. A horrible trip, a
horrible trip, people were dying because of this cold exposure. I had frostbite on both
feet. They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me
personally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive. I
always felt that I could survive. There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I
couldn't physically move things the way I used to. We were, the train was moving
through Czechoslovakia. I know because I heard that and as we were going underneath
the overpasses, they were covered with a lot of Czechs and they were throwing bread to
us in the open cart. It was a good omen. I had a loaf of bread and Leon, a friend of mine
with whom I've been for since Budapest, that's where I met him, he was with me all along
in the camp. He survived by the way and he was in Israel. He saw me sometime later in
Munich. He visited me in the hospital. We went out and they kept us moving along from
place to place. There was no place that they had in mind. We finally wound up in
, why I don't know. Just before we reached
they were discarding all the bodies from the train and people were
most of them were that majority was alive and there were shot on the spot. It was a huge
mountain of the corpses from the cart. It was molestation. It was all guarded by the SS
and their henchmen. We stayed there perhaps a few hours, they kept us back and we kept
on going, and from there on they took us from to . We
were told that when we came to Flossenberg that we were a sore lot, and we were, but we
survived. , the headings on the sores of my feet, the healed and I don't
recall what I did in Flossenberg other than that I was healthier and a long point in time
the news came to Flossenberg that Roosevelt died and somehow President Roosevelt was
a point of hope to me as long as he is alive, as long as he's in charge, he was the one who

actually initiated the coalition and invasion of Europe. When he died a spark left out of
me because I felt there is not going to be a continuation in the war, but later on a friend of
mine, said another president will take over and he'll continue that. Flossenberg was the
time where it was a step before my liberation. I think they took us out on our way to
Dachau. That's where we were told an Leon disappeared. I don't know where he went, my
friend Leon. There was another fellow, a Russian fellow who was also an inmate and
with whom I befriended. He was my friend now that I tried to help him out from the
actions in Flossenberg. It was three days and three nights of that death march towards
Dachau. April the 23rd we were liberated by the First Army, I think. At that point in time,
I was liberated. I was a free man.
