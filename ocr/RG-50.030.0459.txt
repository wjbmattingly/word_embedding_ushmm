her cooking was so fantastic. And my grandfather was not very kind, so -- but, he was

terribly religious. He went every day to the synagogue, and regularly, and Yom Kippur

usually he was the maftir, and he was ex-extremely proud of it. It’s a pity that he lived

private life, he was completely different. William Blake says somewhere, “Humble to

God, haughty to man.” And well, so was he.

Interview with George Kadar 4
April 24, 2000
A: Yes. My -- My father was exactly the contrary, more than the contrary. He was a
doctor, M.D., and a very good doctor, and an extraordinary man. Absolutely honest and
generous. And his story is a little bit the story of many Hungarian Jews. He was born in
1902, and -- and 1920, he wanted to start his studies, the university, but just in 1920 has

| been int-introduced the findecipherable} clausesnumerus claususclausus, so it means
that, I don’t know, three percent of the students could be Jewish, or four, I -- I -- I -- I
don’t know. S-So h-he had to emigrate, and he went to Germany, and in GeesenGieBen

Giessen], not far from Frankfuert, amineam Main, he -- he became a doctor. And as
he came back, the Hungarian authorities didn’t recognize his diploma, and he had to start
again.
Q: He left Hungary to study in Germany because Hungary had more -- at that time
more restrictive laws?

| A: No, the findecipherable} eclausesnumerus clausus has been introduced, and there
was no place, because they had I don’t know how many Jews, and he -- he has been
refused. So he had to -- he had to look for somewhere -- somewhere else. And -- And so

| he -- he made his studies-, I don’t -- seven or eight years in GieBenGeesen, in Germany.
I think he’s -- he finished in 1928, yes, it was before my -- my existence, and -- and he ki
-- then he went back to Hungary, and he tried to -- to use his diploma, it was no -- it was
not possible. So for family reasons, because my grandfather whom I didn’t know, he was

| a dentist, and this eabinae-cabinet had to be continued, and he agreed to be -- to become
a dentist.

Q: Your father?
A: Yes, under the supervision of a -- of a-another dentist, who made his studies in
Hungary. So I -- I -- I think it’s very confused -- very confusing, but it is -- it was very
confusing. He had a complete diplome -- doctor, M.D., in medicine, from
| GeesenGieBen. And as he came back eight years later, he couldn’t practice alone
because he had no Hungarian diploma, and he -- and so the family had to engage a
Hungarian dentist -- a Hungar -- a dentist having a Hungarian diploma. Meanwhile, he
started -- he -- he tried to organize hi -- this Hungarian, a-uha-and
conification.cognestafcation- indecipherable It wasn’t possible, and somehow, I don’t
know who helped him, he has -- he obtained the authoriz -- authorization to frequent the

from Budapest. So he started again, and he made all this ev-everything, so the -- all eight
| or seven years in PagePécs, and I think I was the -- probably the unique case. | assisted in
hi -- that he was officially made doctor. And it was -- I think it was quite late, sa -- like --
something like ’38. Two years, then he be -- he became independent of the other -- other
dentist, because he had a Hungarian diploma. 1940, he has been called to the army, but
the army -- I have the picture -- I have the picture for you. I don’t know if you can
reproduce it. This is the complete misery, this picture, the complete misery of a man who
-- who was a double doctor, and -- and wear this horrible uniform. It took three month,
his absence, and he came back, well 1940.

but i-i-i -- called working -- I don’t know what working, teams. All Jews, of course. And
it finished by -- by the union -- the Soviet Union, the whole thing finished in the -- in the

Q: How did you find out, at what point did you find out what happened to him?
A: Because we received a -- an official paper from the Hungarian army, that he
disappeared. [indecipherable] disappeared or dead, or -- but in this case, because they
didn’t find him, of course because he was a prisoner of war. On the other hand, he --

your home life was like? What -- What did your house look like? What was it like to be
inside of it?

immediately, and then I try -- I -- I -- I -- Isa -- I cried that I want to go home to my -- my

come -- I go home, I learn German, and in May ’38, I come back. But in March,
somebody else took the place, really, so in April we -- we received a letter that due the --
to the events, of course, you understand that your son will not come to Vienna.
Q: If it was stated that subtly, that -- no more specific reference to what happened, just
due to the events, your son will not come.
A: So you ask little bit too much. It was 1938. How do you -- How do you want me to
know in which terms they -- they told -- they wrote to my mother that there was no place
for me any more? Of course, because -- because I am Jewish, and howa -- you know what

Q: The Jewish community. Well, or the -- or your -- or your larger community, if it was a
more mixed.
A: No, I think the way he -- so I -- I -- I’m -- I’m not sure -- I’m not sure to -- to be able
to -- to give you a -- a correct answer, because this happened very long time ago, and as a
child I never analyzed his social, or community, or whatever position. He -- He didn’t
want to live in a Jewish ghetto, and he -- he didn’t want to -- to reduce his interest on
Jewish interests. He -- He made his work extremely honestly, you saw the M.D., and In -
- what I positively know, that he treated people having no money at all, and he never
asked them to pay, because he knew that they -- they was un -- they were unable to pay.
He considered the -- this profession to do something necessary for -- for his -- he --
colleagues, for his -- not only for his friends, but for -- for human beings, and he -- I
remember of a certain Marinka, who was a Gypsy lady, and who -- who didn’t wear
shoes, and -- but who had -- he was -- she had problem with hi -- with her teeth, and so
she -- she knew that he will -- she will not pay, and my father -- my father knew that he
had -- can -- he cannot require -- cannot ask any money because she hadn’t. And so in --
she -- I think this -- this -- this was his -- his -- his exampler -- exemplary, and
extraordinary side, that he considered his profession as really a profession for human
beings, independently of their social level. She had for in -- He had a -- a patient who
couldn't hear at all. She was sewing underwear and -- and then these kind of things, and
sh-she couldn’t pay. She [indecipherable] a little bit underwear for the family, and you --
you couldn’t -- you couldn’t speak with her, because she didn’t under -- she didn’t hear.

if you -- if you are a -- if you are a -- a salesman, and -- and you are not honest with your
-- with your clients -- they say that Mr. Meyer was not honest, but if the Mr. Meyer is a
Jew, then the Jewish -- the Jewish salesman, Mr. Meyer, etcetera. So, to be -- to be a
Jew, it belongs to the profession of the -- to the person, to -- to the imagination of people.
And, you know, I don’t know who -- who is -- who -- who said that the anti-Semitism
doesn’t need any Jews, and you can’t be a ga -- you can’t be an anti-Semite if -- if never,
never in your life, you never have seen one single Jew. It’s all -- I don’t know if you
remember, it happened long years ago, kind of a Gallup question in Austria, it was long

| time before the present regime findeeipherable} -- the actual -- regime -- how many
Jews are in Austria, and people, certain people said 1,000,000, and in fact, I think 7,000,
because the Austrian Jews have been -- have been killed in the meantime. Or, do you
want a nay -- a Jewish neighbor? 30 percent said no. Or, do you want to shake the hand
of a Jew? 30 percent or 31 percent said no. And they really, they ca-cannot know a lot of
Jews.

Q: So then how, as a young man, did you regard being Jewish? I mean, you didn’t have a
lot of input in a religious way, it was an in -- it was a burden in terms your father was.
How did you think about it as your identity?
A: As -- I -- I think I -- I told you what I could, because I don’t know what -- what could
have been added to -- to these outside remarks, criticisms, and -- and so I think you -- you
can, and you must accept the fact. So, as -- if you see somebody who, he only has one
leg, so he -- finally he accepts the fact, it vee -- to live with one leg, is still better than not
to live at all. So, there is a s-simple fact for the --
Q: You’ve talked a lot about your father being very generous, and honest, and you’ve
talked about your mother being very bright. Would -- What things did your parents teach
you?
| A: Thisat is extremely difficult to say, because as I lost my father, I was 13, my mother,
15. And -- And if you th-think of general teaching, I think that -- that my father was more
| important in this domain than-findeeipherable} I think, even if he left earlier. My
mother, it was -- she was different, because we did all the daily light -- th-the -- the -- the
daily life. The preparation of the next -- the next -- the next day, to -- to ask questions of
history or -- or literature, or whatever, because the next day, I had these lessons. And she
learned with me piano -- piano playing, so she -- she sat down and spent hours at the
piano with me every day. So, I didn’t become a pianist, this is -- this is not the question,
but -- but her participation in the -- in the daily life was |-longer and more important.
Q: So you had a piano at home?

A: The family’s political ideas? My father had not -- I -- I don’t think he had particular
political ideas. My mother was more active. A great part of the Hungarian -- of the -- of
the Hungarian Jews in -- in this town went to the -- to the left side. They thought that the

the year 2000, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. This is tape number
two, side A. I’ll begin asking that question again, which is, can you describe how things
began to change in your life, as the new laws were passed, and restricted the ability of
Jews to be in professions, or -- and just as things begin to change in Hungary, and
perhaps you were hearing also about other parts, other countries?
A: No, no, i-it is -- it i -- this thing -- I was not too much concerned, because I went to
school before and after. What really happened, that in Hungary, there was so-called
| Levente-mozgalom, Leyanther-findecipherable} LeventeLeyanther, old Hungarian Formatted: Font: Bold )
name, and it was in Germany the old -- old names came -- came up with these different
| Fascist or semi-Fascist movements. In Hungary, LeventeLeyanther, and -- and it meant Formatted: Font: Bold }
that in the school, one -- once in the week, three hours of patriotism, or -- and the Jews
| couldn’t be LeventeLeyanther, because they were Jewish, and -- and -- but to -- to make
certain works -- this is absolutely no -- no reason, just to -- just to have an occupation
| parallel to the Levente Levanther movement, with -- with yellow armband, because it
was yellow, the Jewish colors, you know, and baptized Jewish who -- so who racially
were Jewish, but administratively not, they had a white armband. And so it is -- it is --
this was diff -- it was different, because the -- this -- the sure friends of -- comrades did
something completely different, so it was a -- the first -- the first place, the Jewish
children were ousted.

A: Yes.
Q: School-wise?
A: Yes. No, not from the school, from the movement, so they -- cause they -- the not
Jewish peop -- the not Jewish colleagues made -- made something different. The second
thing was deportations started from other countries earlier than in Hungary. And once, in
Friday evening, the -- this famous rabbi made a great speech, and par -- and it was, I
think, about -- about Christmas. Christmas -- the Christmas tree apparently has been
invented by Martin Luther. And Luther propose also to send out the Jews to work. And
in connection to this, he said that he positively knew that locked trains trasversed --

| traversed the gare uard--- the railway station of our town. He didn’t know where they
were going, but he -- he knew that they came from Italy. And -- And he suggested that
Jewish families forget about the Christmas tree this year. I don’t know, I -- how we
reacted in this time, but -- but we -- but he knew the deportation was in the neighborhood.
He didn’t n -- He didn’t say that the next victim, ou-ou-ourselves, but he warned us
against something. So this was -- this was nothing in relationship with the hung -- with
the law, but it was in relationship with the time of the law, approximately.
Q: Do you remember what your thoughts were when you heard that story?
A: I think that we reacted as people who do not g -- do not want to -- to accept the fact of
Auschwitz. It was a kind of -- of a fly away from the -- from the reality, and to unde --
and to understand that Hungary will continue t -- a-as I told you, as independence, as far

Q: Was there ever earlier -- or ever, that you remember, any talk of your family leaving
Hungary, perhaps trying to go to a neutral country, just out of Europe, let’s say.
| AQ: I see -- I told you that my father was in the quota, so h-he -- he knew why he did it,
and -- but somehow, I think that in the family, he wasn’t taken very seriously because --
because he -- he said several times that this is the train, which he will ta-take to go to see
| Italy. There was a dear -- a direct -train extremae-between Budapest and -- and Venice,
and I don’t know where it -- I think Buda-Budapest -- Venice, with beautiful Italian
cars, beautiful. And -- And he couldn’t realize this dream because he had no money, and

convinced, as I was, I don’t know. But we were together, we wer -- we went together, and

A: The atmosphere in Hungary, there was an excellent German paper, which called

by Hungarian Jews, who -- who knew German, who knew really German. And it went so
far into parliament, an interperlation happened, or happened li -- has been done a

we had 56 years ago. I -- I don’t know, but I -- but I -- I do know that we are no -- we are

difficult.
Q: Do you remember any of your thoughts at that time, or conversations perhaps, with
your mother?
A: No. No. On there -- there -- you know, I 0 -- I wouldn’t say that I -- I was a child in
the -- 15 is a little bit more, but I was always terribly interested by trains and bus. You
know, it bi -- I wanted to become a bus driver, and -- and I -- for instance, I al-always
wanted to go to a certain Hungarian town which I never seen, and -- and when -- when
the -- this -- the train stopped in this ware -- in this -- this town, and behind the station
there was a -- a tramway, I was very interested by the tramway, the color of the tramway
in this town, and -- and I learned, for instance, the water, drink water in s -- Slovakia,

| which called pit nawoada, and I learned this word dur -- in this -- in this locked train,
because it -- because it di -- it was also interesting. Or the -- in the blue light of trains, or

very interesting. So, you -- you cannot consider it like a death march, pure -- pure death
march, A, because we didn’t know it, B, because the life is so colored. And so if you -- if
you -- if you -- if you are in a horrible situation, and you see something else, you hear a
bird whistling, or what, so the -- you -- your attention is spread.

Q: Do you remember when you -- how did you realize that people were being killed with
gas at Auschwitz? When and how?
A: It’s not the gas, but the -- the -- the fire. Because the fire came out, and very often you
heard a horrible -- you smelled something horrible, which was between burned meat and
fat, and so which was in fact, a human body. And this -- it came out, this fine, black rain.
So it -- it was n-no doubt that people have been killed.
Q: Did people talk about it? The pr -- other prisoners?
A: Yes, of course. In there we had nothing else to -- yes, we had, because the -- the food
was very poor, a kind of artificial jam, and margarine, and we always -- we had a dream,

mix margarine with this kind of jam, and to eat it together. Never happened. They died,

belongs to me, and -- and I -- it is one of my -- my greatest experiences of -- of -- of -- of
life. But I cannot transfer it -- it -- it -- is the -- is the film of shi -- of Schindler, cannot
| be a -- a realistic film, because you cannot find 200-two hundred actors, and to -- to lock
them, and let them lose the weight. So this -- you can’t -- you cannot do it. So if you
can’t, the pictures you will see will be wrong, and will not correspond to the -- to the
reality. So this is not feasible. Only if somebody organized a ki -- a camp, and you went
into the camp, but I d -- I don’t wish you to go there, so these a -- it’s an initial
contradiction in the thing, and -- and I think that what we can, we have to do to -- not to
live with every day, but to think of it, to do -- to know that this is not a normal museum,
this is a museum of the death, and -- and this -- the whole story is the story of the death,
and the death is -- the death -- death is horrible, it’s horrible to die with 15 or fi -- 16. It’s
horrible to die, to -- I -- I knew a lady whose child, I don’t know, three or four weeks old,

lady came back from the camp during this -- during her entire life, hi -- she lived with
this -- with this dead baby. So, this is -- So this kind of atris -- of atrocities, if I tell you,
and you -- you -- you write it down, somebody read it -- reads it, but it’s still a piece of
paper. So this is not imaginable, you -- you are -- you are asking concrete questions, and
this is okay, but as I am not -- you -- you see that I was not able to ex -- to -- to -- to
speak of the ambiance of the selected, because -- because it is -- it is -- it is horrible.
Imagine 200 people in a -- in America, waiting on the electric chair together. What will
they say? Who would cry, who would shout? So, but this is -- this is -- it cannot happen.
Q: I think you just said a lot.
A: So that’s it?
Q: No. I’m just saying --
A: -- who did it is Primo Levi, but there’s no more Primo Levi. Well, I think I could go
at six.
Q: What time is it?
A: Hm?
Q: At the end of the march, how -- what kind of state were you in physically?
A: Ho, I cannot describe you. We have been sent to a building, completely dark, and from
this building, of course by feet to the gareguar -- to the -- to the s -- railway station. Once
more, I remember of the tramway in GleiwitzGlivitz, and I was very interested by this (Formatted: Font:Bold id

prisoners, but normal civilians.

Q: And you’re saying that there’s a sense that the -- the -- the -- that there’s a lot of
movement, and -- and -- and really maybe that the war is winding down, or -- or going to
peak, I guess.
A: Yes.
Q: Yeah. D-Did you begin to start imagining that you might be liberated?
A: Not there. It was impossible. Of course, everybody li -- to liber -- to be liberated was a
dream, but we didn’t know how. And what the Germans did, it was -- it made no sense to
transport Jewish prisoners, and to lose the war. To -- To use the rail for -- to transport

sense, so they paralyzed for one week, a train, the rails, and whatever, to transport us, and
they did the same two month later to transport to Bergen-Belsen on April -- we arrive on
April 10%, and the British army, the 15". So it made no sense to send ou -- to send

we’re -- where we were last time were, to the British territory. It made no sense. So what

is the advantage to be liberated by the British instead of the Americans? So -- Or -- I --

Q: Can you describe the moment of liberation?

A: Yes. Th-The German there, the -- the HakenkreuzHaakenereise has been put by -- (Formatted: Font: Bold
put down, but you know, I was in a very bad, then I was 4indeeipherable}in very bad

health, and a couple of days are missing, so you know that I remember of the days, a

couple of days are missing, because very probably I was in a kind of coma, and instead of
| --[--1--I didn’t die, findecipherable]a had a big chance, because on perhaps the 10 (Formatted: Font: NotBold id

or the 11" of May, I asked a -- a ge -- a German soldier, who became prisoner in the

meantime, “How about the war?” And he said, “The war? The war is finished.” And then

I understood that I felt out for a -- a good couple of days.

Q: S-So you don’t remember the British soldiers coming in, and --

A: Yes, the British soldiers coming in, yes, but it happened later. The British soldiers

came on April 15", the end of the war on May eighth, and the -- and for me the 10° or

11", so something is miss -- something was missing, and then I gi -- went out and met
| people, they saidsays, “Oh, you are still alive.” We didn’t -- We -- We didn’t think that

he -- we are alive.

Q: What was that like when the -- can you just describe what it was like when the British

soldiers came in to Bergen-Belsen?

A: Yes, I think this is the HakenkreuzHaakenereise, and the fact that we realized

liberty was there, but the British -- not the British, nobody -- nobody knew how to handle
th-this kind of -- of -- of -- of living -- living death people, so you can imagine that i -- I -
- if -- if you lose 50 percent of your weight, approximately, how do you want to oblige
your stomach and your body to work? You couldn’t. And they gave fat and meat, and --
and plenty of things, they -- they gave what they had, but what they -- what they -- but
what they di -- they didn’t, couldn’t resolve, this -- this -- the -- the -- the health situation.
Q: What was wrong with you?
A: I thi -- I think that I had typhus, I think, because the typhus is provoked by -- what’s
the name of this small --
Q: Mosquito?
A: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Very small insects.
Q: An ant?
A: Hm? I -- I don’t know --

Q: Lice?
A: Yes, perhaps.
Q: Lice. In the hair?

A: Yes. And I didn’t realize, because I -- in Bergen — Dora, Bergendera-we were (Formatted: Font:Bold id
working -- I was really working on the weapon miracle of Hitler, the V1Fee — V2Vee (Formatted: Font: Bold sid
ene-+ee-tye. And I -- I wore these glass bands, glass tapes, and of course i-it provoked
my -- my [indecipherable}+vesvere. And I didn’t -- I didn’t realize that the position
between the glass and the -- and the insects. It was horrible. I -- Imagine one sh -- one
shirt you had 200 - 300. Well -- Well, so I think we could continue this conversation
eternally. I think the most important thing is that I don’t know if the Jewish are really the
chosen people, maybe. If it is -- If it is so, our experience concerns the huma -- hu -- the
entire humanity. This is not only a Jewish problem, because people are very inventive,
and new methods of killing will arrive. And I think that -- that we cannot be -- we cannot
| agree with Serge KlarsfeldKlassfeld, you know him, a very important journalist, and --
and especially of Holocaust and the -- and_ war criminals. I met him once in the air -- the
| air -- at the airport, and I told him who I was, that I was also in a concentration camp,
etcetera, and I see -- and I ask him, what do you think, w-wouldn’t it be better to -- to try
to share this experience with other people having the same conditions, or similar
conditions? And he said, “They have to find th-the right solution. This is our problem
now.” And I think not -- I don’t think that is our problem. I think that is of course our --
our problem, but if such a horror arrives to a -- to a people, and you see that something
similar, and more cynical arrived in Cambodia when the -- the head of the state started to
kill his own population, and -- and you -- we -- we see everywhere where we -- in hoot --
in Bu-Burundi, and the hoot -- Tutsies and Hutus and -- and the -- Kosovo, and

whatever. So I think that this experience should be -- must be strong enough to go over --
to let understand by other people, that these experience should serve to somehow --
somehow to immunize hum -- huma -- the whole humanity, to -- to try to think before
they -- they s -- they start such horrors. I think this is -- this must be the message of
