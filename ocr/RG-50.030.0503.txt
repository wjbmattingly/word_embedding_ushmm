went.
Q: And how did you or your husband know these people?
A: Can’t tell you. I don’t remember.

A: We went every day, we took a little bit out, you know, from the apartment. Clothes first, like I
would go to the cleaners, and then we started to take other things out, like silver, and so forth.
Q: I’m going to take a quick break. Okay, we were starting to talk about you beginning to go into
hiding, and I wanted to make sure I understood approximately when was this? How long after
the anschluss? Was it a year or two after, or -- or sooner than that? Do you -- did you go into
hiding in 1938, or was it later?
A: Later, later.
Q: Think it may have been closer to 1941, does that seem right?
A: I thinks that would be 1941, yeah.
Q: So, from 1938 to 1941, were things getting more and more difficult all the time?
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Q: And are there any examples that come to mind? What -- what sorts of things were happening?
A: Life became very complicated for us, you know? Everybody know when you went to the
street, you are a Jew, you know? And it was -- and we lost all our apartments, I told you that
already. We pushed together in small rooms. It was complicated, yeah.
Q: Were you actively trying to leave the country?
A: Oh yeah. I was supposed to go to Venezuela, I told you that.
Q: But after that didn’t work out, did you try other things?
A: Then you couldn’t go. We waited for papers who never came. You could leave if you have
the papers, but it never came.
Q: And then at some point you started looking into the option of going into hiding.
A: Yeah.
Q: And your husband was mostly in charge of looking for those arrangements?

A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: Now, you already told me a little bit about receiving some kind of order, a relocation order.
What did that say? What was the relocation order that you received?
A: I didn’t receive it. They started to -- people started to receive it. [indecipherable] my mother
too, I told you, to come with so and so much for relocation, and they went to Theresienstadt.
From there they came later to Auschwitz.
Q: I thought you said you and your husband also received a relocation order.
A: Then we went in hiding.
Q: So when you received your -- the relocation order, what did it say? How long did it give you
in order to relocate? Was it very short period of time?
A: I don’t remember.
Q: I guess what I’m curious to know is, did you have to go into hiding very quickly?
A: I think so. But we already knew, and we were prepared to do it.
Q: So does that mean you moved out of your apartment entirely?
A: Yeah. We left, yeah.
Q: So the first place you went into hiding in 1941, can you give a physical sort of description,
whatever your memory can recall.
A: There’s something. Wait a second. Yeah, Debbie’s little brother, was his 13"" birthday.
Debbie?

A2: [have a -- my brother is Howard.
Q: Ah yeah, that’s right. Her mother’s brother, yeah. I-I[gnatz. He was 13, and I said on that day,
you know, family should be together, so the grandparents they were in hiding already, and we
arranged they should come late in the evening while everybody goes home, and we will have a
little celebration. And they never came, because they were arrested in the morning.
Q: I think actually we -- we haven’t talked about this yet during the interview. Maybe you can
explain wh-who are these family members, or who are these friends you are referring to. Can you
tell me a little bit about your friends Ann and Ignatz?
A: My friend Ann?
Q: How did you meet them, or how long did you know them?
A: Well, when I saw her first, she was 13 -- Ann Green? You speak about her?
Q: Yes, because you started to talk about her brother, so I just wanted you to give a little
introduction to both of them.
A: So when I saw her the first time, she was 13, and her father was what we call a person -- they
came from a small town to Vienna, they were relocated, and he could do everything. You want to
sell, he knew who buys. You want to buy, he knew who will sell. So what we needed was
money, and he knew somebody who would borrow money for a lot of interest. We couldn’t get

our money from some reason or the other. And there I met Annie the first time, Ann Green. And
his -- her little brother, yeah.
Q: So when you first went into hiding with your husband, were you also in hiding with Ann and
her brother?
A: No. When I went to hiding -- I wonder if her brother went with us, I wish I could remember.
Q: It’s okay. Can you --
A: The 19" of May.
Q: What was the 19" of May?
A: Was his -- her brother’s birthday.
Q: And what happened on that day?
A: I wanted a -- we should be all together, but her parents never came because they were arrested
in the morning.
Q: And did you know that? Did everybody know that?
A: No, no, we did not know. They didn’t show up. So later in the evening, somebody called, and
said they are arrested.
Q: And how did you deal with this news?
A: Beg your pardon?
Q: How did you cope? How did you deal with this news?
A: Well, was very hard. Her brother started to yell, and to cry. And I said, please be quiet,
somebody would -- could hear us. And Annie went to -- Ann Green, she went to calm him down.
Was very bad. It was very bad.

Q: Were you already in hiding with your husband?
A: Yeah, yeah. We knew already. We were in hiding and Bushie was with us. Ignatz was -- was
with us. Annie came later. Mrs. Green, she was someplace else, she came later.
Q: Tell me about the conditions of this hiding place. Did you have a lot of space, or a very little
bit of space? What were the conditions like?
A: It’s -- was a [indecipherable] laundry, and they had a wooden, little house. Was small, but it
has electricity. It was a outhouse, you know, no toilet in the house. But it was all right, we
managed. We were hiding it. We did feel a little bit secure, you know?
Q: How many of you were in that outhouse?
A: Outhouse, no, not outhouse.
Q: In -- in the outhouse, you said.
A: Outhouse was the toilet.
Q: Sorry, in this little building, right?
A: In the building. So who was there? My husband, I, and [indecipherable] then Annie came, we
were four.
Q: Were you all sleeping in one room?
A: I don’t think so. Could be, I don’t remember.
Q: And where did you go to the bathroom, it was close by?
A: It was outside in the garden. We had to go outside.
Q: And you said there was an outhouse, or you just went outside and went to the bathroom
outdoors.

Q: And what did you do for food back there?
A: For food, well you had to get it. And we bought it. We had to take -- we knew somebody, she
could get everything. But if you needed sugar, you had to take some chickens, otherwise she
didn’t give it to you. She was very funny. She always said, I’m very good to you, am I? But she
never woulds give us anything, [indecipherable] anything if you wouldn’t have taken something
else what you did not need. But she could get everything from the market.
Q: And was this woman Jewish, or not Jewish?
A: No, not Jewish.
Q: So she was helping you, she knew that you were in hiding?
A: Yeah, yeah, she knew.
Q: Were there a number of non-Jewish people helping you?
A: Yeah, there were two girls, they had -- they had some land and they grow vegetable, th --
everything. We got everything from them. And they knew. They didn't say it, but they knew.
Q: They knew that you were in hiding?
A: Yeah, I know. One of this -- one name was -- I remember one name, Fishbach. The second
name I don’t remember. They knew, because they did give us everything. Before they go to --

told him, because he started to ask money. He -- he started to stick -- tell my husband that he
needs money to buy wood, you know? Yeah, he started to ask money for th -- us.
Q: So what did you do?
A: Well, we did give it to him, but he never stopped, and it was a lot of money, you know, for
Jewish people. He got the money for us if he will denounce us. And somehow he -- he must have
done it.
Q: He must have done what?
A: To denounce us. To tell that we are there.
Q: You think he’s the reason you were found?
A: Yeah. I think so.
Q: But the -- but the woman was very good to you?
A: Yeah, we were -- but he did -- we had to from time to time to other place, which we did, you
know? And then she -- they called us back, and we came back, let’s see, around five o’clock,
when everybody was in the street going home from work. Was five o’clock in the evening. Four
o’clock in the morning the Gestapo came, and we were arrested.
Q: Now, before I ask you about -- about that time, I just want to try to capture more details while
you were actually still in hiding. Why -- why did you leave -- is her name Pukas -- Pukas? Why
did you leave, from time to time, from her hiding place?
A: We had to, yeah. That was the arrangement.
Q: She told you you would need to leave?
A: That was the arrangement from the beginning.

we didn’t know them. He was a tiny little man, [indecipherable] was his name, married to a
Jewish lady, and they took us in. We went to them.
Q: Did you go to other hiding places as well?
A: No, only those two.
Q: Only those two, so this -- this one couple, or the woman who --

A: Yeah -- no, no, at the woman place.
Q: Did you do any work while you were staying with her?
A: Yeah, ironing. Oh yeah.
Q: Now, tell me how you were feeling? Every day were you worried and afraid, or what was
your feeling at the time?
A: We were always worried, but we had the children and we had school. They didn’t know
anything. They couldn’t read, they couldn’t write, they had no schooling at all. Every afternoon -
- no, every evening -- in the afternoon we ironed, and in the evening we had school. They
learned to write, to read, whatever we could ba -- husband was very highly educated, and he is --
whatever we could, you know? We taught them, of course.

A: And she was -- she is 15 years, she was born 1925. She was 15 years younger than I.
Q: So every night you became a teacher?
A: Yeah.
Q: So do you feel like during this time in hiding, were there also times where things were not as,
you know, heavy and worrisome? Did you have any lighter moments?
A: No. We were worried all the time. You know, you -- you are not worried all the time, that’s
impossible. You forget yourself. But w-we were not really peaceful, no. We were hopeful. That’s
different. And we always made it, you know.
Q: Were there any humorous stories while you were in hiding?
A: Oh yeah. Two, yeah, yeah.
Q: Can you tell me about those?
A: Well, you know, when she wanted something, Pukas, we have to give it to her. She did not
stop. So it was a holy day and she wanted a goose. And finally we got the goose, but we had to
pick it up by the [indecipherable] station. There was a stand for papers and cigarettes, and she
had the goose. And we had to go there, was very dangerous. Debbie’s mother and I, we went
there, a-and there was the goose, I had the canvas bag, and the goose went in that canvas bag,
and there were Gestapo and gendarmes, but we finally made it, and we left. And there was a dog
[indecipherable] after that, he smelled the blood in that canvas bag, and we were running to the
streetcar, and we finally made it. You know, we were so afraid of that dog, that somebody will
notice it. That was very funny. When we came home, and Annie got undressed, she had a blue
sweater. Her skin was all blue. Was not -- at that time, nothing was colorfast, like today.
Q: At the time now you’re -- you’re laughing about it, but were you very worried at that time?

A: No. Oh God.
Q: So you were trying to pass as non-Jewish?

Q: Did anyone ever talk to you and say anything to you, and indicate that they thought you were
Jewish?

Beginning Tape Two Side A
Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne Windholm,
conducted by Amy Rubin on November 18, 2005, in Manhattan, New York. This is tape number
two, side A. Okay, I’m going to continue asking you a little more about your time in hiding. And
I’m wondering, during this entire time, I have the impression that you first went into hiding in
1941?
A: Yeah.
Q: And -- and you were s -- you stayed in hiding until 1944. So a lot was happening during this
time, and I’m wondering what did you know about the war, and what was going on.
A: We knew everything. We listened to the British sender at night, I told you. We do -- we knew
that attentat which, you know, there was supposed to be attentat of Hitler? You know that?
Q: Say that again? There was supposed to be?
A: Yeah, attentat? He was supposed to be killed.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And that -- somehow we knew that will happen, but it did not.
Q: So while -- I -- I knew that you were listening to the radio before you went into hiding, but
even while you were in hiding, you still listened?
A: Yeah.
Q: And was that -- you listened right in that little building?
A: Yeah. We had the radio, yeah.
Q: So what were your conversations mostly about while you were in hiding? Did you talk
primarily about the war?

A: That I should remember. Of course. We spoke about the war, we spoke about what happened,
how we did live. We spoke about what will happen. Then we had the children, who didn’t learn
anything, so we had school every day.
Q: Did you feel like you were becoming a -- a sort of mother to these children? You were taking
care of them.
A: Well, I f -- I did feel very near to them. They boy was very young, you know, of course, and
Annie was 15 years younger than I, so -- so Annie, I were more a friend than a mother. But to her
little brother, I did feel like a mother, yeah.
Q: Did you ever talk about sort of strategies about how you were trying to survive this entire
time? You know, walking out on the streets, did you have strategies where you would go, how
you would walk?
A: L only noticed one thing. When I was liberated by the Russians, you know that -- you know I
was liberated by the Russians?
Q: Right.
A: That Ic -- noticed that I was afraid to go on the walk part. I was going on the street, til I said
to myself, are you crazy, you’re free. You know?
Q: Are you saying you didn’t want to walk on the sidewalk?
A: Yeah, I was afraid, like I’m not allowed to.
Q: Because that’s how it was in Vienna?
A: That how I did feel.
Q: So as you walked around Vienna, when you would come out of hiding from time to time, how
did the city feel to you? What were the differences? How did it change?
A: I didn’t feel -- I wasn’t tired of being in Vienna. I was in Krakow, in Poland.

Q: No, I’m talking about while you were in hiding. Weren’t you s -- in Vienna the entire time?
A: Yeah, I was in -- always inside [indecipherable]
Q: So how did the city change during those war years? Did it feel like a different city to you?
A: No. In later years, when I was living in Italy, and I came back to Vienna, everything looked to
me so dirty, so broken down. That was later on.
Q: Well, what about air raids during the war? Did you experience those in Vienna?
A: When the air raid we -- well, when we were hiding by those people [indecipherable] when the
air raid came, everybody had to go to the basement. And their apartment was in the fifth floor,
and we went up to the attic to hide. And there, Bushie, he was afraid of the little mice. Oh God,
he -- yeah, we did hid in the attic til the air raid was over.
Q: And you’re saying there were mice in the attic?
A: Yeah, there were mice, yeah. And Bushie was so afraid of them, terrible.
Q: Were you afraid too?
A: No. Of little mice? I don’t want them in my apartment.
Q: Now, I think I heard another story, and I’m not sure exactly the details, but something about a
man and the bathtub, the water in the bathtub. Is that a story that you remember while you were
in hiding? I think it was a man who drank the water.
A: That’s not me.
Q: Okay, I -- I guess I misunderstood something I think Deborah was telling me, but maybe I just
got it wrong. So that doesn’t sound familiar to you?
A: Absolutely not.

Q: Did you have any other people who came and joined you during hiding, or was only the four
of you at all times?
A: Only the four of us.
Q: And did you feel like you always trusted this woman who was keeping you in hiding?
A: Yeah. Only her boyfriend, he needed money, he started to ask money. We were afraid of him.
And that what -- how it happened.
Q: So while you were working in this laundry, did you have to make sure that nobody else would
see you? How difficult was that? People in the neighborhood, were you worried about that?
A: There were next to us, thi -- there were -- this was a cottage, you know, and there were private
houses. And there were people we knew. I don’t know if they had the -- maybe they had some
idea, but there was no danger.
Q: Tell me a little bit about your training to become a nurse, I believe.
A: Yeah. There was a doctor, Dr. Richard Miller. I was already liberated then, and he trained me,
because that Roosevelt Hospital in Vienna was not a hospital, it was a orphanlager. There were
people living -- children without parents, parents without children, the [indecipherable] was
bumped, and he trained me. Dr. Otto Vulcan, he trained me, to become a nurse, yeah.
Q: So this is -- this is much later, this is after the end of the war?
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: Now, while you’re in hiding, what were some of the dreams or hopes? What were you hoping
would happen, that you would still leave the country?

A: I don’t think I wanted to leave the country. I wanted to be free.
Q: So while you were in hiding, were there any other -- did you just think you would stay in
hiding the entire time of the war? Was that your strategy and your hope?
A: My hope was yeah, that it will not take a long time.
Q: Now tell me about the day when -- when they came and found you where you were in hiding.
What -- what exactly happened?
A: We were away -- you know, I told you, from time to time we had to go away to stay with
other people. They called us we should come back. We came back around five o’clock in the
evening, when everybody was in the street. At four o’clock in the morning the Gestapo came,
and we were arrested.
Q: Do you have any idea about who -- who told the Gestapo that you were there?
A: I think her boyfriend, who always ask for money.
Q: And you think this woman agreed to let him do that?
A: I don’t think she knew.
Q: So, as much as you can remember the details, what exactly happened when you got arrested?
A: Well, we went to jail. And there was already a lot of women who waited to be tr-transported
to Auschwitz, but they were in quarantine. There was some sickness. So Mrs. Green and I, we
were outside, and we did work. We cleaned the floors. Then the -- they did give us bread. We
had to distribute that bread between people. And we did work there, and we were living in the
open place.
Q: Now where was that?
A: It was [indecipherable] in jail, in Vienna.

A: We were in jail, but we were not locked up. We could go out. Not out on the street. You
know, the people are locked in, we were not locked in. We could move around on the floor.
Q: And what were you thinking during this time period?
A: Well, I was very unhappy that they caught us.
Q: Did you know what would happen next?
A: Oh yeah. I knew. We knew.
Q: You knew specifically that you would be sent to Auschwitz? Or perhaps to somewhere else?
A: No, we -- to a concentration camp, I did not know Auschwitz. To a concentration camp.
Q: So while you were in jail, you felt there was nothing you could do about it, you just had to
wait?

A: Yeah. The war was almost over.
Q: So what happened next when you -- when you were then deported? Tell me as many of the
details as you can remember.

Olga [indecipherable]. Wait a second. Two, four, six. Let me think again, [indecipherable] Olga
[indecipherable], her husband Otto, and I, Annie, Bushie. We were seven people, who were
arrested. And we were in jail in Vienna til we went that transport.
Q: What do you remember about the day when you were deported from the jail?
A: Well, it -- there was still -- was a Jewish community, and they did bring us, I remember
everybody did get a little bread in the [indecipherable]. They came to the [indecipherable]

A: No. I know we are going to a concentration camp.
Q: But you got on the train and you didn’t know where, exactly.
A: No, no. We went to Birkenau. Auschwitz was for men, and Birkenau was for women.
Q: And when did you know that you were going there? Only when you arrived, or right before?
A: Well, we knew we go to a concentration camp.
Q: So how long did the trip take, the transport?
A: We had to change trains and all that. Did take a very long time. Hours, maybe.
Q: Were you uncomfortable on that ride, or just --
A: Frightened, yeah.
Q: Just frightened. And what were your first impressions upon arriving to Auschwitz?
A: Well, there was Mengele sitting, and then they made selections. My husband went here, I
went there. And I said I want to go with my husband, and he said to me, be happy you’re not
going. And my husband, his color in his face became gray. He knew. And I think I only touched
his hand, I don’t remember. He knew, yeah.

A: Yeah.
Q: And when did you learn what -- what actually happened, or did you not even learn anything

Q: How were you able to -- to go on after that?
A: Well, if you in a concentration camp, you learn everything. You learn to survive. You learn to
steal, you know? You tried everything to stay alive. You saw something, and you looked around,

maybe I could find some potato peels. There were none, but they took already breakfast for the

[indecipherable] the end, and I -- I took some out. They couldn’t help it. I had two breakfasts.
Yo-You tried everything. You never knew, should you eat your bread? Should you keep a piece
for the morning, they will steal it. And we worked very hard. Look on my hand. That was one SS
woman did to me. She did hold her foot, when we went one, two, three, four and I fell, and she
stepped on my hand.

A: Beg your pardon?
Q: What happened again? You were trying to reach for some food? What happened with this SS

A: Yeah.
Q: And do you remember, did you go through the showers? What -- what sort of process did they

hair, they cut it. Then they tattooed us, you know that. And then we went to the shower, took all
our clothes, and I had very good shoes, platform shoes. There was a man, one of the prisoners,
we have to give everything to him. I said to him, you are from Vienna, I knew him. Let me keep
my shoes. And he told me, [indecipherable] you know what means [indecipherable]
Q: No.
A: You say [indecipherable] if somebody dies, but not if a human being dies, you know? Ifa
animal dies, [indecipherable], you aren’t a -- you [indecipherable]. Then I knew where I am. I
knew him, but when he said that to me, then I know. Oh yeah.

Q: And he was -- he was one of the Jewish prisoners, is that right?
A: Yeah, sure.
Q: Did you see a lot of Jewish prisoners being very mean to other Jewish prisoners?
A: I can’t tell you that. Everybody tried very hard. Next to us was a Polish block, there were all
Polish girls, and I had no shoes. You know what I had? Those wooden clogs, like the Holland.
You know wa -- how they are?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So that’s -- I couldn’t walk in them, I was [indecipherable] like that. One of the Polish girls
did bring me a pair of shoes, high up to here, yeah? She saw me, and she got packages from
home, they were mostly politish. They were good.
Q: So in your -- in your barracks, was it mostly other Jewish women from Austria, or was it a
real combination of different --
A: A combina -- you heard it in the evening. The Italian’s sung, mama so dante felice. Mother, I
only will be happy if I will be -- if I will be returning to you. The Greeks sung the old song in the
evening, which I could not understand. It kept them alive, I suppose.
Q: And they were allowed to sing? Nobody was keeping them from doing that?
A: I suppose not.
Q: So you must have been around a lot of women you couldn’t even speak with because of the
languages.
A: Oh yeah.
Q: Were there other women there who spoke German? You could communicate?
A: I was -- yeah, with Germans, yeah. They called me delonger deutsch, the tall German.

A: Yeah.
Q: Did you still feel like you were taking care of her, looking out for her?
A: Yeah, yeah. She never wanted to wash, because when we came back from work, you opened,
no water, drops. I wake up one night, and there were two girls [indecipherable] from our barrack,
which [indecipherable]. So I said, oh God, where are they going? I run after them, and there was
so much water in the washrooms, flowing, you know? Then I woke up every night, we went
there, and we washed each other’s back from top to bottom. We had no towel to dry, I said it
doesn’t matter. Because if you had the selections, one pimple on your body, you went. We were
afraid, you know, of sicknesses. We were a very cheap labor force, didn’t cost a penny.
Q: So it sounds like you tried very hard to stay clean all the time.
A: Oh yeah. I knew that if -- if you are clean, you had a chance. I told her that, yeah. She had --
she showed me in the panties she got, there was a -- a -- a louse. I said to her, “Listen Annie, if I
will kill your lice, I will not be able to take care of my lice. You will not live if I will not live. So
you take care of yours, I of mine, and just do what I tell you, then maybe we have a chance.”
Q: Were these the kind of conversations you would have almost every day?
A: No, no, no, no. We tried very hard. We worked very hard.
Q: Was there any part of normal life that was able to continue, or not?
A: Where?
Q: In Auschwitz.
A: We worked s-six and a half days. Sunday afternoon we were free. Sunday afternoon we could
take care of ourself.

A: Well, we washed, we cleaned ourself. We go and look if we find somebody you knew from
home. You slept.
Q: What kind of work were you doing?
A: Well, first -- that first work I did, stones like that we have to clean, and from one place we did
bring it to a other place. And there were the bloodhounds behind us, we have to run with the
heavy stones, then we have to take the back. It was just something to make us tired, nothing else.
There was n-n-no -- nothing what has any sense. And then I -- then we made [indecipherable] to
clean the pavement. And then I did something, I was standing in water, I don’t remember what I
did.
Q: You mean, some kind of job you had standing in water?

Beginning Tape Two, Side B

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Marianne Windholm. This is tape two, side B. Okay, I think there are a couple stories while you
were in Auschwitz that I’d be interested in learning more about. I think there’s a story that has
something to do with potatoes. Can you tell me more about that?
A: Yeah. What happened is, when we get 0 -- got our soup in the evening, I said to that person
who did give the soup, why don’t you give me some soup from the bottom, where there are
potatoes, a little vegetable, maybe a piece of meat. And she said to me s-something very bad, and
thens give me from top a little water, so I threw it in her face. So next day was the day when you
went to work, you got instead one potatoes, two potatoes. So he said, you are not going to work,

I will show you. So I didn’t go to work. But somebody has to go to pick up the potatoes. So they
did send four girls from our block to go to pick up the potatoes. So we heard potatoes, we went
to the ba -- big, beautiful potatoes, we did [indecipherable] I took the potatoes, one there, one
there, and here. Four potatoes already. And then we came to my block, and we had to put that
down, had two potatoes, put them under my mattress, under the mattress from my neighbor, and
then we stood appelle and then [indecipherable] then I have potatoes, and we had so much
potatoes, we ate and ate and ate. She said I will not get any, so I got maybe 10.
Q: And that was very unusual, right?
A: Oh God. Oh God.
Q: Now where did you put these potatoes, since we’re doing only an audio recording, I know
you showed me visually, but where did you keep these potatoes?
A: Two I put in here, two I put in here, inside.
Q: You’re talking about under your arms, right?
A: Yeah, inside.
Q: Inside your blouse -- inside your shirt.
A: Yeah, and then the others I put under my mattress.
Q: So were you not as hungry during those days with the potatoes?
A: No, that was a day where I was very happy, yeah. I had potatoes not only for me, for my
friends, too. Who could eat so many potatoes?
Q: When you were working, were you working side by side with your friend, Ann?
A: No.
Q: She was somewhere else?
A: She was someplace else.

Q: Now, there’s another story, I think, about one of your socks. You had something special in
one of your socks?
A: Yeah, I g -- we got once a month different clothes. We went to [indecipherable] we got
different clothes. And I have two pair of socks. The hurt -- one sock hurt me terribly, but I
couldn’t help it, I had to wear it til Sunday, til I’m off, Sunday afternoon. Then I open it, and
there was a golden cross with a golden chain. And it says, Luigi and the name, Italian name,
August the 26". Now I have to find somebody where I could exchange that golden cross for
food. Finally I did find, was far away, I had to run there, I got 20 soups, 20 days I could go for
soup. But it was very far. Had to run like crazy to make the curfew.
Q: What was the curfew, what time? Was it early, pretty early?
A: Yeah, it was early, yeah.
Q: But you would not have gotten in trouble for being out before the curfew and running over
there, to the other area?
A: No. The curfew have to be inside.
Q: And how did you get these 20 soups? You would go back to somewhere in ke -- you got
soups every day?
A: Yeah, every day I run there for soup.
Q: It sounds like you were pretty resourceful during this difficult time. Do you feel that you
were?
A: Well, I tried. We all tried to survive.
Q: Do you think being resourceful like that you were able to eat more and stay stronger?
A: To eat more?

Q: It sounds like you were able to get more food at certain times, and maybe that kept you
stronger.
A: Well, I only know when I was liberated, I had 90 pounds.
Q: And how much did you usually weigh?
A: At that time, 135 - 136.
Q: So you were extremely weak?
A: Oh, I was very weak. And they called me musselman, that’s people [indecipherable] and
bones, bones and skin.
Q: Now did you -- did you observe any -- any sort of religious observances during this time in
Auschwitz, privately, or did you pray at all?
A: No, no, no, no.
Q: Did you regard yourself as a religious person?
A: Well, if you -- you could feel religious without praying, I suppose. Don’t you think so?
Q: Yes, I think so. Did you feel that you had a belief in God during this time?
A: I don’t think that I said God will help. Help yourself.
Q: Did you ever let your emotions really get to you during this time in Auschwitz, or did you just
try to stay so strong emotionally?
A: That’s what I tried, yeah. It was Yom Kippur, and they said, now you have the holiday, you
don’t have -- you don’t need any food today, it’s your fast day. Didn’t give us anything to eat,
Yom Kippur.
Q: But you didn’t have to work that day, or did they make you work?

Q: Did you have any nightmares during this time? Was it just every night, how did you sleep?
A: I can’t tell you that. I was so tired, I suppose I slept.
Q: And when they did the appelle, the roll call, what was that like?
A: To stay in appelle.
Q: Were you scared about being selected and taken away?
A: Well, that was something else. This was not the roll call, this was the selection. You were
afraid to have a pimple on your body, because they were afraid of sicknesses. So if you had a
pimple on your body, then you are dead already.
Q: Did you see a lot of people being selected?
A: I can’t remember that.
Q: Did you ever witness anything very violent, any -- any killings while you were there?
A: Yeah, one Belgian girl escaped, and they did find her, and she was hanged. And we had all to
stay and watch how she was hanged.
Q: Did you think a lot about the possibility of death during this time, or did you try to avoid
those thoughts?
A: IL beg your pardon?
Q: Did you try to avoid thoughts about death, or did you think about death?
A: No. I tried to survive. I didn’t think about death, no. Only that water you know, when we
came from work, they said not to drink, dysentery of the water, you know, in the washrooms. So
I said to myself, I will die anyway, why should I die hungry? I will have -- at least I will have
something to drink. I drank the water, nothing happened to me, I didn’t get dysentery, nothing.
So I came from work and I drank.

the rain were the tears from the -- his eyes. He was crying. And he did give me some vodka,
whatever. He tried to bring me back to life. And he cried so terribly.

sometimes?

on the tip of the toe. And she married there somebody by name of Jacoba Cohen. And I had no
idea, of course.

daughter, and she was very ill. And her daughter came to me and said, my mother wants to speak
with you. And she was laying on the floor, and she s -- was dying. And she said to me, promise
me that you take care of Ilse, of her daughter, a young girl, she was maybe 12 years old, and her
name was Freedbig. She died, and I closed her eyes. I promised I’d take her with me. So she was
crying all the time. I couldn’t help myself. There was a little church, and I said to her, “Ilse, I
take you to the church.” She was Catholic. She never knew she’s Jewish. So I took her there, and
there was a little priest -- a little -- a young priest, and s -- he consoled her, and he prayed with

noises or smells that remind you?

Q: So maybe 34, something --
A: Something, yeah.
Q: How did the -- how did the Russians treat you?
A: The Russians? Well, they had nothing to eat, only potatoes and kraut. And that one doctor
was a Jew, he spoke Jewish. And I told him, how could you give us kraut? Potatoes all right, but
we can’t eat sauerkraut. He said, we have a saying, whoever is strong will live, and who is weak
will die. And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia. And then took -- there were three
sisters, they told me, we are going away, because we are afraid of being taken to Russia. You
come with us? I said yes. They spoke Polish, and German, and maybe Russian, I don’t know.
And we left. We went over the Carpath -- over the mountains, oh God.
Q: Was that a difficult journey?

Beginning Tape Three, Side A
Q: This is part two of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne
Windholm, conducted by Amy Rubin on December third, 2005, in Manhattan, New York. This
is tape number three, side A. Okay, so we’re going to continue with the interview, and I’d just
like to ask you a few es -- about a few specific stories, a few anecdotes, and I have a little list
here, so I’m just going to ask you a few, and then you can tell me what you remember about
these stories.
A: Okay.
Q: One of them is something to do with your father coming home from the war, and I’m
presuming that’s World War |, right?
A: That was World War I, yeah. We didn’t let him in.
Q: Well, tell me about that.
A: Well, at that time, you know, in the morning, everybody run to get some food, or coal,
because you couldn’t get anything. So we children were by ourself at home, and we were not
allowed to open the door to anybody. But we had a little window, with a little [indecipherable]
and somebody was ringing the bell, so we went up, opened it to look out, there was a man. He
looked like a forester. And he said, “Marianne, open the door, I am your father.” And I looked at
him, I said, “I don’t know you.” But I am your father, don’t you know? Then I said to my b-
brother Paul, he is the -- he was the oldest, “There’s a man, he says he’s our father.” He went up,
he looked at him, we don’t know you. Open the door. We didn’t open the door. We didn’t let
him in. Then finally my mother came, and then of course, there were only happiness. They were
dancing and kissing outside, yeah. He’d come home from the war, yeah. Dif --

A: Oh, I must have been maybe six, maybe five.
Q: And did you not recognize your father?
A: No, no. I didn't see him for years. I didn’t recognize him. But my brother recognized him
because he laughed and he had the golden tooth. And my brother saw that golden tooth. And he
said to me, “It’s our father.” How do you know? He has a golden tooth. But he didn’t let him in,
because Mother did forbid it.
Q: Now there’s another little anecdote I wanted to ask you about, and it --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- something to do with the theater.
A: With what?
Q: With the theater -- with the theater.
A: Theater?
Q: Yes.
A: Yeah? Well, there was a [indecipherable] coming in from -- I don’t know from where. It was
a Jewish theater, and my parents went and saw it. The Golem was the name. And they decided
that we children are big enough to see it. So -- not my sister, my little sister, no. My brother who
was older than I, and myself and two cousins of us. And they took a loge for us children and our
maid did bring us there. And we were sitting there, and then it started and somebody came out
and said, in Jewish, which were -- we were not used to, we never spoke it. He said -- I'll have to
translate it, so y-you don’t know Jewish, yeah?
Q: Well, why don’t you say it first in Yiddish, and then you can translate it.
A: Yeah. [speaks Yiddish here] So that means, big Jewish king, we are coming to tell you and to
let you know -- and when they started to tell you and to let you know, we started to laugh

terribly. So next moment they took us out one after the other, and we had to stay outside, and
wait til our maid came to pick us up. When the the -- theater was over, they just threw us out.
Q: They threw you out of the theater?
A: Of the theater, yeah. One after the other. Took us under their arm, out.
Q: But why, why did they do that?
A: Because we started laughing.
Q: So these are some of the fond memories you have from Vienna?
A: Yeah. Not only, you know, from childhood I have other memories, too. Yeah, yeah.
Q: What about the anecdote about Mother’s day?
A: Oh poor Mother, we didn’t let her go out of bed. How do you know about it?
Q: Well these are some of the stories that Mazie encouraged me to ask you.
A: Uh-huh. Yeah, well it was Mother’s day, so we ha -- didn’t have money, we were children,
but in the -- before Mother’s day, my sister and I, we did [indecipherable] and my brother picked
from the tree, flowers. Lilac. And s -- then was Mother’s day and we made breakfast, and we
didn’t let her go out of bed. And she had to go out so urgent, which is normal, but we didn’t let
her. She had to stay in bed and have breakfast which we made, in bed. That was the Mother’s
day story.
Q: Did she enjoy it?
A: I don’t think so, she had to go pee. Very urgent. We didn’t let her.
Q: Well, it sounds like you had a lot of good fun and good memories in your home.
A: Oh yeah. Yeah, well, I really do, yeah. It was a fo -- but I was a orphan at a very young age,
you know.

Q: There’s another story, I believe about your mother, a humorous story, something about don’t
give her away?
A: Uh-huh, uh-huh. My father passed away, you know, and I was in the street. And I was
walking, and I saw a man from the back. He was dressed exactly like my father. Blue jacket up
to here with the fur collar, funny little hat. And I started to run, and then I remember that he is
dead. And I stopped and started to cry terribly. And a lady came, and said to me, “Child, why are
you crying so much?” And I said, “My father is dead, my father is dead,” and started terrible
crying. So she said, “Okay, where do you live? Come on, I’Il take you home.” She took me home
and sh -- then she told my mother she wants me to come to Italy, she was a Italian. She has two
little boys and they will be very happy to have a little sister. And my mother could take with me
there to see if she likes it. If she doesn’t like it, it’s all right. We have horses, she will learn to
ride. My boys will be -- adore her. And m-my brother and my sister started to yell, “Mother,
please, don’t give her away, don’t give her away.” So that’s the story from Italy.
Q: Were you interested in going?
A: I can’t tell you that. If 1 would have gone, or if I was interested. I wouldn’t even remember.
But I remember the sto -- like they started to yell that they shouldn’t give me -- my mother
shouldn’t give me away. Don’t give her away.
Q: Now, what about another anecdote about when your mother was sick, and you had to cook?
A: Oh God. My mother became ill, and had to lay down. She has a gall bladder attack. And she
said to me, Marianne, you have to finish -- we ate lunch, the big meal, you know? Then the water
cooks, then you put the -- I forgot her -- the -- in English, whatever it is in the boiling water. So
then I took a spoon with water, and I came into her bedroom and ask her if that water is cooking.
I never knew because I never cooked. I never knew how it looks when water cooks.

Q: How old were you? Were you very young?
A: I must have been very young, and I can’t remember where -- where our maid was, yeah.
Q: Tell me a little bit about your maid, were you close to her?
A: Very close. We adored her, we were fa -- we were not afraid of our parents, oh no, we were
afraid of her. She was -- oh God. When we came in and our shoes were not clean, we got it. She
had a [indecipherable] she just went over our legs, oh yeah. And we adored her. And we were
afraid of her, yeah, but we loved her yeah, yeah.
Q: What was her name?
A: Marie.
Q: And she stayed with you for a long time?
A: Oh, a very long time. My mother got her when she got married. She stayed with us for a very
long time, and then she met somebody someplace, a landowner, very, very wealthy, and they got
married. And we spend the summer with her, because she c-came and asked my mother, please
send the children. And we sp -- did spend the whole summer with them, yeah.
Q: So your family was pretty well off financially, to have a maid?
A: Yeah, in the beginning, sure. As long as my father was alive, yeah.
Q: Now, I believe there’s another story here. Maybe you already told me the one about boiling
the water, but what about baking the chicken?
A: Beg your pardon?
Q: Baking the chicken. Mazie said there was a story you wanted to share about baking chicken,
no?
A: Baking chicken?

A: No.
Q: Okay. And what about another -- this is the final anecdote I wanted to ask you about. Your
first doll, and your brother did something with it.
A: Yeah, they opened her head. I had had a beautiful doll. When you pushed her belly button,
she said Mama, and when you laid her down she closes her eyes. And it was a big doll like that.
And my brother and my cousins couldn't understand why she closes her eyes, so they opened her
head, yeah. And that poor doll, she had to go to the hospital. Yeah, she was very sick. It was
terrible.
Q: You took her to the doll hospital?
A: Not me. Not me, no, my parents, my mother and my father, whoever did take her to a place to
be repaired. They cut the head open.
Q: Were you very upset, as a child?
A: I cou -- oh [indecipherable] I cried. Of course I was upset. It was a beautiful doll, she would
s-say Mama. She spoke, yeah. At that time, you know, I got it for -- my father did bring it from I
don’t know where. It was a beautiful, beautiful doll. Had hair, everything, yeah.
Q: And it was probably unusual to have a doll that spoke at that time.
A: Yeah sure. She only said Mama, but she said Mama. But you have to push her belly button.
Q: Well, thank you for sharing those stories. Now, I want to ask you some more questions that I
had here, prepared. And I wanted to make sure because I -- I don’t remember from our first
session together, can you just make sure to tell me your husband’s name?
A: Seno.
Q: Ah well, I know you were married twice --

Q: -- but your first husband.
A: Yeah, my first husband was Otto Brower.
Q: And so that became your last name for awhile as well?
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: Now, I wanted to return where we left off in our interview. We were talk -- we were starting
to talk about the time of liberation at Auschwitz.
A: Yeah.
Q: But I wanted to make sure that I had a -- some information even before we got to that point. I
don’t know if you know this by heart, or if we could somehow put this in the interview, but do
you know the -- the registration number, the tattoo number that they gave to you?
A: Well, you know, I -- I know 60 - 65 - 85 A -- I think so.
Q: Okay, it looks like A7 -- it’s hard to read, but maybe another two.
A: 75 -- 72?
Q: I think it’s 72, and then maybe a 25.
A: 72 - 25.
Q: Does that sound --
A: That sounds --
Q: -- familiar?
A: Yeah.

Q: Well, thank you for showing me. Now, when you were in Auschwitz, did you and others
around you, did you ever have any kind of religious observance? Did you try in any way to -- to
observe --
A: No, no. Only to Yom Kippur, they didn’t give us any food. They said that this here the day
where you fast anyways, you don’t -- so you don’t need any food.
Q: And that must have been very difficult in the conditions you were in. Now -- now tell me
more about liberation. If you can sort of walk me through that time period, what you remember,
and sort of set up the scene for me, what -- what exactly happened?
A: I was sick. I was very sick. I had a mer -- an infection in my right leg, and I have very high
temperature, and it was very dangerous to go to the revere. That revere was the s-s-sick station,
where sick people went, because they made selections there, you know, and killed people. But I
had no other choice. I was very, very ill. And it happened that I was absent mind, I know that.
And then, I remember only that it was raining and I did feel the drops from the rain on my face.
And I opened the eyes, and there I saw a man with the sickle and the hammer, was a Russian
soldier. He held me in his arms, and it wasn’t raining, he was crying terribly. That when we -- I
was -- when we were liberated. And the gates were open, people went out, you know.
Q: What was the next thing that you did?
A: Next thing? I was there for a long time. I actually couldn’t go. Then finally I became well
enough. And there were three sisters. They spoke German and Polish and Russian. And they
saids to that -- no, there came a rus -- Russian man, and they said they will take us to Russia to --
to get well again. And there were three sisters, they told me, we are not going with them. You
want to come with us? We are going home. They were from Seidenbergen, well a -- this a tar --
part of Europe. And so I went with them, and we went over the mountains, oh it was terrible. It

was March, was snowing, cold, but we went, oh yeah. Took us days and days, til we came
someplace, and that was dangerous. We slept on the street, like where the -- you know, the --
where the bus station is, there was little houses where I could stay and wait for the bus. And
there a man did find us, and he said, “Are you crazy? They are looking for Jewish people. If they
find you, they kill you.” And he took us to a place where we were safe, yeah.
Q: How did you travel over those snowy areas, the mountains?
A: By foot. Later on by coal [indecipherable] the tickets, were train with coal, so we were sitting
on the coal, and went with the train. You could go wherever you want. You didn’t need any
passport, any nothing at that time.
Q: First of all, at the time of liberation, what was your feeling, what were your emotions? Was it
hard to believe that this was happening?
A: Beg your pardon?
Q: Was it hard to believe that liberation was really happening when it happened? What were
your emotions at the time?
A: Well, I was relieved, I would say. I was happy. And I couldn’t wait to come home, but it took
a long time, because the war was still going on. We were already liberated, but the war was still
going on. There was a time, finally when I came home. Oh God, took a long time.
Q: Tell me about the rest of the journey, how you got back home.
A: Well, you could take a train, you didn’t have to pay, you know, I told you that. I was sitting
for days on the train with coal, that I remember. It was bitter cold, yeah. It was very, very cold.
And finally, finally, I came home. And when I came home, it was night, and I was on the train,
and they took us right away, whoever was in the train, they took us to a place that was a cellar in
a building. And there they did give us some to eat or drink. I wasn’t by myself, there were maybe

with me, 12 or 14 other people. And they did give us some tea, not made from tea, from
something else. And in the morning the curfew was over, and you c -- you could go out. And I
went out and I did noc -- I did not know where I am, where I was. The buildings were bombed. I
had no idea in which district I am. It was terrible. But then I went to this Jewish community, and
there -- everybody has to go there to say, I’m alive. So I went there, and there was a letter from
somebody who said, whoever knows Anna Vietner, that’s the name, should come to that and that
address. 15 district [indecipherable], I remember like today. I knew her, so I went there. And her
maid was still there, and they had the beautiful apartment taken from the Nazis. They run away,
you know? They left everything. So she had a beautiful apartment, and I was home, thanks God,
I was home. Had a place to stay, and very soon, I got the job, I start working, yeah. A displaced
person camp, the hospital, start working in the hospital. I met a doctor in the street, which I
knew, after the liberation. He said to me, “What are you doing?” I said, “I am doing nothing.”
There is nothing. There is nothing. Like nothing, that doesn’t exist. You come tomorrow
morning to the [indecipherable] hospital. But that wasn’t a hospital, was a displaced person
camp. There were parents without children, children without parents, and they waited to go
someplace. I div -- I start to work with him in the [indecipherable] room, yeah.
Q: Is this in Vienna as well?
A: That was in Vienna. There I was home already, yeah. I was home already, yeah.
Q: So that was your m -- that was your goal after the war, was to return to Vienna, right?
A: [had nothi -- no -- nowhere else to go.
Q: And did you spend -- after you were liberated from Auschwitz, did you spend from January til

Q: Were you scared during that time period?
A: I can’t remember that. I only know I wanted to go home. And of course, you know, you come
home and you -- there is nobody. There is nothing. You are home, but it’s not home any more.
And then my sister did find me, we had relatives. One of our cousins was married to Catholic girl
that the [indecipherable] relatives were living in Vienna, and my sister was in Italy. And she did
write to her, and so she did find out that I am alive. And it wasn’t easy to go over the border.
There were no passports, there were nothing, and the border was closed like that. And every
night I went there, oh God [indecipherable] snow up to here. Never could cross to Italy. And
finally, one day, it’s happened that I met somebody, a man to whom I did give a pair of shoes,
when we had some, there was -- had also [indecipherable] from the concentration camp. And he
was, “What are you doing here?” I said, “I am waiting s -- to go to Italy.” So he said to me,
“Don’t go, I will send you somebody. Don’t be afraid, you just try to enjoy, and to get well
again.” And he did give me money. At that time I was smoking a lot of [indecipherable]
cigarettes. And he said, “Somebody will come to pick you up.” And one day I came home, and
there was a British soldier waiting for me, and he was very rude. Where were you? I said, “What
is your business, who are you?” Break in my room, waiting for me. He told me, “I come to pick
you up.” And I was dressed like a British soldier lady. I had the [indecipherable] like that, and I -
- he had papers that I belong to a troop of people who -- who went to entertain the troops in Italy.
That’s how I crossed the border. And then I called my sister, and then everything was all right
again. I was home.
Q: So you stayed in Italy?
A: The stay in Italy, yeah, and then I went home. I -- I went to Vienna.

day Austrians, people in the streets, people you would meet, people who were not Jewish, did
you -- was it difficult to interact with them after the war? Did you feel resentment?
A: Me, I can -- I can tell you only one thing, I wasn’t very happy being home. When I come
home, our superintendent said to me, “Oh, you are still alive?” Like he would be not surprised,
like he would be not very happy about it. And somebody else had our apartment, so I did cr -- I
did leave it to other people. But I had a job, I was happy, yeah. I was quite satisfied. I wi -- I had
the job, I had money, which it was important. I remember when I got my first [indecipherable]

A: Well, she was very surprised to see me, and I don’t know, we were denounced from
somebody. Because we were there for a long, long time, and we used -- we have to go away from
time to time to stay someplace else for a week, then we came back. But somebody denounced us,
and we were arrested there. We came back at five o’clock in -- in the afternoon, at four o’clock
in the morning the Gestapo came and arrested us. And then we came to Auschwitz, and then we
were selected. My husband went here, I here. I said, “I want to go with my husband.” Mengele
was sitting there, and he said, “Be glad you are not going.” And I never will forget the color of
my husband’s face, gray. He knew. And I knew where he is going, yeah.
Q: How did you emotionally deal with that at the time?
A: I never will be able to tell you, because I knew what will happen to him, yeah.
Q: Now, after the war, when you came back to Vienna --
A: Yeah?
Q: -- was it -- was it nice to see the woman who hid you, what was that like to see her again?
A: Well, I can’t remember, I tell you. I went with other people to [indecipherable] because the
Israeli [indecipherable] there was a letter from Anna Vietner, whom I know. It said, whoever
knows Anna Vietner should go there and there. And when I came there, they were hidden al --
th-through the whole war. She, her mother. Her maid must have hidden them, yeah, opened the
door for me, and she started yelling when she saw me, and I was home. Was with people who
knew me, who loved me, and I did feel good, yeah.

A: Well, she was a lady I knew, and much older than I.
Q: Was she Jewish, or not?
A: Jewish, yeah.
Q: And she was --
A: But she looked like a Nazi. She didn’t look Jewish at all, and she was dressed like one even.
And she went -- wherever she went, her name was Vietner, wherever she went, she said, heil
Vietner, which sounded like heil Hitler.
Q: And that helped her get through the war?
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Q: So she helped you when you got back to Vienna?
A: Yeah.
Q: And did you search for other relative -- for relatives of yours?
A: [had very little relatives. My mother had two sisters. One was dead already, one was deported
a long time [indecipherable] there, and I had very little relatives, to think about it. I had relatives,
but not in Vienna.
Q: And what about your mom -- your mother, did you already know what had happened?
A: She was in Theresienstadt, you know about Theresienstadt?
Q: Yeah, I’m just wondering when did you learn about -- about what happened with your
mother?
A: Well, when I came -- I -- I went to my mother from time to time -- not from time to time, but
at least twice a week when I -- I was hidden, and I -- I remember it was late in the spring and I
had a little box with strawberries. And I had to clean my hand to open the elevator. And the

up last evening. And she was in Theresienstadt. And I knew the superintendent in other district,
and I spoke with her and we did make packages and mail them to Theresienstadt. And she
received it, I know that, because one day, maybe after one and a half years, was a long time she
was there, maybe a year or so, a red letter came back that she was relocated. Then I knew that
she went to Auschwitz.
Q: Did you ever try to find her at Auschwitz?
A: How could I?
Q: Was that while you were still there, or after?
A: No, I knew that she is not alive. Children and old people they gassed right away. We knew
that. We did listen to the British sender. We knew exactly what’s going on.
Q: When did it become clear to you -- was it already after the war, how massive the Holocaust
really was?
A: How what?
Q: How -- how massive the Holocaust really was, how many Jews, how many people were really
victimized.
A: I -- [knew it. I knew it from Auschwitz. We had selections, when you had one pimple on
your body -- you know, they were so afraid of scabies, because we were a labor force which
didn’t cost any money. We worked very hard. So if they -- you had one pimple on your body,
you went, yeah. Were selections very often, I would say at least once a week. We washed at
night. When we came back from work, we worked very hard, cleaning stones and everything.
When we came back, in the washrooms, that water was dripping, no water. We couldn’t even
clean ourself. And one night I woke up, I saw two from our block that was where we were
staying, block 13, go out -- everybody has a towel. I run after them and they went into the

washrooms and that water was flowing. There was water and water [indecipherable] then I woke
up Annie, we went every night, we washed from top to bottom with ice cold water, but we
keeped ourselves clean, yeah.
Q: You never had hot water?
A: No. Hot water? Oh God. We were glad we had cold water to wash.
Q: So, back to Vienna after the war, it sounds like you spent a considerable amount of time in
Italy, and then you had returned to Vienna on the weekends, and about how long did -- did this
go on for?
A: Every weekend for a long time, I went back to Vienna.
Q: And how long did you stay in Italy?
A: Italy I was a long time. One year in Milan, and two years in Rome.
Q: And were you happier living in Italy than Vienna?
A: Oh, I was happy in Italy, oh God. I loved Italy so much. Wonderful country, wonderful
people.
Q: Were you still thinking you might return to live in Vienna someday?
A: No.
Q: Why would you --
A: IT--
Q: -- why did you know you didn’t want to live there any more?
A: Well, I wouldn’t want to go there. I -- I told you I went there [indecipherable] I wouldn’t be
there, no. I was there once, after the war, on a trip to Europe. No.
Q: Why? Is it -- was it just not the same?

A: I wouldn’t want it any more. I -- first of all, I love a -- America. United States, and I loved
Italy. But I hated Austria, oh yeah.
Q: After the war, when did you make contact again with your friend Ann Price -- Ann Green?
A: Well, she was with me all the time, for a long time. But then we were separated. And I, very
soon, was liberated, but she still was not liberated where she was. They had a selection, she went
on transport, and I did remain. That was the night where they gassed all the Gypsies, yeah. Killed
them, all the Gypsies.
Q: Had you known some of them personally?
A: No.
Q: So when did you meet up again with Ann after the war? Was it in Vienna?
A: I suppose so. Was in Vienna, yeah. She’s not from Vienna, you know, Ann Green. She’s from
the little town Noyen Kyrklund. She’s not Viennese.
Q: But it seems like at some point you -- you met up with her again, and you became good
friends again, right?
A: Yes, we were. She is much younger than I am, you know that. She is 15 years younger than I.
Q: But it sounds like the two of you were very helpful to one another.
A: Oh yeah.
Q: Do you think it’s largely because of that friendship that you were able to make it through?
A: Yeah, yeah. I told her, when we came to Auschwitz, and she came to me very upset, showing
me she had in her panties, in the seams she did find a louse. So I said to her, “Annie, listen to me,
if I will take care of your lice, I will not be able to take care of mine. You will not live and I will
not live. If you will listen to me and do whatever I tell you, maybe we will make it.” And that
how it was. We went every night, I woke her up, let’s go and wash, because then the water was

flowing. We had never water when we came home from work. But at night we had no towel,
nothing. But we were undressed, we washed from top to bottom, yeah, every night.
Q: Were there a lot of people who did not wa-wash so regularly?
A: Oh yeah. Sure, there was no water.
Q: So you made a --
A: [indecipherable] the selections, as you know, wi -- you were not -- you were not hundred
percent clean, I mean clean your skin, they were afraid of sicknesses, and you were gassed, sure.
Q: So you made a special effort to stay clean?
A: Oh yeah. I knew it’s important.
Q: Now it sounds like you and Ann have reminisced, you know, about your experiences together.
Do you often talk about your experiences?
A: No. We sometimes laugh about, you know, there were funny things too, who happened. So
we speak about it, we laugh. But we normally, no we don’t.
Q: Do you think it’s too difficult to talk about these things?
A: Sure, it’s still too difficult. If you were in Auschwitz, you learn how to steal. You know,
everybody likes to survive. So whatever you see you could steal, you steal. You don’t have a bad
conscious if you do that.
Q: What about your memories, even if you weren’t speaking out loud about them, do these
memories come to you a lot of -- of these experiences?
A: No. Sometimes I do think about it, but I didn’t think about it at all because my life was full,
you know, after the war. I had a good life, I was happily married. But now, sometimes I do
remember, yeah.
Q: Do you allow yourself to remember more, or do you try to block some of the memories?

A: No, I still like to block them out.
Q: It’s just easier that way?
A: Yeah, sure.
Q: Now tell me about your journey coming to the U.S.. How is it that you came to the U.S., and
when was that?
A: What happened is, I was in Italy, and there was my brother, who always wrote and said
everybody’s here, everybody’s here. No you -- why don’t you come, why don’t you come? I was
so happy in Italy, but then I went to [indecipherable] and I had rheumatic fever, I told you. They
had put 30,000 dollar down for me. And then I went to the United States, and then I went here. It
happened my brother even didn’t -- excuse me -- live in the United States. He was living in
British West India. Yeah, I had nobody here.
Q: When did you arrive?
A: I wish I would remember.
Q: I see here that somebody wrote down 1952.
A: That’s could be, yeah. That’s could be. Yeah, 1950 fi -- I became a citizen 1955. Must be nine
-- 1950. After five years you -- you become a citizen, no?
Q: I believe that’s right. I’m not sure, maybe something was different at that time.
A: No.
Q: So, even though your brother wasn’t here, you decided to come to the U.S., why?
A: Because he s -- said I should come. And then my disappointment was terrible. He was living
in British West India.
Q: So where did you first arrive in the U.S.? Did you take a -- a boat, and where did it -- where
did --

took a job in Troy, New York, was by Albany.
Q: Were you on your own, or did you have any family or friends?
A: [had friends, yeah, I had friends. Have no family here. My brother then was living in
Venezuela -- no, my brother in British West India, my cousins in Venezuela.
Q: As Ise --
A: But I started to make money -- to earn money and I was happy, yeah.
Q: What kind of work were you doing?
A: Whatever I could. First of -- I was crocheting, and then came that I had no money left, that
week was over, I hardly make money to pay my room. And then I went and look for other job,
and I got a job as [indecipherable] a whole -- they put together orders for custom jewelry, whole
day on the ladder. And the boss was terrible. I made 30 dollars a week. I paid 10 dollars for my
room, and at that time, you know, five dollar, five cent coffee and a roll. I did -- then I washed
my hand in the evening, my boss came, and he’d give me my envelope, put his hand in here, and
said don’t tell my wife, I just give you five dollar more. I called my brother, and I said, “I am not
going back any more. But what will happen to me?” He said, “You are in America. Here you

don’t have to go back. If he asks you why aren’t you coming back, you could tell him, I don’t
like the color of your hair. There’s no explanation. You don’t want to, you don’t go.” And then I
took a job outside New York. No, then I took a job at -- I met a doctor -- oh God -- then I met a
doctor I knew in Europe, and he was a Sephardic [indecipherable] in Brooklyn, all the way
down. He said come and work with us. I took that job.
Q: Did you feel a greater sense of freedom in -- in the U.S.?
A: I did feel absolutely freedom. You know, the first time, after a long time that I have f-felt that
Iam a free person. I remember when we were liberated, I was in Krakow, that is Poland, you
know? And I did see myself walking on the street, like it wasn’t allowed to walk on the
boardwalk, is -- are you crazy? You’re a free person. You could go wherever you want.

So I said to him, ““N-Never again ask me to play in your game.” He said, “That’s all right, but
may | invite you for dinner?” And I said, “I wouldn’t go with you.” But in the end we all went.
Friends of mine, we all went together, and very soon we were married, yeah. Was a Friday
holiday, he said he could get downtown, cost two dollars, get married, and then we have four

Q: What was his name?
A: Seno. S-e-n-o.
Q: And his last name?
A: Windholm.
Q: Go ahead.
A: And now you ask me about the chicken, [indecipherable] reminded me, it’s true. You know,
my mother told me I should pick up the chickens, they were by the [indecipherable], you know,
made them kosher, they k-kills them. So I went to put them -- pick them up, and I had the canvas
bag. There were two chickens, that they started, you know, to move. And I was so afraid, I throw
them away, with the bag. But ha -- later they did find them. I came home without the chicken.
You asked me that, right?
Q: So what happened when you got home?
A: When I get [indecipherable] home, where are the chickens? I said I throw them away. I was
afraid they were still alive. So did you know, at that time, nobody took anything. Was different
times.
Q: Did you get in trouble?
A: No. I didn’t get in trouble. My mother was a wonderful person.
Q: So Ihave just a few additional questions I think --

difficult for you to adjust to normal life after the war, after the Holocaust?

A: In every way. You know, I told you, I did find myself walking on the street -- I was afraid to
go on the boardwalk, you know? And took a long time to come back to a normal life. When I
started working, that did help me a lot. I was busy, and you know, I had very little time to think
about myself. I was tired, I started to sleep good, yeah.
Q: How do you think -- how do you think your experiences during the Holocaust affected --
affected you afterwards, affected you later, decisions you made in your life --
A: Well, what should I tell you? I tried to live a normal life. I was happily married, I told you
that. I lost my husband, I was very unhappy. I had a boyfriend later, I was very happy again. And
then, when he passed away, I said, I don’t want to cry after men any more in my life. Now I will
stay by myself. I lost a lots of people I loved dearly, and that what it is.

Beginning Tape Four, Side A
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Marianne Windholm. This is tape number four, side A. If you could just continue with what you
were telling me.
A: What did I tell you? Yeah, of course the biggest shock for me was to lose my eyesight. But I
am a very lucky in one respect. I have good people around me whom I love, and they are good to
me, and I am good to them. So I tried to keep a normal life, that is it. 1 watch television -- I watch
-- I listen to radio, I listen to television, and of course, my life is different than from a normal
person, but I have to cope with it. There’s nothing what I could do.
Q: Did you ever turn to religion or prayer?
A: No.
Q: Do you observe the holidays?
A: No.
Q: The Jewish holidays?
A: No.
Q: Was that something that you just didn’t feel connected to?
A: Well, I did grow up in a house where every holiday was kept. We had separate dishes for
Easter, beautiful dishes, and we kept every holiday, of course. But now I don’t keep anything.
Q: Do you think the Holocaust had any effect on your thoughts about religion?
A: I don’t think so. I still say oh God. You know what I mean?

Q: Have you ever given thought to the question of -- of God and the Holocaust, if there’s -- if
there’s a God, how could the Holocaust have happened?
A: Well, it’s not the first time. There was the Spanish Inquisition, there was a English
Inquisition, as far as I remember, I don’t know. I am correct, I suppose. And this is not the first
time that happened. We are still, after the Chinese, the oldest people on earth. The Chinese are
older than we are.
Q: Even though you -- you did not observe the religion, did you stay very connected in your
identity, to Judaism?
A: Well, I never say I’m not a Jew. That what I say [indecipherable] now. Some of the
[indecipherable] me in the building for Easter and ask me, are that your holidays or ours? So I
said, “You want to know if I am Jewish? I am.”
Q: Have you ever had any dreams or nightmares that go back to the time period of the war?
A: No. I don’t think so.
Q: And when did you start talking more about your experiences during the war? When did you
start to do that?
A: I never talked about it. With whom?
Q: Like with Debbie, or with, you know, any of the people you’re close to.
A: Normally I only start to tell them what is funny. Funny stories, yes, nothing else.
Q: Do you think it’s unusual that -- that you’re able to -- to capture those funny moments? Do
you think a lot of people would not remember the funny moments?
A: How could I know what other people do? I never speak with them.
Q: But it does seem like the humor is very important to you.

now, and --

Q: About -- about the Holocaust, about your experiences?

the concentration camp. You learn how to steal, oh yeah. I run after breakfast. I always had two
breakfasts, when they did bring the milk by in the morning, I waited for them by the
[indecipherable] pass by and boom, took some out. Had to drink it and run back to the block to
have my second breakfast. When I did something wrong, they didn’t send me to work, so I will
not get a second potato, but I had to go to pick up the potatoes, somebody has to go. I have so
many potatoes, oh God, yeah. It was not easy, yeah. Yeah.
Q: Has it been difficult during this interview for you to remember certain things?
A: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
Q: Is there anything else you would like to share? Any other memories?
A: L only know one thing. I was happy. And my sister did find me to the Vatican. And when I
went to see her, finally came to Italy to be with her. She passed away last year, in August.
