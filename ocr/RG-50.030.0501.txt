Q: You were Freddie in the resistance?
A: Yes.
Q: Uh-huh. Now you were born in 1925, but your -- your father moved to Alsace in 1926, is that
right?
A: That is correct.
Q: But you didn’t move then?
A: We moved about one or two years later. My father opened up a business over there, and we
moved in afterwards.
Q: And do you know why he moved? I mean, did you hear later, as -- when you got older, why
he left Germany?
A: Well, it’s an opportunity, you know, because Germany had [indecipherable] so he had
opportunity to go there. But he didn’t know anyone, but he had a partner over there by the name
of Camille Ernst, E-r-n-s-t.
Q: Right.
A: And th-this was a -- I guess, a metals recycling plant.
Q: And what was he doing when he was in Germany? What was his work? The same kind of
work?
A: Actually, before he went there, he went to Israel. He was sent -- oh, Palestine at that time, to
found a kibbutz, which was called Mahane Israel.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Mahane, M-a-h-a-n-e, Israel. I went on vacation there, years later, and I found the place again.
It had been damaged because there was a combat going on there in 1948.
Q: Right.

A: So Ihave pictures with the walls all shot up, yeah.
Q: So he went there in the 20’s, in the early 20’s, before you were born?
A: Yes, in -- about ’22 or ’23.
Q: Right.
A: Somewhere like that.
Q: And what -- so that he didn’t have a business in Germany, when he came back, he decided to
go to Alsace, you think?
A: Lam not sure that time, because -- I do know that -- the funny part I heard is that he was once
on the train traveling, and then he bought a home, sight unseen, from someone on the train. That
-- so I guess he must have had money at the time, and if he had any occupation, I would not
know.
Q: Right.
A: That’s the kind of a person he was, I mean, makes decisions on the spur of the moment.
Q: Right. Did you take after him?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: Sometimes I wish I did.
Q: Uh-huh. So when you moved to Alsace, you lived in a small town called sal --
A: Selestat.
Q: Selestat.
A: Yes. And that is where he went into business with Camille Ernst.
Q: Right. Which turned out much later to be very important.
A: Absolutely.

A: All -- bot -- all iron, you know, is just like what they do over here nowadays, it’s -- material
can be reused again.

Q: So then he would sell it?
A: Yes.
Q: Sell the -- sell this --

it was called, and some kids used to pick on me to the point where I did not want to go to school,
and I was hiding near the house, in the house, actually, under the stairway, until a neighbor found
me over there and reported me to my mom. So she took me to school at that time. I-It -- it -- it
went on for a few days before she caught me.
Q: Really?
A: Yes.
Q: So you would stay there all day and then when it was time for kids to come home, you’d
come out?

A: Correct.
Q: And your mother hadn’t figured this out?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: Because I was hidden under the staircase.
Q: So how did the neighbor find you? Why did the neighbor even look for you? Do you know?

Q: I see.
A: -- they ha -- reported me.
Q: Did you -- did you tell your mother why you were doing that?
A: Yes.
Q: And what did she say?
A: She took me to school and she told the teacher why I was missing classes.
Q: Uh-huh, right.
A: And the teacher then brought it up to the other students, and that ceased, and there was no
more problem.
Q: So there was no more problem, they left you -- it was fine? Why was this kid picking on you?
A: Well, you know, there’s always big bullies in -- everywhere.
Q: Everywhere. Were you close with your father?
A: Yes.
Q: As a -- as a young -- as a young kid as well?

moved to Colmar. I believed I showed you a picture of the exposition that we had.

Q: Right.
A: Yeah.
Q: So, was he hurt in that accident, is that why he changed to go to the radio business?

opened up the other business.

A: No, but ye --
Q: -- he stay -- did he stay in this other business?

A: Yes, and I found time for newspaper, too. Now, in 1933, I was interested in what was going
on, because my relatives lived in Germany --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- that time, Frankfurt. My grandfather lived there, my uncles. It was a family of eight -- 10
children, actually. My mother was one of the 10.
Q: Wow.
A: So, one of her sisters had -- moved to Brazil, and she came to Colmar -- no, to Selestat on the
way to Brazil, she stayed a few days with us.
Q: Right.
A: But then we still had eight brothers over there, a-and sisters. One of her brothers was killed by
the Nazis on the Kristallnacht. What happened is, when they were looking, the police was
looking for the Jews to arrest them, he was in the cellar. And when the two policemen came
down there, they found him -- okay, I should go back a little bit. One of the neighbors in the
house watched my cousin, his son, bring him food, and followed him and saw that he was going
to the cellar and -- where my uncle was hidden. So he reported him to the police. When the
police came, he was making believe that he was chopping some wood for the fireplace, and the
Germans accused him of having threatened him with the ax.
Q: With the ax, hm.
A: And they said that he died of a heart attack. My -- my cousin, the older one, his oldest son,
opened up the casket later on. He found out that he had been beaten in the face, and shot through
the heart.
Q: Wow.

A: So there was no question about that he had been murdered, you know. So his mother sent him
to England on the Kindertransport to get him out of the way --
Q: The older -- the oldest, right.
A: -- because he was the oldest one. The other one follow -- the middle one followed later on.
The youngest one is the one that the neighbor had spied on.
Q: Right.
A: And he remained with the mother. She went to Belgium, and I met her there after the war. She
was hiding in a farm, under a false name also.
Q: Right, right. So between ’33, and ’39, are you discussing politics in your home, or you’re just
-- you’re reading the newspapers and seeing what’s going on in Germany?
A: Well, y-yes, we -- we discussed what was going on in Germany, because my mother was very
much concerned about her family there.
Q: Right.
A: And then in ’39 -- my father had family in Poland, so he was concerned about it too.
Q: Concerned about family, too, right.
A: And what happened, in the Kristallnacht, my other uncle, one of my mom’s brothers, Willie,
was arrested, and he went to the camp of -- starts with an R, I forget the name now. It -- this
became a woman’s -- women’s camp.

home for orphans at the time.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: I found out later on that the Nazi kids broke into the orphanage and attacked th-the -- the girls
over there.
Q: I see.

to relatives later on, she said no, apparently she committed suici-cide after what happened.

A: Absolutely
Q: Did you see that early on? Do -- could you -- could you tell?
A: No, his one concern was for his family.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: How to make a living. It was difficult at the time too, because in Paris you could not be
employed, as a foreigner, you know, not to take jobs away from local people, so they had to be
self-employed. So this is very difficult.
Q: Right, yes.
A: Especially since he did not speak French either. Alt -- al -- Al-Alsatian and German.
Q: So he spoke Alsatian and German, he never learned French?
A: Not at that time, no. When he went to southern France, then he picked it up fine, yes.
Q: Uh-huh. But still he wasn’t fluent, so you were fluent.
A: Yes.

A: And French, yes.

too.
Q: Uh-huh. So then he took over at that point.
A: Yes.
Q: Yes. So your mother was a mother long before she was a biological mother.
A: Correct.

A: And they immediately put him in charge of a post in a school where they expected possibly
the Germans are using war gas. So he was in a disinfection station. And he organized it in an
excellent way. He got -- and made sure that the -- all the equipment that they needed, and that
they appreciated it very much, what he did for this place in -- this was an interesting one, in case
of a failure of power, he had bicycles put in there, remove -- well, they put them on -- on the
stand basically, and they had generators on the bike.
Q: Right, so they could use the bicycles.
A: For lights.
Q: Right.
A: That was a very --
Q: Very smart.
A: -- ingenious at that --
Q: Yes.
A: [indecipherable] time, since they had no money to buy all the equipment they needed. And
then we had training over there, the Dr. Sitlow was in charge civil defense, and he came on and
give us training and first aid and decontamination. Now why -- this is actually how I got
involved, because my father says, “Come on down to the classes, this is very interesting for you,
too.” This how I involved, I was about 13 - 14 years old.
Q: Cause you were 14, right.
A: Yes, and he got his diploma, I think I have it with me.
Q: And you got a diploma.
A: I got one too, I -- I didn’t bring it with me, I couldn’t find it at the time, but I, the same as he.

A: Max was employed.
Q: He was employed?
A: Yes, he was a shoe salesman in a store.
Q: I see. Now, this civil defense work was done because they were afraid of the Nazi attack, am I
right?
A: Yes, we are close to the border.
Q: Yes.
A: So, no, the -- the Maginot Line was there, but you can’t come in with planes, you can’t come
close [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: You know. So as a matter of fact, at one time on a Sunday, we had about seven or eight
alarms going off, planes coming over, to the point where you refused to go back in the cellar.
They had the civil defense sa -- protection of the house, but we are sick and tired of going up and
down, up and down, up and down.
Q: So what’d you do?
A: Just stayed in the apartment.

A: Well, from August, or September of 1939, til we left Colmar. What happened is the Germans
invaded Belgium on the 10" of May, 1940.
Q: Right.
A: So things got aya -- off of that point. And the Germans captured Belgium, the French
resistance broke down.
Q: Right.
A: They came across the Vosges mountains, which was the -- here is [indecipherable]. We are in
Colmar in the Alsace in the plains, and the Vosges mountains, the Germans came around
because the Maginot Line was facing one way. All the guns were facing --
Q: The other way.
A: -- east.
Q: Yeah.
A: And they couldn't be turned round. That was a really stupid move on the part of the French
army.
Q: Right.
A: But they thought that the -- it was only meant as a temporary measure to give chance to
France to mobilize its troops.
Q: Right.
A: This was the purpose was of the Maginot Line.

Beginning Tape Two
Q: Fred, you were describing the German attack of France.
A: Okay, so the Germans attacked through Luxembourg and Belgium --
Q: Right.
A: And Holland, of course. And they came around the mountain, the Vosges mountains. On the
15" of June, 1940, they open up with the artillery on the other side of the Rhine. We were about
19 kilometers from the Rhine, so it did not affect us directly, but we knew things were going
wrong. So my father was on duty at the zo -- station, yeah, on the 14'", and already he is -- people
that work for him in the first aid station, start to question, when the Germans come in, should we
salute them heil Hitler, or should we salute them the French way? My father says, “Oh-oh, this
doesn’t sound good.” So immediately he went to his superior and asked for a transfer out to go to
interior of France. He received an ordre démission. It’s an order that the authorities have to help
him out to go to where he has to go, and this was Bordeaux, on the other end of France. We were
told to be at the railroad station at --
Q: Can I stop you for a minute?
A: Certainly.
Q: Whe -- when your father realizes that everybody around him is trying to figure out how to
accommodate the Germans.
A: Right.
Q: So does he think of himself as vulnerable because he’s Jewish, you think?
A: Absolutely. It’s cl --
Q: He does? It’s very clear to him.
A: Oh yes, because of the -- what happened to his two brother-in-laws.

Q: What happened to --
A: The brother-in-laws.
Q: Uh-huh, right. And he knew that.
A: Sure, he knew that.
Q: Right. So when he goes to his superior, does he say look, I -- you know, this is dangerous for
me and family and I have got to get out.
A: There was no question --
Q: There was no question.
A: He wa -- he will be given the authority to leave, and to get the help of -- assistance of
[indecipherable] authorities --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- to go to Bordeaux.
Q: Okay, so you’re going to go to Bordeaux the next day.
A: No, we tried.
Q: You tried.
A: On the 15", we go -- we are told to go -- be at railroad station at 10 o’clock in the morning.
We go there, the train had left about si -- seven o’clock in the morning. That was the last train
out of Colmar.
Q: So do you think you -- he was given bad information on purpose --
A: No.
Q: -- or people just didn’t know?
A: No, I guess they were realizing the situation was worse than they thought, and they had to
leave earlier.

Q: Uh-huh, I see.
A: So we had actually left the house with a few things on our back, and a bicycle. We figured,
oh, we are going to be gone for a short time, and be back soon, so we didn’t take too much,
except what we could take with us. Silverware, and food, and that’s about it, you know. So my
father decides we are going to walk.
Q: To Bordeaux?
A: On the road, on the road. So we go south, and there is a Protestant minister, he comes along
with a horse drawn carriage, and he seems to realize what goes on, and he invites my sister and
my mother on the cart, because he had room for two people. And he rides on a few miles, and --
kilometers, and drops them off when he takes it off-road. We, in the meantime catch up with my
mom and sister, and quickly walking, I’m not sure how lo -- how far we walking, we must have
walked between eight and 10 miles. Along comes this army truck that is going back -- was
retreating, and they pick us up. With the bicycle, too. That was wonderful. There was nobody
else on the road except us.
Q: Really?
A: When the minister left us, he says, “God be wi -- wi -- will be with you.” He realized what
was going on. And so we --
Q: Does it -- does it surprise you now that nobody else was on the road, that you were the only
ones on the road?
A: Right.
Q: Doesn’t that seem surprising?
A: Well, you know, the local people didn’t have to worry about the Germans.
Q: Germans.

A: Other ones may not have the means, or no -- no car, or so --
Q: Right.
A: Remember that the French army had the authority to requisition cars for their needs.
Q: I see.
A: Because there are only so many army trucks or whatnot, and they had all -- also requisitioned
our car.
Q: Uh-huh, so you didn’t ha -- I see, you --
A: The military. So we didn’t have transportation.
Q: -- didn’t have a car.
A: That’s right.
Q: What did your dad tell you and the kids? What di -- were you frightened when you were on
this trip?
A: Well, we were very concerned, of course. We were not pleased to -- to leave, you know, on
foot or so. But we thought it was an emergency, and my parents know what’s best for us.
Q: Right.
A: So the truck drove us for some distance, and had dropped us off. Along comes this so --
young recruit, actually it was a civilian in a car, and he has orders to report to a certain area. So
he takes us on. We are driving down to Dole . . . Dijon, that area, and things got very hot. There
was a big tank -- gas tank, burning. I’m not sure if the army had done it to destroy it, or if the
Germans had machine-gunned it, but it was burning at night. That gave us a chance to drive at
night with, you know -- but at that point we run into traffic.
Q: Mm?

A: And got really hectic. If somebody run out of gas, or had a pa -- had a problem with his car,
the cars behind him stopped, pushed him off the road, with the people inside.
Q: Really?
A: Nothing get in the way. They had to go on. It was terrible. There is no es -- it’s me, me, me
and I don’t care about anybody else.
Q: It’s really scary.
A: It was very scary, especially when they don’t let the people get out of the car.
Q: Right, right. So you saw that?
A: Yes. And we got to [indecipherable], we got to Rouen, we got into a train, and oh, the
démission gave us permission to go on any train, in any -- get any assistance from the military or
civilians. So the train stops a few miles down, and they tell us to get out. No, the -- at -- the train
stops in the station, and there’s a Italian plane flying over. And we say, oh gosh, they were
machine gunners.
Q: Right.
A: They -- it was in front of our compartment, it was a flatbed with a machine gun, right, a
French machine gun, and about three or four French soldiers. That was a bad situation because
civilians and military -- if you see troops there, you have a right to shoot at them.
Q: Right.
A: If you believe in the Geneva Convention that civilians are protected.
Q: Right.
A: Then came the order, all civilians off the train. We are expecting an attack by Italian planes.
So we get out of the station. I think it was just a trick. The French authorities want to have the
train to themselves to put more troops on there. We go outside of the station and there my father

meets a couple from Frankfurt -- he never knew -- I mean, he knew who they were, and they
didn’t speak French. And they were -- then we -- we gave them, we talked to them. They owned
a movie -- a -- a movie i-in Frankfurt, and my parents knew about that. So they said, what are
you doing here? They said, well, they’re here from Belgium, they had escaped from Belgium,
and they were completely lost. So my father decides, we are going back on the train now. And he
says, “You come with us, and don’t say a word.” There is a soldier there with a fixed bayonet to
prevent people from going on. My father says, “You follow me.” And we go by, he presents the
order, and we walk right through. The soldier did not even have time to read it. He let us go by. I
mean, my father bluffed him.
Q: Right.
A: Get back on the train -- excuse me -- and then the train takes off.
Q: When you saw this, were you surprised at how your father was acting, or was this --
A: I guess h-he -- he surprised me, but I know I -- I just follow orders. He says, you know -
Q: No, I understand that, but it did surprise you that your father did that?
A: Oh, it surprised me very, yes. Especially because the people there --
Q: Right.
A: -- come with us, and -- and have their luggage, too, you know? So --
Q: So, clearly, the situation brought something out in your father.
A: It’s a decision -- they have -- time to make a decision.
Q: And he just made the decisions and just did things, right?
A: Then we go on the train, and now in the com-compartment there are some ci-civilians coming
on, and there is a guy from the -- a civilian, he has a French army pack with him.

Q: Right.
A: Right. He was in c -- i-in civilian clothes. And the -- the gendarmes are coming now, and
checking for deserters. My father says to the guy, “You better throw that pack out or they’re
going to arrest you.” Because he was a desert-serter. So he threw the pack out. He saved his
neck, probably, too, because he got [indecipherable]
Q: I’m sure he saved his neck.

Q: But your father was obviously so observant of what was going on --
A: Oh yes.

A: Oh yes.
Q: It was quite amazing.
A: Then there were some young students on the train, and they had mon -- a -- harmonicas and
they would sing th -- tha -- playing music. It was very encouraging, you know.

A: We had -- that’s all we had is bread at the time. We -- we shared it with them. And then we
stopped in the station, and th-there was a wine -- there was another tr-train on the other side of
the rail, and we looked out there, there’s a -- a soldier laying on the floor. The train had been
machine gunned, and this was a tank truck of wine, full of holes, and the soldiers were just
laying down letting the wine go into his mouth. He was so amusing, you know.
Q: He was the only -- only soldier doing this? [indecipherable]
A: He was [indecipherable] doing it for free, you know?
Q: Right.
A: I mean -- and then we go back on the train. We didn’t get -- we didn’t get off the train
because we didn’t want to t-take a chance on train leaving and leave us behind.
Q: Right, right. So you stayed on the train?
A: Yes. Different station, we run out of water, so farmers come over and sell us water, at a franc,
one franc per glass.
Q: That’s a lot of money.

bread with tha -- them. There were about four or five of them, you know, so we share the bread
with them, and they were so happy, because they had no-nothing.

This a-army unit, and this a -- a -- so --

Q: Right.
A: -- and nail them on. And then we had to -- we were there a few days. We went to Polish
consulate to get a passport. We did not have a passport.
Q: You had no -- you -- you -- your father had no passport at all?
A: No, he had a Spanish carte étrangére, foreigner --
Q: Right.
A: In France. It’s a green card.
Q: Right.
A: It’s like a passport also, different pages. So we get to the consulate, big lines over there.
Finally we get to the consul, I was with him, and he would like to have passport. The girl says,
“Where were you born?” In so and so, western Poland. He speaks Polish with the consul. He
says, “But you have no passport.” That’s why I am here for. I want to go get the documentation.
He says, “But you left Poland in 1919, that was when -- or ’18 -- when you became aus -- it was
Austrian before that, so you’re not actually Polish,” he says, “I can’t give you a passport, except
[indecipherable] exception, your son is -- the oldest one is 19 years old?” No, 17 or eight -- “18
years old, and if he joins the Polish army, I will give him a passport.” He said, “Thank you very
much.” [indecipherable] We left.
Q: So they were going to take Max in order to give you --
A: To him only. They would give him a passport.
Q: But not for any --
A: Big -- big favor.
Q: But not for anybody else.

Q: So you’re in France without any sort of identification except that you’re foreigners?
A: That’s right, there’s foreign -- like, it’s a green card of about eight, 10 pages, I believe, and
it’s like that.
Q: Right.
A: But only my parents had that, and my brother. My sister also, I believe, because they were
employed, so they had the same thing.
Q: And you had nothing?

A: And they pick up -- and they go from house to house, where they have foreigners, and they
pick them up. And they were all Jewish except two -- some Russians. The cart is full now, and
then I found out later what th -- the course was. The French government in Lotrower issued an
order that all those who came to France after 1936 should be sent to concentration camp.
Q: Right.
A: But the authorities had also the latitude to arrest anybody that came before 1936.
Q: Right.
A: And prefect did not like Jews particularly, so he said it doesn’t make a difference what the --
time they came in here.
Q: Take them.
A: As long as -- yes, take them. The reason originally of that was that France, Vichy government
was against Communists, came from Spain, from the 1936 revolution. So, they had those in mind
first, and then anybody that came from Belgium, Holland and Germany, and [indecipherable]
after °36.
Q: And what year was that ruling put into place, did you --
A: In 1940, in November. 1940.

signed in -- as foreigner you had to register.

A: Right.

the camp because we are still there [indecipherable] us, my mom, my brother and me.
Q: Right.

cattle car. French have a fancy name for it, eight horses or 40 men, huit hommes -- quarante
hommes ou huit chevaux, eight men -- o-or eight horses.
Q: Eight horses, right.
A: And put us in there. No windows. So it had maybe a small opening for air. And the cabin had
a few other people in it. And the train goes on the way, for hours and hours and hours. At night
we arrive, I believe is Montpellier. And in Montpellier they open up the door, and they let Red
Cross nurses give us some water.
Q: Give you water?
A: Yeah.
Q: Uh-huh. Then they close the doors again, and we continue to Agde. Everybody out, it’s
middle of the night. We had to march to the village of Agde, you know, with luggage and
whatnot. Was quite a march, and then went into the camp, and they say well, go to -- guys over
here. Women on one side, one -- some guys, one camp, men on the other camp. And they put us
in camp, they had -- a clo -- a cap -- a -- a head of the barrack, and he assigned us places on the
straw, and there is a double layer straws on the bottom, and on top there. I don’t remember if it

wash. They had a big -- a big pipe for water in the -- from faucets --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- [indecipherable] put a trough there, and we wash up, and then they serve us black coffee,
no sugar, nothing, and I guess they gave us a -- a bread for four people. We cut it up in pieces,
and took turns. Every time they serve bread, the f -- they were changed as a priority, one guy had
the -- the choice first, and the next one next time. So he could get the largest piece.
Q: I see.

could.

he took an old bench -- they had the stove there --

We did not have any coats then.
Q: You didn’t have a coat.
A: We got some coats later on, in Montpellier. But -- so we were there for about four or five days
I believe, and [indecipherable] in the morning, get your breakfast -- breakfast. My brother and I
were designated to go in the kitchen to work peeling potatoes. So the guys already give us a little
food they throw on the side, you know. But that just lasted one time, one day.

A: -- th-then [indecipherable] so then what happened is the camp commander let people go out
sometimes if they had to go to see a dentist or a doctor or so.
Q: Uh-huh.

A: And they brought in food. That helped. If those -- if you had money, you could buy some
stuff, you know. Well, when we realized that you could go out of certain -- on certain conditions,
we decided -- my father decided, let’s see if we can go out completely, permanently. So he --
there was a -- a young lady in the cap -- captain’s office, a st-stenographer. And my sister was
with her [indecipherable] in the same camp with the -- barrack with the woman, and she says,
you know, they need another s -- not stenographer, dactylo, a --a typist.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And w-why don’t you apply for a job? So my s -- my sister said okay. So she applies for the
job, and she was there a few days, my father says, you know, ask if I can go to a od -- to a -- the
prefecture in Montpellier, to see the governor. Just like that.
Q: Now let me ask you something. How did your father make contact with your sister, if you
were in different barracks?
A: Wel -- we had -- we had visiting times.
Q: There were visiting times?
A: Yes. Ev -- every --
Q: Every day, or no?

Q: I’ve got to figure out a way to get out.
A: Right. And -- at that time we did not know the 36 -- 1936 law.
Q: Yeah.
A: So my father -- my -- my sister is performing very satisfactorily for her --
Q: Right.
A: -- captain, and my father says, “Ask for permit to go to Montpellier,” for her and him, because
sh -- he didn’t speak French. Captain says fine, but he had hostages there, my mom, and my
brother and me --
Q: Right.
A: -- so he was not afraid he was -- escape.
Q: Right.
A: Fine, so they go to Montpellier, find out where the prefecture is, where the prefect’s office is,
and in the hallway, they’re already down there and this man comes towards them, and they look
at each other. The man says, “What are you doing here?” That was Camille Ernst.
Q: The man with whom your -- your father was the -- yeah.
A: Partner before. Father says, “We’re at camp in Agde.” So he says, “What? You are free.” And
he releases us either way, and he says to my father, are there more people that you know -- and
he explained to my father what the story was with the 1936 law, but you were here before. So he
says, “Do you know more people in the same situation that came before 1936 in the camp?” Off
the top of his head my father had met people already in the camp, in the barrack, and he
remembered -- thought of 36 people including us five.

A: And Ernst puts all the names down on the same list, he says they are all free. Then he says, “I
want you to stay in the camp of Agde, and in the village of Agde.” My father says “Why?” He
says, “I want you to help free all the people that can be freed from the camp.” He was -- a hand
to the heart. So my father says, “Well, how can they po -- ho-how can they be freed? What does
it need to be [indecipherable].” He says, “If they have the means, they came -- first of all, they
have to be in France since before 1936. They have to have the resources to exist in France
without falling in the charge of the French government.” That was important.
Q: And that was for a period of about a year, right?
A: About a year, if I remember correctly.
Q: Yes.
A: And my father says, “That’s nice. How about people who have no money?” He says, “We
will find a way.” And -- okay, so my father and my sister come back, my father sees -- become --
right away I see him, he says, “Keep your mouth shut, but we are free.” He didn’t want to cause
a panic in the -- in the barrack, you know, people getting all excited. And then he explains --
Q: And did -- did Mr. Ernst give your father --
A: A pass.
Q: A pass. So if you would --

them to help us find a place. And we ran out of funds at that time, because we could not go back
to -- Alsace was occupied. The banks, everything had been seized.

“Yes, come with us. I live in Celleneuve,” which is small village outside of Montpellier, we rode
up a trolley car. Went over there, we found this home. It was not the fanciest place, it has a stable
underneath there, but hey, we lived there, that’s it. So we stayed there for the first time, in ce --

certain cell blocks, homes. And they searched anybody in the street. If they see you walk into a
hallway, they would hassle you, because they knew that you were trying to hide. So they check
identity [indecipherable]. Then the -- if they had the ideas that you came to France after ’36, they

scouts, the leader. He [indecipherable] in one of the books by Ann Latour, which was
[indecipherable] here, was sold in the museum, and [indecipherable] name. Anyway, we found
places for some of the people, hiding places.
Q: Let me stop you for a moment. Aren’t you forgetting the f -- your father and sister going back
and forth into Agde?
A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. I --
Q: This i -- this is a very big, important story, yes?
A: Absolutely, absolutely. So, when he stayed in Agde, then he went to the camp commander,
Tassart, who helped him out, sort out who was there before 1936 --
Q: Right.
A: -- this was [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: And my father approached him, he says, “You can be free if you meet certain requirements.”

have no funds. You must lend it to them, and they give back to you when they get out.” Because
this was another of -- transaction outside the [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: So the -- okay, and my father was able to get about 1500 people out this way.
Q: It’s extraordinary story, you know. In how long a period of time was this go on? Months?
A: It was -- oh yes, oh yes. It was from November to February or March, just before we went to
Montpellier. This was --

A: -- in Agde.
Q: -- November of 1940.
A: 40 to °41.
Q: To 41.
A: About.
Q: To February °41.
A: I believe so. Now what happened at that time -- so these people were free. The other thing
happened. Ernst told my father, you know, I suspect anybody -- somebody over here is writing
down the serial numbers of the bills.
Q: Oh.
A: So we became money launderers, we trade the bills so there was always constant new supply.
Q: So who was doing the money laundering?
A: My brother, my sister and me.
Q: Your brother and your si -- the three of you.
A: The three of us. Went to grocery stores, we went to banks. We -- or so -- we brought food into
the camp, too. So people gave us the money to buy food for them, and so we had a-an exchange
also.
Q: Now, all of you had passes to go in and out.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: Right?
A: [have one here from my mom and my father. And the passport is for every day, seven days a
week. From eight o’clock in the morning til seven o’clock at night, that’s 11 hours. That wa --

Q: It’s really rather extraordinary, but this happened in a number of places in France, I gather,
that people were able to get passes to go in and out [indecipherable]
A: I don’t know about the other camps. I don’t know, I --
Q: But at least there.
A: [have no idea.
Q: Yeah.
A: But this camp, because of Ernst, was very important.
Q: Right.
A: And I have the original pass with me.
Q: Did your father see Ernst on a fairly regular basis, or not?
A: Well, every time people were freed, they had to get to Montpellier. And so they were
accompa -- accompanied by either my father, or my si -- [indecipherable] my father, my sister or
my sister [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: Yeah. Because they had to go through [indecipherable] over there. They didn’t had -- excuse
me -- they couldn’t send somebody to the camp.
Q: Right.
A: And then show the money [indecipherable], no, had to be [indecipherable]
Q: Right. But now, let me ask you something. When people didn’t have money --
A: Yes.
Q: -- and the people who did have money would lend them the money --
A: So they gave it to my sister --

A: -- to take back.
Q: Take it back so it can be used again.
A: To [indecipherable] the list, and then --
Q: Right.
A: -- return the money to people.
Q: But now these people leave, and they really don’t have money. So now, how do they survive?
A: Well, they went to Jewish Committee to help them out.
Q: In Montpellier.
A: Montpellier.
Q: I see.
A: That’s where they were hiding, in Montpellier, at that point. So --
Q: And then they were helped.
A: They were helped, yes. Some had the visa to go to other countries, they had visa to go to
Portugal. We have a very important pa -- place to go through it, to go to the United States.
Q: Yes.
A: Because if you had a visa from the United States, you had to go through port -- Spain or
Portugal, and many people waited in Portugal for their American visas to come through.
Q: Right.
A: So the Joint Distribution or other organizations helped them out monetarily to go to --
Q: Right.
A: -- these places.
Q: Right. Were you folks frightened during this period or did you all feel very safe once you had
the pass?

A: Well, as long as we knew Ernst, we felt very safe.
Q: Then you -- then you felt safe.
A: I forgot to say also, in those days they have also soup kitchen for all the refugees. Food, the --
either the Red Cross or other organizations had food, they sit -- they u -- went to those places. So
the people who came out of the camp, and us too for awhile, ate in those places because we had
no resources, you know?
Q: I see.
A: So --
Q: So your situation was not so terrible?
A: I’m sorry?
Q: Your situation was not so terrible, because there was this -- some food.
A: It -- it was not -- it was not that much food, either.
Q: It was not that much.
A: Or choice, but they --

Q: They were just sitting, and waiting.
A: 1 -- and then also, Montpellier, you had the Red Cross distributed clothing, and also the --
what was it called? Not the [indecipherable], the foundation army distributed clothing over there,
too. A reg --
Q: Clothing?
A: Yes.
Q: Oh.
A: For -- from the United States that they donated. So that’s where we got our first clothes, my

Q: They couldn’t bring it into the camp?
A: No. By the way, it was where the camp [indecipherable] in there, there was someone, and we
suspect it was an American journalist that was there, and it was behind the barrier that
[indecipherable] and the gendarmes were with him, so a few of us made a sign, “Nous avons
faim.” We are hungry. We moved that towards him. The gendarmes [indecipherable] too close,
and I hope he saw the sign.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: They didn’t force us to go back.
Q: Right.
A: Uh-huh.
Q: Huh. All right, so 1500 people get -- how many people were in this camp to begin with, do
you have any idea?
A: Thousands.
Q: Thousands?
A: Yes. I don’t [indecipherable] thousands -- I’d say probably between three and 4000, probably.
That means just the women --
Q: And were they all -- were they mainly Jews?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: They were Spaniards, and also military, foreign troops like Czechs. And I -- I don’t remember
[indecipherable] of Polish troops, but they were supposed to go to Africa when Germany won the
war.

A: But then they got stuck, there with no ships to take them to Africa, so they put them in the
camp.
Q: Now, how did people prove that they came to France before 1936? Did they -- or did --
A: You -- you --
Q: You have a -- you have an entrance pa --
A: A passport from a -- if you came from foreign countries, or even from France that you had a -
- your foreigner card. And a foreigner carte étrangére, has a pa -- passport when you came in --
ha-has a card showing when you came in.
Q: So the people who came in after 1936 were stuck in the camp?
A: And then, the worst that happened [indecipherable]. Then they decided to enter the camp and
transfer everybody to the camp of Rivesaltes.
Q: Right.
A: Which is near the Pyrenees, and there are terrible conditions. It was near the sea, and they had
the, I guess water running close by a-and the rain and whatnot.
Q: Right.
A: And so the camp commander, Tassart, said, “Well, I’d like to send a delegation of the people
to Rivesaltes to see how the conditions are, so they can convince the people in the camp that
things are not that bad over there the way [indecipherable].” It was one of those, what do you call
it? There was a Russian general who made fake visitors [indecipherable]
Q: Oh, Potemkin.
A: Potemkin.

Q: Right.
A: So they had places over there, and they saw [indecipherable] is, this has flowers over here,
and this and that, and so forth. Sidewalks and that. It was terrible when they got there, though.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: The food was not good, and that -- the Rivesaltes, th-they had just a few barracks they showed
them.
Q: Right. Now this is after you got out the 1500 people --
A: Correct.
Q: -- that they closed Agde and sent them to Rivesaltes, yes?
A: Correct. I know of one of the people that went to -- like, it was part of the [indecipherable] it
was called Rubenstein. He was from Frankfurt and my parents knew him, and he had a son of
our age, too. And he was wa -- allowed somehow to come to Montpellier [indecipherable] camp
and he went to our house even, but he had to go back to the camp.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: But he was one of the guys that was blindsided, I -- you know, just told him hey, it’s so
beautiful over here, and they showed him the -- how many things that were favorable to show to
-- to the French -- to the internees.
Q: Right. Now, bef -- before we get to talking about you father, and y -- because of these razzias
and their -- razzias and their picking up people.
A: Oh yes.

A: I went to the ORT school --
Q: ORT school, and very --
A: -- in Montpellier.
Q: Yes. And there you learned things that became important for you later, yes?
A: Yes. First of all, I started as a mechanic’s training. Forging -- iron forging -- forge is a French
word, it’s a -- what do you call it -- you know, where you process hot irons.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And where the [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: And then the -- and then I took the class in chemistry, my brother also. And that was very
interesting, it took a few months [indecipherable]. Exam was very strict.
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A: Because you might think it was from the Sorbonne [indecipherable] Paris [indecipherable]
Q: It was good.
A: Yes.
Q: Yes.
A: Laced it.
Q: You did?

Q: Really?
A: Yeah, we had to know how to -- what are you using to make soaps, what are you using to
make lipsticks, what are you using to make toothpastes, and all kinds of -- of what do you call
that, practical chemistry.

Q: I was going to say it’s very practical chemistry
A: Yes, yes.
Q: It’s not theoretical.
A: Yes, it -- the instructor was from Poland, and he was -- he trained us. He was a -- also a
refugee [indecipherable]. He -- I saw him in pa -- in -- in New York when I came back, when I
came over here. I looked him up in the phone book, and tried to get a job, and he took me to his
chemistry factory in Bayonne, and they were -- offered me a job. They did not tell me what it
was, but when [indecipherable] and I says I wouldn’t accept this job, they wouldn’t pay
anything, because the expenses would be higher traveling --
Q: Right.
A: -- than they would want to pay you.
Q: Now why did you take this course in particular?
A: I didn’t want to be idle --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- you know, and then the -- I also had the training in mechanical applications, they had the
other course being taught the same time a -- the same time, later on, so it was good to continue.
Q: Right.
A: Llike it a lot, you know.
Q: And when you’re in Celleneuve, you -- you were Jew -- I mean, people knew that you were

Q: Fred, let’s -- let me just ask you again about Agde, because you and your brother brought in
food --
A: Food.
Q: -- daily to people. W-Were you actually working out -- you had access 11 hours a day.
A: Yes.
Q: Were you really going back and forth all those hours?
A: No, no.
Q: No.
A: Once a day.
Q: Once a day you went.
A: We had -- you know, it was difficult. First of all we had to do the shopping, you had to carry
as much as you could and besides, there was the matter of -- these people have money to buy
anything, yo -- I mean, we were limited ourselves, so we could not actually -- that was not the
case though. The primary thing was, it was quite a distance to walk in the village, too, you know.
Q: It was a big distance, yeah.
A: And do the shopping, and carry it back, you know, it was a --
Q: But the people inside the camp would give you money?

Q: And how did you decide who you would w-work --
A: They asked us, you know?
Q: They just asked you.
A: Because this happened before. People went to -- had the authority to go to see a dentist or a
doctor, or so, and people asked them, would you please buy me this or that [indecipherable]
Q: I see.
A: So th-that already started before.
Q: Right.
A: So for us it was just a matter of stepping in there and help them out too. We had been through
these horrible few days, and we were lucky, it was just a few days.
Q: Right.
A: We felt very badly for those people. I mean, when you’re hungry, it’s a terrible feeling.
Q: Right. So you felt responsible to do something.
A: Absolutely.
Q: So how much -- how long a walk was it from the camp to the village?
A: A few kilometers.
Q: A few kilometers.
A: Yes.
Q: And --
A: And then when you go to the village you have to go to the -- the grocery stores, and you had
to get from th-this end, that [indecipherable] different places, you know, so it took time.

Q: Right. So it must have been exhausting both psychologically and physically for you folks.
A: No, psychologically we felt we had to do it.
Q: So this was --
A: This was a must.
Q: -- this was good. And this went on for a number of months?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: Til about -- well, til about February or so, when they decide to close the camp.
Q: So it’s December, January, February, so it is a few months.
A: Right, yes, it was a few months, yeah.
Q: So it’s a lot.
A: Oh we, you know, I have to -- yeah, we were staying in the [indecipherable] when they
decided to move the people to Rivesaltes.
Q: Right.
A: Yes. And then they had to send a delegation to --
Q: To -- to look at the fake part of the camp, yes.
A: Right.
Q: But after they leave, do they -- do they close the camp in June of --
A: I believe so.
Q: In June of 1941 or ’42?

was February, or something like [indecipherable]
Q: So when you’re at school, the ORT school --
A: Yes.
Q: -- was that in °41 or ’42, do you -- do you have a -- do you remember at all?

A: Yes.
Q: But maybe it’s ’42 that you’re in this school.

chemistry class.

Q: Did you carry around your dictionary with you? Is that one of the things you took?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: No, no. No.
Q: No, huh? So it’s good that you had all this dictionary training beforehand, yes?
A: Yes.
Q: So in July and August of 1942, they start these raids, the Germans --
A: Ah, yes.
Q: -- because they’re occupying Vichy, no?
A: No, this [indecipherable]
Q: This is before?
A: -- before that. Because I remember that they had some raids, or rafles [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: -- and before that -- and we located places to hide.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: People to hide with, food. My father had this one friend of his who had a restaurant,
Tellenbaum, and he provided food. The boy scouts went to different donors or so, they collected
the food. They distributed it to the homes, not on a daily basis, because that would have attracted
attention. So that every two days or three days, they will bring a supply for a few days, so as not
to arouse the people there to see wha -- what goes on there, you know? They found abandoned
houses like that -- things like that. The best place to hide was hospitals.
Q: Why?

A: The food was available. You did not have to bring anything in. Doctors and nurses
cooperated.
Q: They did?
A: They put people in beds, and we -- we were [indecipherable]. That was very -- these were --
these were doctors and Red Cross people and -- and nurses, these are not Jewish. Everybody
cooperated. Not just -- not just --
Q: But your father arranged all of this?
A: Well, he got people -- connections, you know.
Q: Right.
A: But --
Q: But he started it.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: So he just keeps going with these ideas?
A: Because we knew that people were going to be getting arrested, we had to hide them, you
know?
Q: But weren’t you vulnerable also? Or people just didn’t know who you were?
A: We weren’t vulnerable because we knew Ernst. He was in charge of police.
Q: I see.
A: At that point. Now, the people that lived in the same village as we did, Celleneuve, the
daughter was arrested. And we tried to get her freed out, couldn’t --

Q: So s --
A: I’m sorry.
Q: No, no, go ahead.
A: This was before the Germans occupied southern France.
Q: Okay. But in Celleneuve there seems to be a lot of help, the people are -- are willing to be
very helpful to the people who are vulnerable.
A: Well, I’m talking about people who are French citizens basically, because they were not
subject to any persecution.
Q: I see.
A: Because they were French citizens.
Q: Right.
A: Th-They fall under ’36 law -- 1936 law.
Q: And because it’s unoccupied at that point, they’re not vulnerable.
A: Correct, correct.
Q: Uh-huh. And so this goes on now for a few months?
A: Yes, and then the razzias ended the end of -- by August or suppose -- early September, I
believe, they stopped. Then the allies landed in North Africa on August -- on November eighth,
1942. On November 11" [indecipherable] Armistice day for World War I, the Germans invaded

to go according [indecipherable] religion. This is important, he has to help us. Then he sends us
to a mail drop, a Catholic library, to pick up the documents over there. The document -- the

Q: Otherwise he wouldn’t take you, yeah.
A: Right. And then they sent us to librarie Catholic, which is a mail drop for the social security

already against the Vichy government and against the Germans.
Q: Right.
A: So we go back and pick up the visa -- the cards over there, on the 11'"I believe, was the same
day or the next day -- next day, probably. And then we take a train, and go to Nende, which is in

Q: Uh-huh.
A: So, he says, well let’s go to St-Germain-de-Calbert. We took a train to Nende, and we stayed
in the refugee camp overnight, they have them all over the place, and at five o’clock in the
morning, we walk out of camp, and go to the mils -- to the city, and there is a German soldier
with fixed bayonet, standing guard in front of a hotel, where the German officers was s-staying.
We got scared, I mean, you know.
Q: And there were all of you, it’s the five you walking.
A: Yeah.

Q: The next day?

[indecipherable], you know, but [indecipherable] as long as they had orders to record the

A: Yes. And we, you know [indecipherable] in the village. We stay -- first of all we stayed in the
hotel, Hotel Martin, that’s in Poland, because that hotel had an annex, we stayed in the annex.
The hotel itself was already occupied. And he was hiding, we didn't know at the time, 24 Jewish
people, plus about six or seven other ones who were foreigners, Armenians and other
nationalities. They were not hiding from the Germans at the time, but were just hiding from the
French [indecipherable] I guess.
Q: Yeah, right.
A: But -- so anyway, then we [indecipherable] the sequence. I -- I guess we get to meet people
over there. There was a shoemaker who had the sewing machine -- no, no, the -- the -- we were
looking for food, to buy food. Well, we had some money and [indecipherable] and some
silverware and a -- a tablecloth. And they told me that I could probably get food on those items if
I go to a farm on the other side of the hill, on the mountain. Chateau de Cremat, C-r-e-m-a-t. I go
over there and the lady is very nice, and I says, “I came to get some food from you. I do not have
much money, but I can give you some merchandise in trade.” And she said, “Let’s see.” And I
showed her our silverware. Yes, she’s interested. I show her the tablecloth, she’s interested. You
know, before, they were poor, the farms, had not much money to buy those things, and now they
have food when people need it, they can get more money, so now they have money to buy things
Q: Right.
A: -- or for trade. It was great. So I brought home some paté de fois gras. They had pigs, they
slaughtered since war, a-and geese, so it was great. And my parents were really surprised that I

Q: Right, right. And besides paté, what did you bring?
A: Let’s see, paté, potatoes and vegetables, and --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- like th-that.
Q: So the paté was a -- a big luxury.
A: Was the main thing, yes. But -- it certainly was.
Q: So when you’re staying in the annex of the hotel, did you have --
A: Yes, it was just two buildings down the road, with a different entrance and th -- and there’s a
passage under -- underneath it, to get into it like a -- a bridge.
Q: So, do you have a washroom, a shower --
A: Yes, yes.
Q: A shower? You have toilet?
A: Yes. They had about 20 some rooms, and the main hotel was all occupied, and so we had the

but we never admitted who we were. It was obvious we knew each other --
Q: Right.
A: -- we knew who we were --
Q: Right.
A: -- and we had common sense not to mention anything or discuss anything. So I -- I --
Q: So it’s clearly very dangerous at this point, because the Germans can go anywhere, they ha --
they’re occupying --
A: We thought too busy occupy --
Q: Other places?
A: -- other places, yes, the -- the coast -- coastline because the allies had landed in southern
France --
Q: Right.
A: -- the coastline. So Montpellier, Nieme, those places were more vulnerable, you know, for --
for people.
Q: Right.
A: Because they ordered certain areas evacuated, no civilians could live there, too. So it was --
but we were quite a ways from the coast. This was our luck.
Q: So do you sort of settle down and you now have to get work in order to be able to eat, yes?
A: Yes. I-I am not sure exactly when it started, but I found a job with my father to cut down
trees, which were used for the coal mines as support, you know, they have a --

A: Pi -- big pine trees. And we had to cut down 12, our quota. 12 pine trees a two -- for two of
us.
Q: 12 a day for each of you?
A: No, two of them, for both of us. Remove the branches, remove the bark.
Q: Wow.
A: We had a big, long stick with a -- a knife, to remove the bark. And, you know, it was a -- a --

A: And then take the hacksaw -- the -- the -- a big, two man saw, cut the other side and make

A: Right. And that was quite heavy work.
Q: Now, where was your brother? You were --

There is no way for us to get it now.
Q: Right.
A: That was [indecipherable] likely.
Q: And that was okay?
A: Boy, but she was really strict on -- on -- on that, because she would have a -- a Catholic

A: The -- my mom was home most of the time. And we used to go someplace out, my father and

take only one type, it’s an orange type. And if you go take this only, you won’t go wrong.

says, here is little more, here, this. I said, “But it’s your food, don’t.” She said, “No, I’m not
hungry.” You know how mothers are. You will say no?

A: Yeah.
Q: Did you see her lose weight?

A: [indecipherable] be able to do anything.
Q: So no rumors came to you, nothing?

know.
Q: Right. So how hungry were you, Fred?
A: Very, very, very much.
Q: You were very hungry.
A: Very much. Absolutely. The rations that you get officially, were very small.
Q: Mm-hm.

this is -- looks almost like over here, but it was not the same thing. But the rutabaga -- the
rutabaga, that was terrible.
Q: So when you say they were -- they were rationing, that means that everybody in the area was

came from the towns, bought things at high prices, raised the prices for us too.
Q: Right.
A: And we couldn’t afford it.
Q: Right.
A: Now there’s one interesting thing happened, it was one of the underground movements, that

and says okay, let’s have the money back. He said, we paid you, you charge exorbitant prices.

Q: Fred, you were mentioning to me about checks that you were receiving that you still don’t
know --
A: Who sent them, right.
Q: Who sent them.
A: We were in the small village of St-Germain-de-Calbert, and from time to time, for a period of
time they came every month, and then they stopped. The only people I remember in France that
could have possibly send me one is a cousin of my parents who had been in service, got married,
and lived, I believe, in Lyon. But I was never able to identify this because the sending station
was different. The -- the -- the place from where they s-send the checks. And the other
[indecipherable] was, if possible, I understood that maybe some Jewish organization may have
been aware of our existence, and they did not put their name on it. I understand they had some
resources in Switzerland, the -- I forgot what the name of the organization was -- and they could
have possibly done that for a period of time, but I do not know.
Q: But you don’t know.
A: No. It was welcome, because we were --
Q: I bet it was.
A: -- exhausted [indecipherable]
Q: How did it come to you? It wouldn’t come to your place, would it? How did you --

A: Speaking about post office --
Q: Yes?
A: Did I tell you that they censored some letters that were sent out from St-Germain-de-Calbert?
I found out afterwards. If those letters were sent to a German authority, or a French police
authority, they just tore them up.
Q: They tore them up?
A: They [indecipherable] tore up.
Q: And this was because the resistance was working in various places in that small town, but you
didn’t -- you didn’t know this at the time.

Q: There’s an incident where police come, or SS come, I don’t know who it is, comes to your
house and they look through the house?
A: Oh yes.
Q: And -- but they miss what would have been very revealing, am I right?
A: Right. And this was an incident that occurred on April seventh, 1942, in the village -- or north
of the village of san -- St-Etienne Vallee Frangaise. And what happened is, this one
[indecipherable] was a hard to get along fellow, apparently, who wouldn’t take orders from
nobody, and he had a car parked in the street. And some of the local people saw that there was a
submachine gun on the back seat. So they told him to take it away, and he refused, just for spite.

submachine gun on the back seat, and wanted to find out whose it was. Then this
[indecipherable] from the resistance came out, and with this man, and they killed three of them
on the spot. I hear from other sources they were killed two on the spot, one tried to escape, and
was shot under a bridge where he had hidden, and the fourth one was captured and they hanged
him on the gate of a chateau in the same division. A few days later a -- two companies of the Ost

o’clock in the morning with the rifle butts. I opened up the door and they come in, and the
leaders says terrorishn. Are there any terrorists here? My father says, “Il n’ya pas terrorists.”
Then they say, raffen. We understand every single word they’re saying because they’re speaking
German and we understand it. My father ignores it, “Qu’est ce que c’est raffen?” So the guy does
this with his rifle. My father says, “No, Il na pas.” Then they searched the house. On top of
closets, all the doors, the kitchen, every room. And there’s a big overseas trunk in one of the
rooms, bedroom. They open it up -- one of the -- one of the guys open up. They went different
directions, every one had a different assignment. He opens it up, and there’s a drawer of like,
shirts, under which we had our talleissim and Tefillin. Luckily for us, he never lifted that tray.
Had he lifted it, we would have been dead. So he says, “Nicht viel.” Not much. He closes the
cover and goes on looking for more weapons or other things, i-in the whole house. Another one
of them --
Q: May Lask you something? Isn’t it odd that he didn’t lift up -- everybody knows that there’s a -
- a tray.
A: [indecipherable] yeah.

Q: Right? You just lift it up.
A: He didn’t lift it up.
Q: Do you think he did that on purpose? You don’t know.
A: Maybe he was tired already from, you know --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- because they had probably a long day [indecipherable] those -- reason, because they had to
travel quite a bit --
Q: Right.
A: -- to come to the house, too.
Q: Right.
A: So this very strange, I mean, it saved our lives.
Q: Yeah, sure.
A: And a-another one had came into the kitchen, and the radio was there on the table, so he says,
“Radio?” I says, “Ce marche pas.” It doesn’t work. Well, he doesn’t listen, he turns it on. Maybe
he didn’t understand French anyway. So he turns it on and there’s a crackling noise because it
wasn’t functioning. He shuts it down. Then he sees two dictionaries on the table, one French-
German, and one French-English. So he points to the English one, he says, “This good, das
yeah.” So I nod my head. He walks away. Meantime I have a dog barking in the backyard, and I
had to quiet him down because he was waking up the neighborhood, too. Then --
Q: Was that your dog?
A: What’s that?
Q: Did you have a dog?
A: Yeah, a small one.

Q: Really?
A: Yeah, uh-huh. That dog was important because he helped us bring a lady from Martin a few
miles away, she was expecting. And we had to take her to the house to bring her to -- to the
Protestant minister who took care of her to go to the hospital, a Jewish woman.
Q: And how did the dog help?
A: When the dogs came -- when we pass in the night [indecipherable] there, dogs are barking all
over the place, and he never answered back, as if he knew, you know. Otherwise he would have
give us -- gived us away.
Q: Right. So when did you get the dog?
A: I'm sorry?
Q: When did you get the dog?
A: Oh, I don’t recall the exact time, but he was with us for o-over a year or so.
Q: He was?
A: Oh yes. Now, the other German checked under the stairway, and there was a spot there where
they stored normally vegetables, you know, potatoes or whatnot. And he looks in there with his
flashlight, doesn’t see anything. Behind a sheerai -- a wax cloth, we had hidden our false identity
-- ar -- our true identity cards. And he does not see nothing, it matches the color of the rest of the
[indecipherable] and he walks out. So two chance --
Q: That’s pretty scary.
A: Oh yes. And then they walk out, we were very calm, and then we collapse. [indecipherable]
Q: Once they walked out you collapsed?
A: Oh God, yes. That was hel -- horrible. We were very close to getting killed there. Turned out

Q: Do you think they would have just killed you on the spot?
A: Probably not, but they would bring us to the Gestapo.
Q: Yeah.
A: The same thing.
Q: And that would have been -- yeah.
A: Because they would have probably tortured you to try to find out what else you know, who
else you know, yeah, yeah.
Q: Did you think of, after this incident, putting all of these things that could reveal who you are
someplace else? Bury them or something?
A: Well, what happened is, in the building there was a workshop with a dirt floor. And I had
buried those papers in there months before. But we were on the side of a hill, and when it rained,
the water accumulated, the sand was washed out, and the papers were shown.
Q: I see.
A: That’s why I took them from there and hid them.
Q: Oh, I see. So did you leave them in the house after this, still?
A: I don’t recall for sure, but we had not much of a choice [indecipherable] you know. But we
had tried to escape from there, the back wall had the stones -- a stone wall actually, with spaces
in between, and we tried to put in cap -- a couple hooks so we could walk out there. Luckily we
didn’t try, because there were soldiers out there, too. And if we had, we'd be dead.
Q: So a -- I see, it wouldn’t have worked. Did you know that there was a lot -- there were a lot of
people in the resistance in this area, or --
A: Nobody talked very much.
Q: Nobody talked that much.

A: The less we knew, the better off we were.
Q: Right.
A: As a matter of fact, my brother almost got shot. You know, the Germans were taking people
from a certain age [indecipherable] 20 - 21 and 22 for forced labor to Germany.
Q: Right.
A: And it -- you have young people came up from the vi -- cities to hide up there. I found out
after my brother was killed in combat that there was a group of the resistance that was lying in
ambush for him one time, they wanted to kill him. Why? He came to work from the one farm
where he worked, and they thought that the only reason he was in the open and not being
bothered by the police or so is because he must have been collaborating with the Germans. But
the reason was that we were passing for Alsatians, and there was an agreement between France
and -- and als -- and the Germans, Alsatians who were -- some of them were Ger-Germans, some
of them were French, should not be forced to work f -- in Germany. So this one guy from 0 --
well, this is [indecipherable] later on told me that we stopped them from killing your brother.
Q: So tell me something, how does it happen that you and Max go into the resistance? What --
what circumstances s-so that you could get in there in the first place?
A: Well, the resistance rep -- s-single people that were hiding in different places, farms
[indecipherable], after awhile they got organized, and then they got uniforms. They broke into a
uniform factory in Saint Jean Lugar, with the complicity of the owner. He says they broke in and
they took so many uniforms. Once they got a uniform, they figure it’s about time we should join
them guys, too. This is not -- think of us as a -- a -- either against them, or not going to do
anything for -- for France. So --

Q: But how did you know that that was the resistance?
A: How did I know the resistance?
Q: Yeah, how did you know?
A: Because they stayed in a building just south of the village, maybe a few hundred feet south
from there, which was supposed to be a camp for Chantiers de jeunesse. This was Marshall
Pittens idea of taking young people and organizing them for future Frenchmen, you know, o-of --
of his kibo and thing. [indecipherable] too. So we said that -- and they came up and they had
roadblocks on the main highway, so we decided let’s -- let’s join them.
Q: Now, did you talk -- talk about this with your parents?
A: No, no.
Q: You just did it?
A: Yeah.
Q: Were you living with your parents at the time?
A: Yes, oh yes, yes.
Q: And did they know that you were involved, or didn’t they know?
A: No, well they -- they found out, because as soon as we applied there, the guys -- we were g --
on guard duty, y-you know, so many hours of the day --
Q: Right.
A: -- hours of the night. And then we got uniforms too, like they were wearing.

A: Oh, they were very happy.
Q: They were happy?
A: Because of just -- they -- who, my parents, or -- or --
Q: Your -- your parents.
A: Oh, my parents. They had the doubts about that.
Q: They had doubts.
A: But you know, we had made a decision. We could not be in [indecipherable] and people not
knowing if they are on one side or the other side, and that could have been very costly for us
sometimes.
Q: So w -- did this mean that your parents were not safe? Or were they safer because you were in
the resistance? Or didn’t it matter?
A: Well, the people in the village treat us like somebody apart to some extent, you know --
Q: So that you were strangers --
A: -- the parents, they were like strangers to -- to some extent.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Until we joined them, the resistance, everything is fine.
Q: So they knew which side you were on, and then --
A: Yes, exactly.
Q: I see.

terrorists of the French government that took the resistance people and killed them and tortured
them and do everything to them. And the neighbors warned by an anonymous letter, hand carried

to them at night -- not to them, to the house, that they better shape up and get their son out of the
area. So you know, we do take [indecipherable] the situation, too. It -- not knowing who we
were, what we were doing, did not help in that case.
Q: But let me ask you something. How do you actually -- why did they even trust you? You just
went up to them and say we want to join you? I mean, what did -- wh-what did you actually do to
join?
A: Well, some of these were actually local inhabitants.
Q: Yes.
A: Some were from the other cities.
Q: Right.
A: So the local ones were, like I said, the one guy told these -- the other commander not to shoot
my son, so, you know --
Q: Right.
A: -- they realized he --
Q: They -- they knew.
A: -- they did not know, but they were not out to do something unfortunate that could not be
corrected. So, | mean when we said we -- okay, we’d like to join you and help you, stay on duty,

then who are we? We are Alsatians. What are you doing in the mountains? How come you don’t
[indecipherable] as us, you know?

work?
A: Well, they had the sheep in some farm, and [indecipherable] he had 300 sheep --

Q: Or was this your -- your mask?

killed as [indecipherable] so certainly the fact that I consider myself Jewish was definitely
present. [indecipherable]
Q: Right. That was -- that was present, yes.
A: Yeah.
Q: So were you immediately when you got into the resistance, were you trained right away, or
did that take awhile?
A: No, because we had no weapons at that time.
Q: And this is -- is this ’42 or ’43? This ’43?

Germans.

A: Whether they were active or not, it included those who were put in the reserve to get
organized eventually, to be f -- in formations, and be supplied with weapons, too.

the civilians. They want you to turn in the weapons. And so it either may have mentioned what’s

A: -- and his assistant.

A: The knew about it. They just complained about it, but the only problem was that the weapons
were of all types, ammunition was all mixture. It was difficult to have the right ammunition for
the right rifle.

right in the center.” And was he embarrassed.

Q: Did you feel comfortable around weapons?
A: Yes.
Q: You did?
A: Oh yes, yes.
Q: And was that mainly because you -- y-you knew who the enemy was, or does --

them, because we were outnumbered, but at least to defend ourselves.
Q: Right.
A: And that was very important for us.

A: About end of July, he was parachuted as a part of a Jedburgh team. That’s J-e-d-b-u-r-g-h.
Q: And what does that mean, Jedburgh?
A: It’s a -- Jedburgh is a name of a castle out in Scotland. And they were trained over there in
groups of three, usually in the [indecipherable] an officer or non-com, who spoke the language of
the country in which they were parachuted into, because it landed in Belgium, Holland, France,
Yugoslavia, different places, so they had to have somebody who spoke the local language. And
the third one was a radio operator. And the -- the point was for them, first of all, to recognize --
to reconnoiter, to find out where the German troops were, their strength, what were good
objectives to destroy in case of an invasion to block roads and whatnot. We were started on the

use of a plastic explosives, which was a new thing at the time. We were trained in using gammon
hand grenades, there was a special type of hand grenades that they brought to us. That’s just
training, we did not get any of the weapons right away, though, because it --
Q: You got no other weapons?
A: I’m sorry?
Q: You -- you got no weapons?
A: Not right away.
Q: Not right away, uh-huh.
A: There was just the training. And th-then the Jedburgh team drove around to get acquainted
with the various maquis, where they were located, to look for positions, what was important to
destroy to prevent Germans from il -- attacking, or reinforcing troops.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And then, after that they had time in August, to train us. So Bank came back and trained us in
the use of the plastic explosives and they gave us rifles, German, Italian and Russian rifles. Why
these rifles? Those are the ones that -- the Italian rifles were captured in Africa, North Africa, in
Libya, I believe. The German rifles were captured over there too, possibly or in Italy, and the
Russian rifles were captured in Russia. Since the Germans used -- and other Russian troops, and
the German army, I guess they were forced into the service. They had Ru-Russian drivers there,
too. So the problem was that the ammunition was all different in each of the rifles.
Q: The ammunition was different?
A: Yeah. You could not use one with -- in the other rifles, and that was a big problem. The
reason for giving us those weapons too, was the fact that in case of bad weather, they cannot

A: The Hotchkiss machines gu -- machine guns. Some American Browning machine guns, and
basically the -- the heavy stuff was parachuted in there, yes.
Q: And Aaron Bank also parachuted in to this area?
A: Oh yes, oh yes. Well, he parachuted before the equipment, way before.

of maquis in the area?
A: Well, there were many of those teams parachuted in all over France, and even in Germany.

sure that they cannot attack the allied -- allied troops landing in southern France.

A: You -- the maximum they want us to be is maybe 30 at one place, in one location. If you had
too many people in one area, then the Germans would become interested.
Q: Right.
A: And they would try to have big forces surrounding you.
Q: So how many people were in your group, about 20, or was there more?
A: We were in the -- our group, 20. The first was retrained by bake -- by Banker -- Bank,
Colonel Bank.
Q: Yes.
A: And we were then as-assigned a hundred more from a different company that -- from those
who were [indecipherable] were joining us, and they never received the tr-training from him,
they were thrown in the battle without training, with us. So we were the ones who attacked first,
and [indecipherable] to pull back with, and be there to get [indecipherable] for the whole
regiment.
Q: Right.

A: I mean for the whole company. And then we divide ourselves to be mixed with the other ones,
SO We were supporting them and showing them, you know, not to run, a-a-and -- and they had
confidence just because we had the training [indecipherable] that way. And we are not as a single
unit then together, we were divided in combat. We mixed together.
Q: With -- with these other people.
A: Right.
Q: But you’re trained by Colonel Banks for a few days, that’s all?
A: That’s all. That’s all.
Q: And then you were supposed to be organized well enough to go in to battle of some kind?
A: Yeah, that’s right.
Q: So a few days after you get trained, you’re actually in your first battle?
A: Our very first in August, we were in battle. That’s when I led the one group there.
Q: Right. You want to explain what happened?
A: Yes, okay. About 16" or 17" of August, oh I -- I [indecipherable] there, we went down from
the mountains towards Alés, the city of Alés. We stopped at a place called genearagues, g-e-n-e-
a-r-a-g-u-e-s, and we’re in the best position to report any activities, Germans and so forth. And
this was the Saturday, on Sunday morning the people from th -- from Alés came by, they want to
go swimming in the river not too far from there, and they see we are resistance in uniform, and
say, you know, a group is coming in behind us, and those people -- there is one young lady, she’s
17 years old, her boyfriend is a militia, a traitor that is -- was working for [indecipherable], and
those are the people that killed the si -- the resistance people. So I am on guard duty there, and I
stop her, ask for her name [indecipherable] and I arrest her right away, and I turned her over to

the gendarmes. They were in Alés [indecipherable] too. They [indecipherable] her -- then
questioned her, and then they searched her, and she has a pistol.
Q: Really?
A: Yeah, and it was in her chest.
Q: In her -- in her -- in her bra?
A: Mm-hm, a small pistol in her bra. And they kept her overnight because we did not want to
have reports back that the resistance over here. They release her the next day. Her boyfriend was
captured by a Communist group two -- three days later. He admitted that he belonged to the
militia and he was being paid 3000 francs a month, but he claimed to have resigned two, three
months ago. And I had to report this to my captain in my report, and I understand that they killed
him, but I have no proof of that. I was told that they shot him.
Q: Hm.
A: A-Anyway, then they had -- on the 21“, we were told that the civilians -- civilian population
in Alés had risen up against the Germans, and the Germans had killed eight or nine of them in
the city streets. Well, they send us [indecipherable] to -- to reinforce. We were about 30 in that
position. So now we [indecipherable] our groups. We were going up tr -- on a truck first, on th --
one machine gun, and we were at Alés, the Germans had left, because I guess they may have
received orders to retreat and combine with some other units. So my captain -- my lieutenant --
there was a -- there was a re -- assigned different positions to some of the guys. And me he puts
on a pors -- on a [indecipherable] road, he says, report to me if there’s anything abnormal
happening over here, and he goes into reconnaissance. Well, I didn’t know where the
[indecipherable]. Anyway --

A: No, no cell phones. So civilians come back. The French flag is all over the city. And they said
you -- the Germans are coming back there, and the [indecipherable] Alés about 10 kilometers sou
-- south of Alés. I said, oh my God, with the French flag all over the place. We can’t inform
everybody at one time to remove them all at once. We are not strong enough to have a street
fight with them, with the Germans that are come in. What’s the alternative? So we decided we
have to attack them. And I made the decision, there was nobody in charge, and I so -- took the
guys, and because I just took that action, they did not question it, and they base -- my fa --
father’s trait.
Q: I was going to say, you’re just like your father, right, but you were no -- you were what, 19?

A: Combat.
Q: First combat.
A: Combat.
Q: Right.
A: There were 10 guys over there, and I had to take them with me. They did not question. And
then five civilians come over too, to say they want to go with me. I says fine. We had stationed --
we had been stationed in a school that the Germans had abandoned, but they had left a whole
bunch of hand grenades and other equipment there. So I gave the five civilians a hand grenade
each, a potato masher, it’s called. And I took my men in the car -- no, in the truck. There were
some Communists that decided to join us too. I said, okay, come along. So they pile in too, we

go to [indecipherable] Alés, to find that on the [indecipherable] there, the one, the pyramid, did
you ever hear it?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: I didn’t see a pyramid on the -- on your pictures today.
Q: No, but that came after the war.
A: No, no, I mean, I didn’t see it today, you have -- you don’t have it with you?
Q: No.
A: Oh, I [indecipherable] make sure, okay. Anyway, this is where they have the machine gun
that was nine by two, the Communists, that their leader had left to go on a reconnaissance. So I
asked them, what are you -- and he said, oh, our leader is coming back soon. Fine. So I divide
my men in three groups. I took four or five men with me, and the civilians, the five. I sent five
the other way, and the other ones remained with the Communists with the machine gun there.
The Germans were having lunch, they got lunch break, in a farm just south of the village. We
came out from two sides. And we didn’t know how many there were. We were told by civilians
that seen them before there were about 150 in the trucks, 20 trucks lined up.
Q: They had 20 trucks?
A: They were lined up -- there was a farm and the access road through the main highway. The
other side of the farm was land, so they couldn’t even go through there, and I came from that
side. So [indecipherable] somebody fires at the Germans, and they are aware that something is
going on here, and then the one -- one of my civilians to whom I had given a pistol, had three b-
bullets in the pistol, he aims at a German, closes his eyes and fires. I said, my God, you didn’t do
any -- y-y-you think you’re going to aim at anybody that way? I was furious because he give our
position away too soon.

Q: Sure.
A: So the Germans were alert now that there are new -- two groups at least, around here. So they
decided they were forced to go south anyway, so they pulled out. As they were on the highway, I
have come around and I counted trucks, that’s how I knew -- I -- I wouldn’t say 20, it may be 19
plus one or minus one. It was about that number. So they go on and we shoot into the trucks.
Whether we hit anybody or not we didn’t know, because they had the covers o-on the trucks
there. But they go on fine. Then, a short while later -- by the way, the ci -- the Communists were
in ci -- in -- in civilian clothes, so they could disappear in case things got too hot, so the Germans
wouldn’t know them from civilians. The problem was though, if the Germans couldn’t tell who
shot at them, they would take civilian hostages no matter where, and kill them, innocent people.
Anyway, it was [indecipherable] truck came back [indecipherable]. We -- the two groups had
joined them over here that point. And the truck stops with the white flag, and the -- one of my
men gets up and the -- the Germans shoot him in the leg. Th-The -- the time [indecipherable]
timing is [indecipherable]. And we were in the vineyards, it was about that high. We could not
raise our heads because we’d be dead. So I decide to crawl in the -- in the vines between the
vineyard, and go to a farm, which is on the -- one of the pictures I show you. And I go behind,
they have a stairway going up into the attic. I go up there, the door is locked, I take my rifle and
try to shoot the door and lock off. The farmer runs up from nowheres, he says, “Attendez, j’ai la
clé.” Wait, I have the key. I says, fine, open up. And I told him to -- I order him, I didn’t ask him
-- ask him, I told him, remove one tile edge end of the roof so I can see the road, and use the
opening for shooting at the Germans.
Q: Wait a minute, excuse me. Is there something -- there a problem? [inaudible]. All right, so

A: So I’m through to the openings that were [indecipherable] the Germans and my -- one guy
had been wounded already.
Q: Right
A: And the three maga -- the three Communists are still walking towards the west lake, and I had
to stop shooting because of the bunch of th -- they were in the -- in the way.
Q: Because you could have hit them.
A: Could have killed them.
Q: Right.
A: So I go back down and we are taking my buddy, put in a -- well, we -- a ligature, we took a
belt and tied that on. He -- he had been hit in the femoral artery, he was bleeding very badly. Wi
Q: So you tried to stop the bleeding?
A: I-I’m sorry?
Q: You tried to stop the bleeding.
A: Oh yes.
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: Absolutely. So one of the guys says -- had his -- taken his belt off and did that, but we had not
even a Band-Aid, no bandages whatsoever. So then the four of us, we picked up a ladder from
the farmer, it was laid on, and we took my buddy on it, and we had to carry him very low
because the vineyard’s very low to start with, and we could not afford to raise any dust by
dragging him on the soil.

A: So that was a -- some mess there. Anyway, we got him to the village again. Meantime Bank
had been alerted, and he was there with the Commandant -- well, th-the leader of the whole
district. And so I -- I made my report of everything was -- was happening, and the meantime I
find out that the Germans has gone back, they fled.
Q: And what happened to the Communists who went up to the --
A: Oh they were -- they were taking prisoners.
Q: They were take --
A: The Germans took them with them. We found them later on tied to trees with the eyes
punched out and the ears cut off. They didn’t die. Didn’t kill them.
Q: They didn’t kill them?
A: They just let them suffer, and they died anyway, yes.
Q: Oh. So that was your first experience. Did it make you want to not do it again?
A: Well, [indecipherable] says, anybody who is stupid enough to do what you did should be an
officer. So he promoted me and gave me a Croix de Guerre Silver Star.
Q: I see. Were you frightened? At the end, I mean, did it -- did you think, oh my God, what’s --

A: You know you -- there’s a French saying, “La valeur n’attends pas les nombres des années.”
Valor does not wait for the number of years.
Q: Uh-huh, right.

h-o-l-s, la monter is m-o-n-t-e-r, des, d-e-s, silhols, that’s a rise in the road. And we -- I should
say, what happened that night, I was put on duty over there, we had moved position, we had
walked a few kilometers, one after the o -- behind each other, to get new position, and then I was
mid -- charged in middle of the night, on guard duty. At about six o’clock in the morning, my
captain comes along -- not so higher -- n-nothing than the captain. And he says I will have an
arms inspection. Okay. All of a sudden I realized that my bolt had been removed from my rifle.
He had been there during the night and saw me asleep and then he’d removed it. He says, if it
happens again, anybody who is falling asleep on guard duty is going to be shot. I got the
message. So anyway, in the afternoon, I -- he gives me permission to go to Ales, which is a few
kilometers down, for the afternoon. I went to a friend of -- one of the maquisards, who lend me
his bicycle, from his father. So I go to Alés, and guess what, they tell me the Germans are
fighting over there in the [indecipherable]. So I go back on the bicycle, I had only 100 in my
[indecipherable] there and what happened, the tru -- German truck had a trailer with gasoline

behind it. It came from the airport of Nimes. And there were about 13 Germans in the truck, in
the trailer, and -- it was a truck, this was a big truck. Three in the front, one on the side with this
machine gun, and the rest was inside the truck. So they hit the -- our machine gunner who was on
duty at the [indecipherable] over there, and he hit the German who was on the side of the car,
and hit him right in the chest, and he was badly hit there. And then he killed the three in the front
seat. And by that time I had arrived. They had some that jumped off the truck, Germans, some
had escaped. And some were afraid because they did not know which way to move. So then I
looked, and there was a [indecipherable] I don’t know, it’s a ditch --
Q: Mm-hm.
A: -- and there was a pistol in there. I grabbed the pistol, it’s a German pistol, I put my rifle on
my shoulder. And then I go on the side of the truck, and all of a sudden two Germans jump out.
And I was right behind them, so I said, [speaks German here]. Hands up. They do that
immediately, and I [indecipherable] and I bring back to rest of the group. This was so stupid on
ma -- on my part, you have no idea. I did not realize that there was no charger in the pa -- gun,
that the gun was empty, and this pistol has a small lever that goes up if there is a bullet in the to -
- in -- in the chamber, and the lever goes up and -- and the German says geladen, loaded. And it
was down. So if the Germans had faced me, I would have been dead. They would have realized
there was no bullet there.
Q: Right.
A: And I would have been gone. You know, how -- how often can you be lucky?
Q: But did -- did you know this?
A: No.

A: I didn’t know about it, I found out afterwards that --
Q: Afterwards.
A: -- yeah, I found out the thing was empty. I didn’t know about the lever.
Q: So it was good you never --
A: The lever.
Q: -- you never asked these guys to turn around.
A: [know, I -- I -- I was -- they turned sideways, and then I told them to line up, and let them
talk to each other for awhile to see if they were communicating anything that was important,
because I wanted to find out how many had escaped. So this point then told them
[indecipherable] you know? They realize I spoke German also, and they -- they stopped talking.
Then we took them in to a -- no, there was one more guy that had escaped and was captured, and
th -- they had dropped the machine -- the guy that was on the side of that, you know, truck had a
machine gun, but somehow or other that pulled off the -- what they were -- the mechanism is to
fire. So my captain told me, ask him where the piece is, and tell that you’re going to kill him if
he doesn’t tell you, or how it functions, so forth. So I told him in German, and I tried to be a
serious as possible and hey, you know, threatening. And he says, I’m sorry, I -- I was a fireman
at the base in ni -- Nimes, I was not in the infantry. [indecipherable] know that’s a lie, because
everybody gets trained for weapons. But anyway, we couldn’t find the -- the missing piece, and
then we took him to Alés with the truck that was damaged, the se -- the windshield was shot out.
We took the wounded German with us, we brought them to lycée, a school in Alés that served a -
- as a hospital, and I think he couldn’t make it though, because he had been really badly shot
right in the chest.

A: And the German prisoner, I took him then to the city hall, where they had an officer that was
interrogating prisoners. So we passed a truck that had been brought there already, and he asked
me to go to find his -- I don’t recall that there -- it’s -- it’s a gamere, it’s where you eat, you
know, it’s like a metal dish or some [indecipherable] that you can fold, and so -- and said what is
that, because that were --
Q: Is it a mess kit?
A: -- mess kit, yeah.
Q: Is it a mess kit, yeah.
A: And then that word I didn’t understand, it was a -- I’m not [indecipherable] and then he
explained that to me, and I -- and I said, okay. Look, I'll let you go up in the truck and find it, but
I’m going to shoot you if you have anything else. And he went up -- up -- klamotte, that was the
name, k-l-a-m-o-t-t-e, klamotte. I had to translate -- I have to spell German, too.
Q: Right, right.
A: Anyway, he come back out and I turn him in to the -- interrogating officer, which was a G2
mit -- milit -- military intelligence, and they took over from there. They put all the prisoners in a
-- in jail, actually, cause they had no other place for them, except in the jail.
Q: Right.
A: So that was then th -- oh no, before that, we knew some had escaped in the -- in the fields, so I
took him along and some of my guys and the friends there came along. We went to a farm, and
the farmer offered us anisette. It’s a French drink, it’s a very strong, good thing, and I feel sorry
for the guy. Are you thirsty? Is he thirsty? Yeah. So I says, okay, give him bottle.
[indecipherable] anisette. He was so happy, he was -- it was August, it was very hot, too. And I
took him to town.

Q: Right. Now the end of August, something really terrible happened when you were --
A: Yes. There was one more incident in between --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- but I was not involved that one because I was not selected to that team. But that was a
party, a very small thing, there was no -- nobody killed. [indecipherable] like that. Germans
[indecipherable] escaped then.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And on the 27" of August, early in the morning, it’s a Sunday, our captain gives the order to
take his troops to a certain crossroad to prevent the Germans from coming back towards Alés.
And he’s told it’s a very strong column. Civilians had been informed by a German medic who
had been well [indecipherable] by them [indecipherable] that they should get away from their
homes because a big column come by and they are fierce guys, they are Russians -- they were
Tatars, Mongols, about 2000 of them, Russians, and a thousand Germans or so. So somehow she
got the message through to the resistance that we should be careful, the troop will be coming by.
So my captain was ordered to intercept them. We got there, it’s too bad -- I had the pistol, the --
the mats we were in, the hills. And he located us on a certain perim-perimeter. There were three
hills there, and then the horde was going right between them.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So he was a good tactician. He was a captain in the artillery, in reserve, and he found us
excellent positions there. There were two machine guns that were in a rocky area, and they had
the -- a domineery -- domineering positions and we -- our group, the commander, the 20, were
set up at front, right as the road turns and the Germans came from that direction. So we were
hard in position, it was hot as can be. And thirsty, you know, nothing to drink. Anyway, we hear

horses galloping around there, and then we see motorcycles coming, and there’s a patrol,
German, reconnoitering the area. And one fellow on the machine gun fired too soon. The
Germans were not supposed to be attacked until they were in certain position where we had a -- a
larger group under fire. And I guess he may have t -- hit some motorcyclists there, and then the
Germans spread all over the place. We fought them for about seven hours. It was terrible. I
mean, we were in good positions, we were on the hills, they were in the plain, and --

Q: Okay. I’m sorry for the interruption.
A: No, no, no, no, it’s okay.
Q: So you were in battle for seven hours --
A: Yes.
Q: -- and you were in the stronger position, and nevertheless you still weren’t able to stop them.
A: Well, they couldn’t advance, actually. [indecipherable]
Q: Yeah, they couldn’t -- I see.
A: But then they came around on the right flank, they went around the hill, and we found out
about that, so we -- the [indecipherable] and we -- a machine gun that was moved over to stop
them, too. We found out certain things afterwards. For instance the commander asked -- he was a
major, asked civilians if the resistance had been in the village. And he says, yes, they came by
for some water, but we didn’t know who they are, we did not cooperate with them.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: That’s fine. And then he asked how many were they. So this young kid apparently told them,
oh, probably a th -- a thousand or so, exaggerating. But the major laughed and told him yeah,
probably a hundred, 200, which is actually quite -- we were 120 [indecipherable]. Anyway, they
took a hostage in the village, a poor guy that had come back from work and had gone to see his
parents. And they thought he was a terrorist also, and they tied him up, I fo -- found out later on,
on the back of a horse drawn carriage, and dragged him to his death. He was dead. There was
one captain that was apparently a -- a -- a [indecipherable] one, and he’s the one that got all of
this. There was one lieutenant apparently, in the German outfit that when they tried to shoot
some -- one of the civilians that were there, called Commandant, Commandant. Our

Commandant was over there, he asked what was going on, so he said, don’t shoot the civilians.
So you know, this is -- we found out afterwards. Anyway, we had to have more help. So our
captain sent a motorcycle -- m-motorcycle -- motorcyclist to the headquarter of Bank and said
we need some support. And Bank immediately called up by radio -- there was a carrier -- aircraft
carrier in the Mediterranean, and he asked for a-assistance. And they said they will send two
planes. And th-the message came back to us, they will be there in half an hour, and it took about
an hour, but anyway the two planes came in, machine gunned the Germans. They came in very
low, just [indecipherable] circled, and they machine-gunned them. And that slowed the Germans
down, and we had time to pull back, because we had to -- we could not hold the positions any
more. At that time the Germans -- when the planes left -- we were stupid, too. When the planes
were over, we got very excited and we took out hankies and we waved at them, you know? That
was a bad move because Germans saw where we were, our positions. As soon as the planes left
we got hit by artillery you wouldn’t believe. I mean, it came down raining like anything. And
apparently my brother was killed there, but I did not know that at the time. The captain ordered
us to pull back, and on the way down the lieutenant said, “Fred, we need you down by the car.”
There -- there was a -- a [indecipherable] parked [indecipherable] and when we got on there he
says, “Max is dead.” I said, “What? What happened?” We -- we were close by, but there was a
hill and he was on one side, at a [indecipherable], and I didn’t see it. The bi -- shells -- the shells
were falling all over the place. And he says yes -- and he say -- and I -- when I moved to go
back, he -- he -- he stopped me. And he put me in the car and drove me home -- to the next
village. Next morning we go back, there was one of our men had been left behind. He apparently
could not follow us, and he had 29 Russian prisoners with him. And how do you do that? He
says, well, I saw them over there, and they were trying to hide, and there I was, so I point to them

[indecipherable] and they surrendered. So we got close to them -- because they wanted to
surrender, they didn’t want to fight with the Germans any more. So when we got close, then
lined up and my lieutenant -- there’s a difference between lieutenant and the captain, they always
interchange you know, whoever was in charge at the time. So my lieutenant tries to speak to
them, he doesn’t speak Russian, and I don’t speak Russian either. And then this Russian soldier
goes, heil Hitler. And I take my rifle [indecipherable] and kill him. So my lieutenant puts my
rifle down, and the Russian’s leader tells him, no, this is -- salute this way, not this way. He was
lucky, he nearly got killed over there. But I understand, I mean, he did not know, you know,
there was -- there were -- leaders, many of them didn’t know what the heil Hitler meant to a -- to
the French. And then we went -- during the night, more had surrendered, and we had captured a
total of about 300 [indecipherable] citation from the German, 300 prisoners. And some
surrendered in the morning, some had gone to the next village and surrendered over there. So we
captured all of them. Couldn’t believe it. N-Not many Germans, all Russians, yeah.
Q: Not many Germans in that group?
A: They were -- no. They were pretty fanatics. They wouldn't surrender, those guys.
Q: When was your brother buried? Soon after?
A: Yes. So the same afternoon, they brought -- put him on a truck and they told me to go on, and
they had an honor guard in the truck, too. Went back up to the village, in Saint -- St-Etienne
valais Francaise, which is the city before St-Germain-de-Calbert, they had already no-notified
the people that we are coming. The honor guard were there. [indecipherable]. Then I got home
and my father co-comes down the street there. He said, “Oh, that’s my son, shot.” We brang him
in, my mom and my sister are there. It was terrible.

A: I’m sorry?
Q: You were the one who told them that -- that Max was dead, or --
A: No, because the -- they had oper -- the news -- they fied -- the telephone operator at the post
office.
Q: Really?
A: And they had notified my parents we were coming in. Then we s-stayed at the house the o-
overnight, and then the lady whose son had passed away the week before said that we should
bury him next to her son. And they put him in a double coffin, because we told them that we are
going to move him from there. [indecipherable]
Q: It must have been awful.
A: Yes. And then the eulogy from the pastor -- the protestant minister [indecipherable]
translation?
Q: Mmn-hm.
A: Yes. There’s about 800 people showing up his funeral.
Q: 800.
A: Almost the whole village. And o-other villages, too, you know. Well, after that I stayed a few
days in the village, then I was sent back to my unit, and at -- was transferred to -- my parents
went back to Montpellier, because this was all free at that point.
Q: At that point -- it was a kind of liberation at that point?

A: Well, he was part of the liberators from Montpellier. So things had settled down. The same
thing is with the resistance. They had organized, but they were not in office yet, but they have
pre -- they had made preparations to take over as soon as possible. So it didn’t take much time to
get in -- take over the -- the officer there.
Q: So you have very little mourning period for your brother. I mean, you’re home for a couple of
days and then you have to go back.
A: [had to go back, yes.
Q: Was that be -- was that better for you, that you could go back and work?
A: I wanted to go back.
Q: You wanted to go back?
A: I want the Germans.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: My parents did not object to me going back.
Q: They didn’t want you to go back.
A: They did not object.
Q: They didn’t object.
A: They knew why I wanted to go back.
Q: Do you think they were afraid that something would happen to you?
A: If they were they wouldn’t let me know.
Q: They didn’t say
A: And maybe they were also more or less -- they saw down that they had the anxiety, you
know, they will not see things. Then, I went back to -- with the major, to whom I wrote about --
the lieutenant had lied, you know, about my combat. And he took me back to our unit. And then

later on I was -- my parents were in Montpellier, I was transferred there, and I was transferred to
the headquarter of the division as the interpreter for de Chambrun, who [indecipherable] and they
gave me my rank, and my -- my rank at that time [indecipherable] it was on the 14" of July. And
then I was in G2, Deuxiéme Bureau.
Q: And is that because your brother was killed so that you could not be in the armed resistance
any more, or was this because there was liberation at that --
A: Well, the Germans [indecipherable] by that time, there was nothing to --
Q: There was nothing to do.
A: [indecipherable]. Then they took the other guys that were in my outfit and they put them in
the regular army, those who volunteered.
Q: I see.
A: And then they got the French uniforms on the [indecipherable] so the one will have all
[indecipherable] on --
Q: Mm-hm.
A: -- as well as afterwards. They were organized at the 81‘ regiment. It was [indecipherable].
There is a rule in the French army, if you are sole surviving son, you don’t go back in combat,
you know.
Q: Right.
A: Because they want the family tree to continue. As long as you are in combat, and one has
been killed in combat --
Q: Right.
A: -- then the other one doesn’t go back in.

A: But that was not reason there yet.
Q: Right.
A: They trust me.
Q: So it was different for you. So now you are in the intelligence.
A: G2.
Q: Yes.
A: And the first thing that happens, they had me first day, German manuals.
Q: German manuals?
A: Yes, they had the weapon man -- manuals about the certain glass jars [indecipherable] it was,
there was a manual with it, I found out that these were firebombs. You break them and
everything, it goes up in fire, you know. And machine guns were different [indecipherable]
became busy and then later on my -- the Commandant de Chambrun, was replaced because he
wasn’t wer -- found to be untrustworthy because I think somehow or other he had the affiliation
with the Communists. And that goes way back, and he was [indecipherable] let him completely
from the res -- from the army. In comes General -- Colonel Zeller, at the time, and he puts
together all the officers of his headquarter, shakes their hands, looks at me. And next thing I
know, he gives me first rate, a -- a book in German. He spoke German perfectly, but he did not
want to let on. And what does he give me? A book on a house of ill repute that the Germans have
recorded the names of the girl [indecipherable]. He says, what is this about? He just wanted to
pull my leg, you know? What a character. But he --

A: -- [just said that -- that’s what it is, you know.
Q: That’s what it is, that’s the end of that.
A: Yeah. He knew that. But I knew what he was up to, just to try to give me a hard time because
I -- a young guy. And then I was very much involved with interrogating prisoners of war. There
was one that -- a few of them volunteered information so they could [indecipherable] before.
And one was -- said that he had a gir -- a ger -- a French girlfriend, and she was expecting. And
she got in touch with her office, she would like to have [indecipherable] father. And he said that
he was an Alsatian, not a German, so they sent me out to investigate. And sure enough, he says,
well, my father was working in Alsace-Lorraine at one time, as a waiter. I says to --
Q: A waiter?
A: Waiter in a hotel -- in a restaurant, yeah. I says, and are you Alsatian? H says, no, my father
was working there. Okay. I wrote back a [indecipherable] report, and I se -- send them to the --
they moved o -- the mines in the -- on the beaches. I was so furious that they tried to take
advantage, I say, you know, these French [indecipherable] but I told them --
Q: Where’d they put him?
A: I tol -- I told them to send him to the mine field.
Q: To the mine fields.
A: Yeah, because the Germans were set to remove the mines on the beaches there.
Q: I see.
A: In southern France, and because he had done that, I figured he should be punished.
Q: Right.
A: I -- Iwas a bad guy.

A: Yeah. And then the other one --
Q: The-They did what you asked?
A: Oh yes.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Oh yes. The -- you know, the -- he speaks German, th -- my officers, I accepted the job
[indecipherable] involved in this case. And then there was a case where I mentioned before, this
one was employed by [indecipherable] and he was to -- he has impor-important information for
[indecipherable]
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So I drove past Nimes to the farm, and then he told me that the -- this was much later, though,
when Germany had surrendered in -- in May, I believe, ’45. And he told me that the 19 German
army who had come from that i -- from our area, had broke up some dirt in a school yard, and
buried all the radio equipment in there, which is valuable stuff to have, you know. And had
dumped all the electrical wiring over the side of a cliff. So I made a report to G2 and they sent it
to general -- General [indecipherable] group -- well he is -- he was the [indecipherable] marshal
later on, but he sent his G2 officer there, and they checked into it. I haven’t heard from him since
then.
Q: Right. Were you also in charge of military mapping?
A: Yes.
Q: What was that -- what does that mean?
A: Okay. Each headquarter has a mapping department.

A: It’s a -- a -- a division has the maps for combat if they have to go so and so [indecipherable]
such a place, they have to have maps of all the areas, copies of them at least. They can always
make copies later on, they have a special p-process. So they figured hey, you can do that. Well,
what happened first, he says, they had a map of the combats in Russia, and they had this
lieutenant who kept it up to date. They had the string with a [indecipherable] attached on the
bottom, and they had pins there, and they had the string going with pins and show the progress
from one day to the next. So he got a different assignment so they put me in there, because they
had the BBC every day, they were listening on the radio, and [indecipherable] information as to
the progress m-made by the Russians on -- on their front. [indecipherable] in Europe, but also I
guess they didn’t trust the Russians either at that time. Anyway, so they put me there, and then
[indecipherable] that’s not enough work for you, so they give me the mapping department. So I -
- I found out that fish market in Montpellier was selling fish and wrapping them in that excellent
paper which is used for maps. So I sent somebody to investigate and he said they have a whole
bunch maps in a certain place in Alés. So I found out about that. I took two German POW’s, and
one guard to go with me, and the chauffeur. And we went over there and took back about 20,000
maps. That was a gold trove. Those maps are expensive to -- to make. And they -- some were
overwritten in German, but they were actually French, French maps that they had captured
before. So the general was very pleased, and he had me make some shelves for all of those, it
was quite a job.
Q: 20,000?
A: 20,000 maps. You know, it was [indecipherable] to the French army.

Q: Right.
A: Maps, you know.
Q: When -- when your parents go back to Montpellier --
A: Yes.
Q: Yes?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you then go back with them and live with them and --
A: Yes.
Q: -- and still work in the armed -- and -- and are you based in Montpellier now?
A: Yes.
Q: You are.
A: The headquarter division is in Montpellier.
Q: In Montpellier.
A: Then my father meet some people there, and he said, you know, we have a lot of people
coming back from the camps. We got to do something for them. And he got in touch with Jewish
organizations, I guess in Paris [indecipherable]. And they were assigned the responsibility for
helping those people. And they had about eight or 10 different organizations in that federation.
My father was director of the one federation, and five locations in the States, in those days were
on there [indecipherable] the cities. So they obtained money to give out to the refugees, a -- a
monthly sum. My father says, no, that is not what you should do. We don’t have to give charity
to those people, they need something more substantial so they can get back on their feet, like
human beings. Those were profession -- excuse me -- we should try to get them the equipment
that they need to go back in their professions. I remember of two specific instances, I guess. One

was the shoemaker who needed shoe -- the equipment to repair shoes, and they were able to se --
he said okay, we should try to give them a lump sum, equivalent to maybe one or three years of a
charity. If they have the money later on, they can repay it and if not -- either they can give more
to other people, but if not, there you go. And they agreed to that. So he was able to get enough
money for the people to buy equipment that they had needed, and that was an excellent idea,
because the people had self respect again. They came from the camps and had lost all the --
Q: Now, was this money given to men, or to both men and women?
A: Whoever applied. The women got the money to live on, but the -- there was actually to go
back in business, if they had some business of sorts, yes. But otherwise they -- they didn’t have
to get that much money, but if they were a family, so that helped, you know.
Q: Right. Now, there’s this period --
A: Very few -- I am sorry -- very few women come back from that -- from there to Montpellier.
Q: More men came back. Many more men.
A: Not ma -- not many. Not many.
Q: Not many men either.
A: Compared to the women there were more men, but not that many, no, no.
Q: But not that many anyway.
A: There were few hundreds probably, at the time. [indecipherable]

to -- to do something, do you know what I mean? There’s this period of great activity of your
father.
A: Oh yes, I know [indecipherable] because they had the different groups. One helped the people
from the camps, and then that o-organization to provide them food, and the other organizations
to try to find family members, housing and so forth. And then I was called in once by one of the
attorneys, yeah, to go with him. One -- or big department store had been taken over by Jewish
organization -- the -- the Vichy organization for confiscating Jewish property.
Q: Right.
A: So he says, look, we have to reclaim this property. The people there had been -- had
disappeared, we don’t know where they are, but we want to get this back into our control in case
the people come back. So some local women had bought the property of -- at a auction.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So I said fine. He told them they should be at h -- at the office -- at the -- at the store at one
o’clock in the afternoon. I took one soldier with me -- I was an officer at that time, and he went
with me. We got there and I -- he says, turn over your keys. They turned over the keys, good-
bye, and he assumed responsibility for his clients. I hope so.
Q: Mm.
A: You know [indecipherable] can happen.
Q: Right.
A: But that was a -- an activity at least it was justified, take property back first and worry about
restitution --
Q: So how soon after the war do you -- or after your liberation, do you discover what had gone
on in eastern Europe, and the murder of the Jews? Do you -- was it months, was it later than that?

A: Probably three months, because when they rescued people in the camps --
Q: Yes.
A: -- they came out.
Q: And then they told you.
A: Yeah. Newspapers, or --
Q: So this must have been a huge shock to you.
A: Absolutely, absolutely. We did not know the extent. We knew some camps, because the first
one was like maybe Mauthausen in Austria, where some of the first was liberated by the western
powers. Russians liberated Auschwitz.
Q: Right.
A: So, you know, a different time frame.
Q: It’s -- right. Did that -- was that extremely depressing to you? I mean, what were --

Q: Now your parents lose close relatives.

A: That’s right. And then we found out, when Jackie, the young boy came back out of
Flossenberg, and the colonel left him with us, then we found a lot more of what happened over
there.
Q: So tell that story a little bit, this is a -- a -- somebody --
A: Okay, there was American troops in -- went in Germany, they liberated the camp of
Flossenberg, F-1-o-s-s-e-n-b-e-r-g, and they find this little boy, he’s about 14 - 15 years old, and
this American Major Leland, he was American officer, decides that he has no parents any more,
well the boy told him he had no more parents, and he wants to adopt him, eventually. So he goes
with him -- takes him with him in the unit for awhile. He gets an americ -- an American uniform,
you know [indecipherable] troops, and then when he was transferred out to Avignon. There was
a big [indecipherable] Aix [indecipherable] Aix - Aix -- Aix-en-Provence. And the troops are
there, the major has a brother over there who’s also a doctor and they come to visit Montpellier.
And somehow or other they come to a Jewish committee of the organizations and they meet my
father, and they mention about the little boy -- the boy comes with him too. After awhile the
major is supposed to go to the Pacific, and he has met my father, so he asks him what -- will you
take care of the boy? He was more welcome because my parents were still missing my brother
and now he would fill in --
Q: Right.
A: -- a -- a void. So said, sure. And he asked when Leland send a letter to [indecipherable] you
before, asking him to help out. Then a -- a few weeks later he makes -- he asked my father make
arrangements with the American consulate in Marseilles. So when the papers are ready, the

amb -- the consul asked my sister, “Don’t you want to go to America, too?” She says, “Yes, but
we can’t.” Why not? “It will take years for us to get papers.” He says, “Send me your papers.” It
was the beginning of -- it’s the end of May. I [indecipherable] the beginning of March ’46. We
send the papers in and within a month time we have papers to come to the United States. Now,
this was tricky, because you had to have the ships cards, too. Now it’s just a Peter or Paul, which
comes first. They would not give us actually the visa. Yes, you ha -- they’re coming to you, but
you must show us the visa -- the -- the ship cards, and vice versa. Anyway, I found out that the
French government had some places available on a boat repatriating French citizens back to
United States who had come back to France to fight. So they were -- had priorities to go back to -
- see. And that included also people in the resistance. When I found out that, I said okay, let’s get

Q: So you arrived in 1946 in New York.
A: Well, we arrived in norfo -- no, norfo -- Virginia, yes.
Q: Norfolk, Virginia?
A: No, no, no, it’s a -- it’s north -- it’s a port -- no. It’s a Navy port there.
Q: Is it in Virginia?
A: I’m sorry?
Q: In Virginia?
A: Yeah, I’m quite sure it was, because we had two storms in the Atlantic. We had a small boat,
a -- a liberty ship, 10,000 ton, which was [indecipherable] more than the sea. Newport -- no. Oh
God, Norfolk? No, it was Norfolk, Virginia, I guess.
Q: Norfolk?
A: Uh-huh. And then we -- somebody called the news organization over there to receive us, and
then get us to the train station.
Q: Right.
A: So they sent a lady over there, and --
Q: And then you went to New York?
A: Yeah.

A: No.
Q: So that must have been disappointing to him.
A: I suppose. What happened is, my father raised the roof when he -- when we came over here,
he went to the Jewish organizations in -- in New York, and Jackie was being taken care of by
somebody over there.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And he asked them, do you give him any money -- pocket money, anything to go to the
movies or stuff like that? No, no. He raised the roof, he says, this child has the right to li -- live
like a child. You have a nerve not to -- you know, to treat him as one. And he -- he was really
mad. He helped him out. They put -- put him up with somebody and he wa -- got very friendly
with the people to the point that he changed his name to their name.
Q: So they had -- did they adopt him?
A: No, no.
Q: They didn’t?
A: No. I guess they had children of their own already.
Q: So he never had a f -- a family growing up when he was a teenager.
A: No, well except when he -- except when he got married.
Q: Right.
A: Had his own two -- two children, yes.
Q: Right.
A: Three children.
Q: Hm. Now, I understand that you -- you all moved in August of 1948 to Arizona because your

A: Well, he had a heart condition in -- in St-Germain-de-Calbert already.
Q: I see.
A: And he had seen the doctor over there, and they couldn't do too much over there. We came
over here, and he was here in the winter of ’46, and we came here in ’48 -- yeah, ’47 was bad
also, doctor says get out of New York, go to wa-warm climate. So what he did, we wrote to
chambers of commerce in Arizona, New Mexico, California and Colorado. And we asked what
is situation for jobs and housing. Now remember that this was a time when many soldiers were
being discharged, and they were looking for housing too.
Q: Right.
A: So it was a competition and for jobs. And they were all discouraging except Arizona. The
respondent said, there’s always an opportunity. Come and see for yourself. And so his relatives
in New York said, you go to Arizona? Aren’t you afraid of the Indians?
Q: Out of the what?
A: Of the Indians?
Q: Indians.
A: Yeah, Arizona? So my father says look, I crossed the ocean to see the Statue of Liberty, and
[indecipherable] Indians. And he came back [indecipherable] he didn’t speak the language. He
went to a Jewish organization and they send him to a -- [indecipherable] presidents who told him
to check [indecipherable] to a real estate agent who will find a place for us. And they -- he made
a lot of connections over here. He was the kind of a person to -- you know --

A: Not much, not much. But to some of the people he could speak [indecipherable] too, you
know.
Q: Right, right.
A: So you know, no problem. And then after a few weeks he had rented a store and then we
came over here too. And the first thing we did is buy some radio equipment -- equipment to
repair radios. [indecipherable] check tubes, radio tubes and -- and al-all that. And since I’d been
[indecipherable] I knew all about that. So we opened up the --
Q: So you s -- so you started open -- repairing radios?

A: Yes, uh-huh, yeah. [indecipherable]

A: Yes. We went to a synagogue over there on services, and she met this young man, and just --

A: And lived in our neighborhood, and we knew a person across the street from there and he said
-- he came over to me, “Fred, this young lady came from New York, she doesn’t know anybody,
can you take her to the Jewish center to introduce her to young people, her age?”
Q: Right, right.
A: Said sure. You know, I -- I wouldn’t pay attention to me, after all, she is 16, I’m 26, you
know, it’s just like, when you’re 90 and a hundred it doesn’t make a difference --
Q: Right.
A: -- between 16 and 26? So --
Q: [indecipherable] it makes a big difference, right?
A: Okay, so I took her down there, she met people there, and then she met -- she finally married
someone that she knew in New York but had come out here. And when he passed away about a
few years later, I --
Q: So they weren't married for very long?
A: No. Maybe five, six years, I suppose.
Q: Mm.
A: Uh-huh. Then she came by the store, I had the radio store downtown, and she had a baby
carriage and the wheel broke off right in front of the store. So I happened to see it, so I said okay
[indecipherable] I take you home. Put the cart --

brother and I was with my sister and my brother.

and I had a day off on Wednesday afternoon from work. I said, hey, how about taking the kids
for a wal -- you know, mountain climbing or an -- she said sure. And we got acquainted, and she
[indecipherable], I got married.

Q: Right.
A: And so that was that. I went almost out of radio business to get the TV business. Then after a
few years, this -- no, I -- what happened is when I got married to Marilyn, I married her in July
of 62.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: But I said, you know, and I had been taking her and the kids out for weeks, for -- I said, you
know what? I have to leave more time free. I’m not going to have somebody call me at 10 -- 11
o’clock at night that they missed their football or boxing or whatever it is, and I want to have my
weekends also. And that’s the only way I can marry someone, we’ll have some free time.

A: And I was in charge of the controls, the quality of the semiconductors that went into the
computers. If that failed, it could be a real problem, you know?
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: So and then those [indecipherable] one, two and three were obsolete and then I got -- I lost the

Q: Ho-How do you think the war -- I don’t even know if this is a question anybody can answer.
Ho-How do you think the war changed your life or affected your life afterwards, or did -- do you
not think about it that much?
A: I think about it every time I see a war going on someplace else. Oh, only I forgot to tell you, I
lived in a big apartment of 11 rooms, across the street from the general’s headquarter in
Montpellier.
Q: This in -- this is in Montpellier?
A: Yes.
Q: Yes.
A: And there was two sides to it, one had four rooms -- five rooms, the other one six rooms. The
lieutenant and his wife had one side, and I was on the other side with my parents. The lieutenant
was transferred out, he was a military justice officer, and I had a whole 11 rooms there. One day
a colonel from the headquarter says, “Loewy, I want to talk to you. Your apartment, I want it. Pll
give you one month to find another apartment.” I said, he had collaborated with the Germans and
he wants me to give him the apartment? No way. A month goes by, “Loewy, have you found
something?” I said no. He said, “I'll find something for you.” So he finds something and he says,

“Loewy, I want you to move out.” I said, “I refuse.” “You what?” He’s -- what happened then?
Had me called before the commander of the garrison, colonel. And they -- they say -- the two of
-- I-I took an attorney with me. I was cautious there. You’re sure [indecipherable] give up the
apartment? I said, it’s not a military matter, it’s a civil matter. Had nothing to do with
[indecipherable] o-or anything else. You are refusing? Yes, I refuse. And then the other colonel
bawls me out. Then I said to him, “Colonel, do you know your army regulations?” Yes, I do.
“And you Colonel, you know your army regulations?” Yes I do. “What right do you have to talk
to me that way in front of a non-com?” I said, “No, no, you cannot insult somebody in front of a
lower rank military.” He turned all colors. And they send him out, and then that didn’t happen
again. At two o’clock in the afternoon I’m called to see the general, and the general says, “You
got to get out of there. You have to go out, period.” I tell my parents [indecipherable]
apartments, they said, “Let’s get out of here, forget about it. Let him have it.” I move out of
there. Before I move out, I have a friend of mine in G1, which is military personnel, the French
army. And he says, “Fred, what’s going on?” I said, “What do you mean what’s going on?” He
said, “They are talking about sending you to Africa, to repatriate Senegalese troops.” I said,
“What?” I said -- he says, “We know when the ships go there, we don’t know when they come
back.” Oh-oh, I figured that the -- the colonel was behind it. The next day he says -- he calls me
up in secret because clearly I wasn’t supposed to know what’s going on there. He says, “Now
they are trying to send you to Vietnam -- Indo-China.” Not Vietnam, Indo-China. I says, time for
me to get out of the army. So I had signed up for the army for the duration of the war, and why I
did this, I put down in ink, in Europe. So the war is over in Europe. So nothing happens, nu -- so
I figure they are going to send me out before I have a chance to get out of the army. So I send a
letter to the general, “General, I demand my discharge.” Nothing happens. So I just had to go one

afternoon I got dischar -- discharged. They knew I wasn’t going to play around then.
Q: Now, when did you get the medals for your work in the resistance?
A: On 14" of October -- oh, on 14" of July, 1945.
